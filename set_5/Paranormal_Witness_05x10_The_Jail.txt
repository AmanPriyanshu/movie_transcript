D Tower houses the worst of the worst.
Super-max, if you will.
Boom, baby!
(LAUGHS)
Open up!
Come here!
It's dark and it's dirty.
It felt like it was a predator stalking me.
It knows where I am.
There is something very dark going on here.
This is going to kill me.
(SHRIEKS)
(METALLIC DOORS SHUTTING)
(TWANGY GUITAR MUSIC)
(POLICE RADIO CHATTER)
I was proud to wear the badge.
I was proud to be a detention officer.
2009, I was being transferred to Estrella Jail, which is an all-female facility.
From 8:00 p.m. in the evening to about 6:00 in the morning.
But what's the worst that can happen?
I walked in to check in with security control.
(EERIE MUSIC)
(KNOCKS)
Hello?
And I'm kind of waving at the camera like, 
Hello?
It's Officer Yates. It's my first day.
Can you let me in?
Nothing.
Just nothing.
And there was definitely anxiety of meeting the new team.
Okay, folks.
Just a few items for today.
You know, are people gonna say, "Hey, what's up, how're you doing?"
You know, "Glad to have you on board."
We have a new officer with us today.
Welcome aboard.
Jay Yates, welcome.
Thank you.
So you will be partnered up with Officer Brown.
Okay?
Officer Yates, I'm Officer Brown.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
I was wet behind the ears. I was green as possible.
I was a, uh, complete rookie.
I got it.
He was a kid. That's really my impression.
Officer Brown and Officer Yates are gonna be up on D Tower tonight.
D Tower is a housing unit, um, that we house 
Super-max, if you will.
Officer Brown and Officer Yates.
Requesting access to D Tower.
It's a punishment tower.
(METALLIC DOORS CLANKING)
It's becoming hotter and hotter.
There's, like, food on the ground and, you know, the smell is horrendous.
This paint is just terrible.
There's graffiti written all over the walls.
It was almost like the forgotten tower of Estrella Jail.
Has it always been like this?
Never been here, myself, so...
You never been here?
(SIGHS) Not to this part.
How long have you worked here?
Almost a year.
Male officer on the floor.
(WOMEN EXCLAIMING)
Boom, baby!
(POUNDING, INDISTINCT YELLING)
Open up!
(POUNDING, INDISTINCT YELLING)
Just screaming and yelling and just hysteria.
It was like a gladiator arena.
(LAUGHS) You can't run from us, baby!
Oh, we got a newbie.
Let me out!
Oh, you scared?
Let me out of this dang cell!
(INDISTINCT YELLING)
I was, uh... I was a little scared.
Come here!
You all right, man?
(INDISTINCT CRYING)
I'm gonna get you!
(BUZZER BLARING)
 we relieve the other officers on duty.
Hey, guys.
The officers seemed kind of stressed out.
They seemed exhausted.
How was your night?
How's it going, guys?
Officer Yates.
It's kind of awkward behavior, not something that I would definitely normally see, right?
You can see all corridors.
There's a few blind spots, but that's what we have cameras for.
They're everywhere.
Day or night.
(TELEVISION STATIC)
All right, I'll go do count first.
I volunteered to do count that night.
I really wanted to get an idea of, like, what the facility was like.
(RADIO STATIC AND CHATTER)
(BUZZER BLARES)
(LOUD THUD)
Count is the single most important thing that we do on our job, ever.
As long as those inmates are there where they're supposed to be, everything else doesn't matter.
(FAINT POUNDING)
And then I noticed something kind of strange.
Why is there a sergeant inside the house unit?
Part of me is thinking maybe I screwed up and did something wrong my... You know, my first day here.
Or maybe, um... maybe they're just coming to say hello.
Maybe?
I walked into the control room...
There was nobody in there.
Hey, where'd the Sergeant go?
What do you mean?
No one's come in since you've left.
I didn't know what he was talking about.
I could've sore I just saw...
Just me here.
I knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that there was a sergeant standing right behind him.
Think I just need some coffee or something.
Oh, yeah, we got some right here.
Security checks are done approximately every 25 minutes.
I'm gonna go do my count.
Okay.
It was 11:00, it was lights out.
Lights out, ladies.
Hit your bunks. 11:00 p.m.
(LIGHTS CLICKING OFF)
There's a certain kind of silence that's different inside of a jail.
Clink, clink, clink, clink... slam!
I noticed a door was open.
Well, that door shouldn't be open.
(DOOR CLANGING)
I'm thinking, "What is going on?"
This is Yates in D Tower.
(DOOR CLANKING)
I got a door opening and closing in hallway four.
They told me that the door was decommissioned, it doesn't work.
I assumed that it probably was just a maintenance issue.
Went back to doing, you know, my work.
And then I started hearing footsteps.
(FOOTSTEPS)
I assumed my partner had come back.
(FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE)
But couldn't see anything with my eyes down the hallway.
(FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE)
The footsteps stopped right at the door.
I'm figuring, I'm a new guy, maybe they're kind of hazing me a little bit, maybe it's kind of like a joke.
All right, guys, very funny.
You got me... You pranked the new guy.
(POUNDING)
(POUNDING)
There's nowhere they could have hid, there was nowhere they could have gone.
Maybe tomorrow night will be much easier.
Hey, you catch the Cardinals game last night?
It's part of our job as detention officers to be desensitized, to not show emotion.
But it's a whole 'nother level that was happening at this jail.
Yates, Simpson.
I got you two guys on D Tower tonight.
You got it.
That's three times this week.
Come on.
He was kind of talking to himself a little bit.
I can't do this, I can't do this.
I can't do this, I can't do...
He knows where I am.
He can see us.
I'm like, "Okay, this is kind of weird."
Hey, you okay, man?
No, I got to get out of here.
Get out of here?
I need to go.
You're not feeling well?
Here, I got a soda, you want it?
Hey, who is that?
And I'm like, "Okay, who the hell is that?"
I'm gonna go on my security check.
Suddenly, I heard...
But I don't want to! I don't want to.
I don't want to! (GIGGLES)
(CLATTERING)
Inmate.
I... no!
No!
(WOMAN CRYING)
Inmate.
No, no, no.
(RAT SQUEAKS)
What I saw wasn't natural.
That look, that stare, kind of perforated through my entire body.
He's here and he told me to kill myself.
She kept telling me that, "He was here, he was here."
Inmate, this is a secure facility.
The only officer on the floor is me.
No, no, no, no! (INMATES YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
Officer Yates to medical.
Jay called and said, "I need you down here, I need medical."
I need you to bring an inmate to medical.
She needs a psych evaluation.
(INMATES YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
Oh, baby!
Let me out.
He was here.
The Sergeant was here.
And he told me I got to kill myself.
That time of night, there was no reason for a sergeant to be in a cell block.
Is he still here?
He's right behind you.
Hey.
He was here.
The Sergeant was here and he told me I got to kill myself.
Is he still here?
He's right behind you.
But I knew that I had seen something on the monitors.
Who was that sergeant?
(GIGGLES) It's not gonna do anything!
It's gonna be okay. Yeah, I got her.
I got her. You're gonna be okay.
Just follow me.
I was worried about Jay every day.
 his life was in danger.
So every single day, it was a relief.
To have someone that's more than just your wife, I mean, for her to be your best friend...
So how did it go?
(CHUCKLES)
I'm exhausted.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Dad, can you see my report card?
Not today, buddy. Daddy's tired, okay?
Okay.
'Cause usually, he would spend time, um, with the boys.
My mind was just completely... just shot.
My body was shot.
And I'm thinking to myself, "I've got to get out of D Tower."
I can't do this job at this place every day with all that was going on.
(CLOCK TICKING)
(METALLIC DOOR OPENS)
Suddenly, I hear a slider door opening.
(METALLIC DOOR CLANKING)
All the inmates were asleep, they're inside their cells.
Didn't make any sense.
(SCREECHING)
But then I realized he wasn't in D Tower.
(SCREECHING CONTINUES)
Boom, like, right on my face out of nowhere.
Who just threw a chair at my tower?
This is Officer Yates.
Identify yourself.
Identify yourself!
These things that were happening, there was no logical explanation.
It was, like, nonstop.
It's early morning hours, everyone's asleep, everyone's completely out.
And I'm watching my partner conduct a security walk.
It was around 1:00 in the morning.
Every shift, we have to do three random cell searches.
I noticed two girls were awake.
Chill with the light, yo!
Stand up to be cuffed.
Got to perform a cell search.
Yo, seriously.
Hands out here, please.
Yates, performing a cell search on 1A4.
 Copy that.
All right, open the door, please.
Right there.
Don't move until I say.
I was exposed, I was relying on my partner to keep an eye on the inmates.
Yates, you have eyes on me?
I'm looking for contraband, whether it be weapons, drugs.
Suddenly, I felt like I wasn't by myself.
(EERIE MUSIC)
I'm searching the bottom bunk, and all of a sudden...
(SHOUTS)
But the inmates are sitting about 15, 20 feet away from me.
Did you move? Did you get up?
Did you just move? Did you touch me?
Did you grab me?
No.
Unless you want us to.
(LAUGHS)
I don't think the females that I pulled out could've done that.
If it wasn't the inmates, you know, what was it?
You want your mommy?
(CHUCKLES)
(BUZZER BLARING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Oh, I see now!
Arms off.
Come here!
Walking in my first day at Estrella was... you know, like the lost kid at the first day of school.
I recognized Officer Yates, and I was like, "Hey."
Remember me?
Padilla.
Hey.
He wasn't being the officer that I first knew him as.
What's going on? Long night?
 down.
It was weird to see, and it was out of place.
It's just something you don't normally see on him.
Okay, we have a new officer joining us today.
Officer Padilla, welcome aboard.
Uh, she will be working with Officer Yates at D Tower tonight.
D Tower just seemed neglected.
It's dark and it's dirty.
I've never seen a tower like that before in a jail.
I heard what I thought was a male voice.
Why am I hearing a male's voice?
Where the hell is this coming from?
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
All right, maybe it's from outside.
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
And I could still hear the voice.
I radioed Yates.
I hear a voice; I think there's someone down here.
She kept saying, you know,
"I'm hearing this male voice talking."
Okay, I'll just finish up and be right there.
Who is this and what do they want?
And then the voice stopped.
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)
And then, all of a sudden...
I saw a man.
Hello?
Sergeant?
Hello?
Hello?
The man had vanished from the corner.
It scared the crap out of me.
I saw something.
Someone.
I knew no other officer that could've been there.
All right, let's go back to the control room.
Another officer's presence would've been known there.
I'm like, "Okay, I'm not crazy.
She saw it, this is some real stuff going on."
Day by day, Jay was changing.
His attitude, his demeanor, and everything was completely changing.
I didn't know what to do.
And now over to Crystal, reporting live from Maricopa County.
Just a few hours ago, a detention officer from Estrella Jail was found unconscious here in his home.
Doctors believe it was an attempted suicide.
Paramedics did their best to revive Mr. Mark Simpson, and he is now in critical condition at a local hospital.
This is not the first time that a staff member from Estrella Jail has attempted to take their own life.
It felt like a ton of bricks hit my chest.
That is the same jail my husband's working at.
Later that night, I was back in D Tower.
It was time for the first security check of the night.
My partner was up in the control room.
I hear what sounds like a choking, like a... (WHEEZES).
I hear the noise again... (WHEEZES).
You know? Like this gasp of air.
I knew what that sound was.
That was the sound of someone hanging themselves.
(CHOKING CONTINUES)
There's nobody there.
She's literally hanging.
She was gone.
I just lost my grip, I just lost all...
I felt like I lost my sanity.
Hey, Yates.
I was worrying that he was going to, you know, maybe drive himself sick.
He was going to maybe take his own life.
Yates.
It was hard to see him go through this.
And I tried talking to him and, you know, he really kind of just brushed me off.
Said, you know, "Everything's fine."
 it was gonna take me to a place to where maybe I'd take my own self out.
You know? That's what I worried about.
Look into my rearview mirror... There was nobody there.
 I couldn't shake the thought that there's... There's someone following me.
Hey, kids?
Come on in, it's time to eat, okay?
Usually, we'd take the kids, load up, go hiking.
(DOOR SLAMS CLOSED)
Oh, good.
Oh, hey, Dad.
But Jay was like a zombie.
I mean, he didn't even look at me.
Jay.
At that moment, I was a little angry at him.
I told him, "Jay, get up, get in the shower, 
Come on, we're ready to go, right?
You excited?
I'm not going anywhere, I'm not doing anything, all right?
Jay.
Damn it, woman, give me a break.
What's wrong with you?
The kids and I were gonna spend the whole day with you.
Did I tell you to come in here, woman?
He was just treating me like I was just an inmate.
I had to do something to bring my husband back.
I couldn't live on this earth without him.
So that would be... the worst thing in the world.
A news story popped up.
In court today, in a case that has shocked this small Phoenix community, Maricopa County detention officer Dean Thomas has pleaded guilty to one charge of first degree murder for killing his wife in 2005.
I really didn't want anything to do with anybody.
I just wanted to be alone.
I wanted to be by myself.
All of a sudden, I heard the door.
Damn it, Marie, will you give me some space?
Marie!
I see this lady.
I had no idea who this woman was.
Hello?
And suddenly...
(SHRIEKS)
In court today, Maricopa County detention officer Dean Thomas has pleaded guilty to one charge of first degree murder...
I'm like, "Okay, this is really scary."
Was the same thing gonna happen to me?
Jay?
Jay?
Jay?
Jay?
Honey?
All the sudden, he turned his head.
And he looked at me, and goes...
I'm waiting for the inmates.
What?
I'm like, "Babe, wake up, you're not in the jail.
Wake up."
Please.
Jay, come on, honey. Please look at me.
Please, Jay, you've got to turn around, okay?
(GROWLS)
(SCREAMS)
It scared the living crap out of me.
But I wasn't gonna give up on him.
Jay.
Jay, look at me.
Come on!
Where are you? What's wrong with you?
Just talk to me. Please!
Marie?
Jay?
Held me for the first time for a very long time.
Like I was freezing cold for so long and then all the sudden, I had that warmth wrap around me.
Had I lost her, my mind would've been completely gone.
I wouldn't... would have never been normal again.
Honestly, today, I feel that there's still a part of me that's still in that jail.
A part that will never be released.
Do I ever think we was really a sergeant in real life?
Hell no, I don't think he was a real sergeant in real life.
I think it was just a demon in disguise.
