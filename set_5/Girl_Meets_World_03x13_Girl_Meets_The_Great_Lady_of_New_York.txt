The Statue of Liberty, the Great Lady of New York has been speaking loud and clear since 1885.
Anybody know what she's trying to say? Maya?
Should I just talk?
No, I'm sick of people thinking Farkle's smarter than I am.
Here comes fun.
Name one thing about the Statue of Liberty that you know that I don't.
She was a gift of friendship from...
Cathy.
We got her right after...
Cathy didn't want her anymore.
What does she stand for?
Because Cathy took her chair.
Boy, that Cathy, huh, what a hoot.
She's not real, genius. I made her up.
(Scoffs) I'm so smarter than you.
You are. You really are.
Welcome to Cultural Week, people.
The school is throwing a cultural fair to celebrate who we are and where we came from.
Anybody here taking part?
My grandma's gonna have a booth at the fair, Mr. Matthews.
That's great, Nigel.
What culture will you be celebrating?
She was originally from Cambodia, she escaped and lived in the Philippines, then she came here.
Did you know that about him?
It surprises me when any of these guys talk.
And that's exactly what makes America so unique.
We all come from exotic locales with fascinating traditions.
Well, where are we from?
Philly.
What's our fascinating tradition?
Cream cheese.
So I'm the great lady of cream cheese?
I want a better tradition, please.
Funny you should say that.
Funny, "haha" funny, or funny... (Groans) "yay" funny?
Here's your assignment.
(Students groan)
Yay!
Everybody look around.
Do we know each other's stories?
Do you know your own?
Our stories are what make us part of a community.
I want you to come in tomorrow and share your heritage with us.
Share your story.
Do I even have a story?
You have a wonderful story, Riley.
It's time you found out what it is.
(Theme music playing)
(Cuban jazz playing)
(Music stops)
(Music resumes)
Is that music always playing?
All of a sudden, I'm hearing the world differently.
So, they're that, what are we?
Hmm. What has your father done now that I must pay for?
We need to report on our cultural heritage.
Ooh, good idea.
Wish we had one.
We're not anything?
We are multi-generational American.
So I got no story? What about Auggie?
He's a rescue. He could be anything.
Honey, there's always a story. You just have to discover it.
Well, what's the story with dinner?
This looks different.
Maybe to us.
But I bet it makes Auggie's new friend from school feel right at home.
Where's he from?
He's from Cuba.
What's that?
It means "old clothes."
I don't want to eat old clo...
It's shredded beef, tomatoes and veggies, a very popular Cuban dish.
That's so nice of you, Mom, making Auggie's little friend feel more comfortable in a new, scary place.
(Cuban jazz resumes)
Hey, thanks a lot.
When you visit me, I'll play "Yankee Doodle."
Well, he doesn't actually seem scared.
This is my new best friend, Rafael.
Raffi's from Cuba.
Wow, something smells like ropa vieja.
Yay! That's a relief.
Very kind of you.
Thank you. Smells like home.
It's very good.
You know, I come from cream cheese.
I hope it was no trouble.
Oh, it was no trouble at all, Raffi.
Good. I wouldn't want anybody to go out of their way just to make me feel welcome.
(Cuban jazz resumes)
Too much?
Okay, here's my story.
Once upon a time... nothing. I'm completely American.
My people never even left the house.
I'm not even cream cheese.
I'm American cheese. I'm individually wrapped.
Here I come.
Oh, that's the worst report I ever heard.
Oh, you don't want one?
No, I do want one.
You made me this!
Great news, Maya.
Your report couldn't possibly be any worse.
You don't know me.
Turns out Clutterbucket is Irish!
I'm Irish.
Know why I'm a short stack of pancakes, Huckleberry?
'Cause I'm a leprechaun! Here have a potato!
That's what you brought? Potatoes?
No, that would be a stereotypical ignorant cliché.
I also brought our national soap.
Maya, Ireland has a rich, deep cultural history.
You show us something authentic right now!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna Riverdance all up on Yogi's head.
Do it!
Sit down!
Both of you have just squandered an opportunity to show us who you are.
Lucas, Zay, show us who you are.
You sure about this?
We look good.
Texas!
Texas!
Sit down.
You lied to me!
Don't mess with Texas.
You're not from Texas.
He lived right down the street from me.
You're not from Texas either.
He lived right down the street from me.
Sit down.
Okay, back to us.
(Playing off-key)
No!
Bagpipes are Scottish, not Irish.
Potato potato.
What a bunch of jerks.
Daddy?
Leave me alone!
Daddy?
No!
Daddy?
What?!
You gave me a stupid story, Daddy.
You all have great stories.
That's what makes this world such a peaceful place.
No, it's not. There's conflicts everywhere.
You mean cultures clash with each other?
Yeah. All through history.
Good boy, Lucas.
Good boy, Lucas.
Maya...
Maya!
There's conflicts 'cause we live in a world full of different kinds of people.
Right. Unfortunately, people have always feared the other.
The other what?
The unknown.
Anybody who isn't like you.
From a different country, a different religion, a different look.
And our first reaction to the unknown has always been fear.
Farkle.
Yes, sir?
Did you do the assignment?
I did, sir.
Did you find the story of your ancestors?
I found something out, sir.
Well, Farkle, at least you have a heritage.
I'm Riley McCheese. What could be worse than that?
There are worse things than that, Riley.
You ready to share something with us, Farkle?
Not yet, sir. I don't have it all yet. I need to dig deeper.
More to discover?
A lot more.
That's the only authentic thing that's been said today.
We all need to dig deeper than potatoes and soap and stupid hats.
How are they stupid hats?
They just don't understand us.
This is a week about discovering who you are.
This is a week to understand that culture isn't found at a souvenir shop.
Riley, what's culture?
Our stories.
Find yours.
Find yours.
Learn from each other.
Otherwise, we don't stand a chance.
So, Farkle, what's your big family mystery?
So, turns out I have a relative from Denmark.
Hey, you're a little Danish. Little danish?
I've found lots of Minkuses...
"Minki."
Living in Copenhagen, in Denmark.
The mystery is that I can't find my great-grandfather's birth records.
So?
So, he was the first one who left Denmark, came to America and started the American "Minki" team.
I want to find out more about him.
I want to know what made him come here.
Well, good luck, detective coffee cake.
Oh, he did? I didn't know that.
My grandmother's telling me a story about my grandfather.
I just find that terribly...
I am so sorry that I ate the cookie!
I know that you only made one for Zay and I ate it.
Please make him another one.
What?
This is your other grandmother.
I knew that.
She says that she doesn't like the cookie bribe, and you should love them both the same.
You need to calm her down right now.
Stay away from my grandmas, Riley.
Hey, that's a lot of words. Hey, gotta go.
Yeah, love you, too.
Yes, just as much as the other one.
No, I don't think that's okay to say, Grandma.
Thanks for telling me where I'm from.
We're from Africa!
Oh...
What?
Yeah. Feels good to do the research.
No, for real. I'm learning my story.
We started out in Ghana.
My grandma says we're lucky to know where we're from.
Not everyone does.
My family was brought from Ghana to Jamaica before we came to America.
We lived in Texas, and now we live in New York.
Now I'm friends with you.
Well, I look forward to seeing you every day.
Thanks, Maya. Happy to be here.
Well, Zay, my family comes from America, America, America, and then America.
And once, I went to the International House of Pancakes.
Hmm. What'd you eat?
I had a hamburger.
Hmm.
Mom, do you think it's important to know our history?
What's that you're eating?
Bulochki.
Is there a story behind it?
Well, it makes me think of Ms. Svorski.
That's why I will always sell them here.
It helps to remind us of those who came before us.
Riley, your family may have been from America for a long time, but we have lived in every part of America, and we've gotten to experience all kinds of different cultures.
Where? Who?
Well, your great-grandparents, they lived in San Francisco.
They got to experience the Chinese culture.
Your grandparents lived in Philly, and we used to go to Pennsylvania Dutch country.
Respect the people who came before you.
Always listen to what they have to say.
Mets, Phillies... who won the game?
We lost.
: We won!
Ava, you caught a foul ball?
It was coming at us like a rocket.
I saved his life.
Auggie?
Cory. Do what you did when the ball came at you.
(Shrieks)
Ava has quality I like.
You're kidding me?
She's just like my friend Marisol.
No. There is not another one like Ava out there.
God would not do that to us.
You like the game, Raffi?
Yeah, I met my cousin there.
Oh, where is he from?
Also Cuba.
Where is he now?
Left field.
Huh?
Your cousin is Yoenis Céspedes?
Your cousin plays for the Mets?
God bless America!
He signed my ball.
He also gave me his number... 52.
So, the Statue of Liberty is from France, we have a Ukrainian bakery, and the New York Mets are from all over the world.
Nice country you got here.
All right, guys, we got the whole joint scoped out.
Every country in the world, all over the school. Where do we go?
To the one with the most free stuff! Let's go, go, g...
No, we're all staying together, Maya.
Okay.
Oh, Cambodia.
Anybody interested in learning about a new culture?
Yeah, that's been on my mind lately.
Hi. My name is Riley and these are my friends.
What was Cambodia like for you?
Cambodia is a beautiful country.
I lived there in a very bad time.
Oh, um... Well, have a nice day.
What's your story?
Maya, you can't just ask.
We're supposed to hear stories.
Yes, it's okay.
I have a story. I haven't spoken of this for a long time.
We don't mean to intrude.
Not intruding if you really want to hear.
We do.
Please.
It's a very hard thing to decide you must leave your own country.
Can you guys even imagine that?
I can imagine it, Riley.
Farkle?
Why did you need to leave your country?
When I was little, my country was run by an evil man.
Very cruel. Millions imprisoned, tortured.
My family, many relatives, planned for months. Wait for right moment.
One night, we leave.
I was not even supposed to go.
They thought I would cry. Bring soldiers.
I only cried inside.
Went to Philippine Islands. Now here.
Not all of us make it out.
I'm sorry.
You live in a good country, you know that?
Hi, guys.
Hey, Nigel.
Grandma talking your ears off?
Oh, this is your grandma.
(Speaks Cambodian)
I didn't even know you could talk and you talk two languages.
I speak English, Cambodian, and Filipino.
Why would you want to do that?
So I can understand what everybody has to say.
You have very nice friends.
Thank you for taking the time to listen to an old woman.
I'm glad you made it here.
So am I.
Thank you for sharing your story.
I am in love with Ireland.
Not about potatoes and soap anymore, huh?
Nope. It's about how proud I am to be from there.
From the music to the poets.
I just never wanted to leave that booth.
Well, you and me will go to Ireland the next St. Paddy's Day.
We'll hang out with the Clutterbuckets.
Yeah. The booth was real easy to find, but where exactly is Ireland?
I think it's up and over there.
Okay, why are you being so quiet, Farkle?
It's making me really upset.
Really?
No.
Like it. Peaceful.
Yeah, talk, Farkle. This isn't like you.
I'm not really sure anymore what's like me.
What's the matter with you?
No, I get it.
It's just hard when you look at all of these booths to not picture yourself living a different type of life, right?
That's what you're talking about.
Okay.
Well, while all of you guys were at your booths of your countries, I went looking for the America booth.
Guess what? They don't have one.
(Bell rings)
We hope you learned something about somewhere else.
Arrivederci, sayonara, and for all you native New Yorkers... get outta here!
Last chance, Farkle.
You want to go find the Denmark booth?
Yeah, let's give Farkle a chance to hear some stories about his people.
No, that's okay. I think I know too many stories already.
I never knew much about the Clutterbucket side of my family.
My mom's Katy Clutterbucket because that's how she rolls.
We're from Galway, Ireland.
My relatives were fishermen, mostly.
And I've been looking up pictures of Ireland, and it's so beautiful.
So is my mother. So I'm going to take her there one day because we're part of it.
Because the best thing about being alive is to feel part of something.
So, thank you for making me find out.
Great work, Maya.
Thank you for sharing your story with us.
Riley?
I'm going with you.
Duh-hurr.
All through Culture Week I've been searching the school for the America booth.
And they don't have one.
And then I found something that made me understand why.
Field trip.
You don't need an America booth when you come from here.
This country is one big cultural fair.
Every day, I walk through different neighborhoods, different communities, and becoming a part of them is as easy as stopping by to say hello.
I am this girl right here.
We all are.
A combination of everybody we see every day.
Once upon a time, Riley Matthews lived in New York City, and because of that, she lives everywhere.
That's my story.
I have a story.
Thank you, Riley.
I'm sure the Great Lady of New York is smiling even bigger today.
I know she holds a torch for all of us.
Go on. Get out of here.
You know, Farkle, you're the only one who hasn't told us anything today.
Yeah. We know everyone's story but yours.
And that doesn't work in this group.
Farkle?
My great-grandfather left Denmark and came to America right after World War II.
Just him?
I think he was the only one left.
Well, what about the others before him?
I don't think they were named Minkus.
Well, who were they?
I don't know. I don't know if I'll ever know. There aren't birth records.
All I know is that during World War II, he was adopted by a Christian family named Minkus in Denmark who wanted to help him.
Help him what?
Help him live.
His great-grandfather was Jewish.
Sometimes it's real hard when you find out your story.
My whole family...
Yeah.
I'm here if you ever want to talk.
Me, too.
I found out about these wonderful people called "Christian Rescuers."
They saved babies by taking them in when they were...
Thanks.
I'm glad you found your story, Riley.
I'm happy you all did.
My story will be about how lucky we are to live in a place that allows you to come here so you can be whoever you are.
But that's all I can really tell you about my heritage right now.
Because I'm still finding out who I am.
(Bell rings)
We must have walked all over New York.
My doggies are barking.
Rub my feets.
Yes, darling.
First let me get my feet rubbing equipment.
Marisol makes me do the same thing!
Oh, no, trust me, there is nobody else in the world like Ava.
(Skype ringing)
Oh, yeah?
Marisol, I want you to meet my new friends.
One's a little like you.
Hey, I'm the one who says stuff like that!
Because I'm...
♪ Ava Morgen... stern ♪

♪ Yeah! ♪
♪ Marisol Santo Domingo De La Cruz, sí! ♪
Kill me right now.
No?
Okay.
Honey... get to work.
Deede-deedle-dee, deede-deedle-dee.
Deede-deedle-dee, deede-deedle-dee.
Ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba... (All scatting)
