This was our forever home.
What is that?
Looks kind of human, right?
Why won't you listen to me?
Her behavior became dangerous.
(CRASHING)
I'm not alone in here.
(CLATTERING)
(SCREAMING)
Help me!
(DOG BARKING)
It was like something out of my worst nightmares.
Ah!
(CRASH)
(GROWLING)
I couldn't believe what I found.
(SNARLS)
(BELL DINGING)
The family and I were always on the road.
We always were moving.
 a position that required a lot of traveling.
We have two daughters, Bri and Andi.
Moving around constantly, that was difficult for the girls.
I think I've lived in nine different states and one Canadian province at least twice.
There was a tent once.
So we were always kind of looking for that place where we were gonna say, this is it.
We're gonna buy real furniture.
This is home.
We found this perfect 10-acre plot.
It was a small ranch.
I just went, "Wow, this is it."
I was instantly in love.
It was like, you know, "This is so cool."
It's in the middle of nowhere, Mom.
And I don't even want to think about what's living in those fields.
 and we'd never lived in a place that far away from a town before.
So that kind of made me nervous.
Once we actually got into the house, 
 to bring it up to the standard that we had hoped for.
I didn't like the inside at all.
Look, it's all gonna change.
We thought, you know, we'll brighten it up.
A little bit of modification is gonna go a long way.
So the carpets were the first thing that had to go.
 the girls and I were rolling the carpet up.
What is that?
And we started to see there was, like, something painted on the floor.
It wasn't just one or two of them.
They were, like, all over the floor.
Horses, eagles, 
Almost like hieroglyphics.
They must be really old.
Okay, let's not get carried away here.
Let's get back to work, come on.
So we just sort of brushed it off.
Sit.
Bagel!
Come here, sit.
Itchy and Bagel.
Sit.
Good.
Over and through, over and through.
Yes, Itchy!
(LAUGHTER)
Oh, that's so good.
What is it, Itchy?
We kind of saw something sticking out from under one of the bushes nearby.
Oh.
Oh, don't touch it.
Mom?
Mom, get over here.
You have to see this.
Where did you get that?
 and I thought, "Oh, my god, it's human."
Looks kind of human, right?
No.
I didn't want to scare her, and so I was like, "Oh..."
There's no way that's human.
It's probably a raccoon or a skunk or something.
That's a raccoon bone?
Yeah.
I'm sure it's some kind of animal.
We'll give it a burial.
Let's treat it with respect, whether it's a skunk, whether it's a raccoon.
Go get your dad's shovel, will you Breezy?
 how many other bones are we're gonna find?
What did we just stumble into?
(PHONE RINGING)
(RINGING CONTINUES)
Hello?
Hey, how are you?
Todd's mom and I were always very close.
She was one of my best friends.
Oh, god.
That's horrible news.
 she was hearing some distressing news.
Yes, he's coming over.
Hi, Mom.
I knew something really horrible had happened.
She had been diagnosed with advanced stage IV lung cancer.
We decided it would be a good idea to have her come stay with us for a few months, and we'd hope for the best.
You made it.
Take more than a little road trip to put me in my grave.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, Mom.
You love this painting.
Are you sure?
Oh, I'm fine with it, honey.
I want you to have it.
So we decided to give it a place of honor, 
So it would be one of the very first things that people saw when they walked in.
Yeah, it's beautiful, isn't it?
Gaye loved to smoke.
She would not stop smoking.
She would rather die than quit.
(GAYE HUMMING HAPPILY)
♪ There's a yellow rose in Texas... ♪
Humming that old folk song "The Yellow Rose of Texas."
(GAYE SINGING SOFTLY)
(GAYE SINGING SOFTLY)
One afternoon, I was just kind of puttering around the house, 
(GAYE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
Don't tell me to go to Miami.
It's not gonna work.
At first, I thought, oh, she must be on the phone.
I am not going anywhere.
Mr. Warren, please.
Please listen to me.
Can't you hear what I'm saying?
So I poked my head in her bedroom, and I could see there was no phone.
Gaye, who are you talking to?
Mr. Warren.
I'm looking around the room, and it's completely empty except Gaye, and I said...
Who's Mr. Warren?
He's my friend, of course.
See, these are my family.
This is their home.
I thought it was very odd that she was having this detailed conversation with nobody.
But I kind of brush it off as being part of the illness.
They won't like it.
And I guarantee I will not allow it.
No, I'm not going anywhere.
Please, stop, no!
Who is this Mr. Warren?
What is he asking her to do that she doesn't want to do.
Who are you talking to?
Who is Mr. Warren?
Gaye, who is Mr. Warren?
She just got up, walked past me, and went to bed.
(EERIE MUSIC)
That night, Todd and the girls had gone out for the evening.
So I decided I'd take a shower.
(EERIE MUSIC)
There was somebody at the sink.
And I thought, well, Todd and the girls must have come back for something.
So I yell out to him...
Todd?
Could you please hand me a towel?
He doesn't say anything.
He's just watching me.
Todd?
Come on, stop messing around.
Give me a towel.
This is really weird.
Todd?
What if it's not Todd?
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)
Nobody was there. .
Who was in the bathroom?
Why did I see somebody?
(SLOW CREAKING NOISE)
(WATER WHOOSHING)
There was something wrong.
(WATER RUNNING)
Hey?
Did you guys come home?
I'm starting to get a little scared.
(WATER RUNNING)
(WATER RUNNING)
Hello?
It felt like someone was leading me, room by room, through the house.
(WATER RUNNING)
(WATER STOPS)
(TELEVISION BUZZING)
(WATER WHOOSHES)
The house was coming alive with me inside of it.
(TELEVISION BLARING)
Bam, the TV, full blast.
There was something really, really wrong in our house.
Over the next few week's, Gaye's personality seemed to start to change.
Grams, do you want to see Itchy's new trick?
Gaye?
The girls are talking to you.
Why won't you listen to me?
I told you to get out.
Now get out!
Mr. Warren, don't you touch me.
Get away from me!
Her behavior became dangerous.
(CRYING)
She was changing.
 that we were no longer able to care for her, and we really needed to get her in a hospice situation.
We were concerned about her health.
 suddenly just kind of become this entirely different person.
There was a rose blooming on this bush that was red.
Rosebushes don't change colors.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
Yes.
We got a call to let us know that Gay had passed away.
We let the girls know that Gaye had passed away.
Do you smell that?
Cigarettes.
We were just overwhelmed with this smell of cigarette smoke.
Look.
And there was this gray cloud of smoke kind of wafting over the breakfast table.
 because this was the exact moment that we were having a conversation about my grandma and her passing.
Maybe she's saying good-bye.
(CRASHING)
The picture of the elk exploded.
(CRASHING)
What on earth is going on?
.
And I was kind of replaying the events of that whole day.
At first, I felt like perhaps Gaye was still with us.
Gaye was trying to tell us something.
 there was something much deeper going on.
 that was attached to the house through a hallway.
(LIGHT CLANGING)
(LIGHT CLANGING CONTINUES)
There's something in the garage.
(LIGHT SWITCH CLICKING)
It didn't work at all.
I kind of started to get a really weird feeling.
It almost felt like I was in a place I shouldn't be.
Well, the walls of the garage were just covered in these long scratches.
These scratches went up the wall, higher than I was tall.
The scratches were wider than my hand was.
What on earth could have done this?
Hey.
What are you doing in here?
Have you seen these scratches?
They're huge.
This is probably where the last family kept their dogs.
Dog?
Right, you know what they say.
Everything's bigger in Texas, right?
He tells me it's okay, so it's okay.
 what was in here?
 I was running some errands around the house, 
It was always kind of a strange atmosphere.
(DOOR SLAMS)
All of a sudden, bam, the door slammed shut.
Must have been, like, a draft.
(JIGGLING DOOR)
 but there shouldn't have been a lock on it.
Todd?
Todd, I'm locked in the garage.
(CLATTERING)
(CLATTERING)
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
I started to get a little panicky.
Somebody?
Andi.
I could see Andi through the window.
Andi, I'm locked in the garage.
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
We'd been, you know, at it for a couple of hours.
Andi!
Andi, listen to me!
Help me, I'm locked in the garage!
She couldn't hear me.
She couldn't see me.
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
Andi?
(GROWLING)
I'm not alone in here.
(GROWLING CONTINUES)
(SCREAMING)
Help me!
Help me, somebody, please!
(CLATTERING)
The paint can came flying across the room at me.
Please, help!
(SCREAMING)
Help me!
(SCREAMING)
Andi!
I went to open the door.
(PANTING)
It just opened for me, no problem.
I said, "Why didn't you let me out?
"What are you doing that you guys are so distracted you don't hear me yelling and screaming and banging?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't hear a thing.
We'd been right in the next room, doing schoolwork.
There was someone in there.
There was something watching me.
I couldn't see anything that was in there.
I decided this is the perfect opportunity to paint.
There was someone out there.
But I automatically assume it's Todd.
I mean, it's not gonna be anybody else.
Honey, have you seen my wallet?
All of a sudden, this guy disappears into the barn.
Todd, come up here.
I said, "Todd, we've got a prowler."
I just saw him walk into the barn.
A prowler?
Are you sure?
Yes.
You need to go take a look.
I saw that guy walk in there.
I am sure of it.
Being the dutiful husband I needed to be, I grabbed the big flashlight and the baseball bat 
(DOGS BARKING)
(DOGS WHINING)
(DOGS BARKING)
(DOG WHINING)
There's nobody in here.
Come on, it's okay.
Good boys.
(DOG WHINING)
It's okay.
Okay, Bagel, come on.
It's okay.
(DOG WHINING)
I waited, and he didn't come right out.
I'm waiting, and I'm waiting.
 because I don't have any idea what's going on.
Todd walked around the corner.
I breathed a sigh of relief.
Maybe I was getting tired.
(SNARLING)
(SNARLS)
(SHUDDERING)
Oh, god.
It was a grotesque face.
It looked like a Native American warrior.
But I knew, it can't possibly be human.
(DOOR BANGS OPEN)
(SHUDDERING)
Todd...
There was... there was something at the window.
His face, it was painted.
Honey, I was just outside.
There's nothing out there.
I searched everywhere.
There was no one there.
I was just nose-to-nose with this thing.
Okay, honey, it's late.
You're tired.
Maybe you saw your own reflection.
I'm telling you, I know what I saw!
It wasn't my reflection.
I don't have long black hair.
I don't have beady eyes.
She wanted to just understand what was happening, and I couldn't explain it.
Am I imagining things, or are we being haunted by Native American spirits?
Bri and I had been out all day, kind of running errands, and we had left Itchy and Bagel in the barn.
Bagel?
Itchy?
There was no sound.
Andi.
And as we looked closer, I saw that it was blood.
All of a sudden...
Mom, Dad!
(DOG WHINING)
They looked like they had been dumped in buckets of blood.
(DOGS WHINING)
They're our friends, and here they've torn each other apart.
They've never fought in their lives.
(DOGS WHINING)
They didn't do this to each other.
There is something evil.
There is something really dark in our house.
I wanted to learn as much as I could about the Native American culture.
I'm just going into town for a bit.
I won't be long.
I took a trip to the town library.
I needed to find out more.
 put the dogs in the house, 
 so that we could put it in the barn, where we like to keep it.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
At the library, I started to really dig in and do some research.
(EERIE MUSIC)
Suddenly, I got this sense that there was somebody behind me.
Breezy?
 of bloody conflicts all over this area 
I read that, before going into battle, the tribes would often smoke tobacco in a war pipe.
(SMOKE WHOOSHING)
(SMOKE WHOOSHING)
The TV, the pictograms.
I got the real sense that somehow this was connected.
I got this really uneasy feeling that something was watching me.
Something didn't want me there.
Breezy?
(GROWLING)
I was just like deer in the headlights.
(SNARLING)
What had we done?
Why were we being haunted by Native Americans?
I'm not going anywhere.
Please, stop, no!
What if Mr. Warren was real?
Why won't you listen to me?
I told you to get out!
I typed in, "Mr. Warren and Native Americans"...
And hit enter.
I couldn't believe what I found.
(GROWLING)
Bri, we got to go, there's a stranger in the barn.
What?
Just go, drive, drive!
Okay, okay!
She just hit the gas, and we took off.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(SNARLING)
Bri.
What?
Please.
Suddenly, this dark figure is just, like, coming out of the mist.
What are we gonna do?
Oh, my god.
(SNARLING)
It was a major supply route between San Francisco and St. Louis during the 19th century.
It passed right through where our ranch stood.
I read that in 1871 the wagon train was attacked by local tribesmen.
(MEN SHOUTING WAR CRIES)
(MEN SHOUTING WAR CRIES)
It all started to make perfect sense.
It all started to come together.
Looks kind of human, right?
(MEN SHOUTING WAR CRIES)
 in the middle of a reenactment of the Warren Wagon Train Massacre.
(ENGINE REVVING)
Bri and I just kept going.
Bri, there's another one.
He's coming out over there.
There's four!
I'm going as fast as I can!
It was like something out of my worst nightmares.
Go faster, please, go faster.
I can't go any faster!
Wait, I think... I think they're gone.
They eventually just vanished.
Ah!
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(CRASH)
What is it? What happened?
I hit someone, I hit a man.
You didn't see him?
What are you talking about?
Bri was convinced that there was someone there, that she had hit someone.
Let's just go.
No, there was somebody in the road.
I hit someone.
There was nobody in front of you.
They are behind us.
We have to go.
(ENGINE GRINDING)
It didn't work at all.
(ENGINE GRINDING)
Come on, come on.
Let me try.
(ENGINE GRINDING)
Nothing.
I found one website that sent a shiver down my spine.
 to channel the spirit of animals.
(SNARLING)
This explains everything.
At that point, I had this terrible feeling that something was going to happen to the girls.
(ENGINE GRINDING)
(HOWLING)
What was that?
(HOWLING CONTINUES)
We've got to get out of here.
(HOWLING)
I was panicked.
(PHONE BEEPING)
I could feel there was something wrong.
(BEEPING CONTINUES)
(GIRLS SCREAMING)
(SNARLING)
(GIRLS SCREAMING)
There was a sense of danger.
(SNARLING)
(PHONE BEEPING)
(TIRES SCREECH)
(SNARLING).
(GIRLS SCREAMING)
Ah!
(TIRES SCREECH)
They exploded out.
Guys, what's going on?
They were both hysterical.
Tell me what happened.
When I heard what happened, I couldn't believe my ears.
Like what?
Like animals.
We couldn't take it anymore.
We had to get out.
We could not live in this house anymore.
Nobody felt safe.
But the tension was so great, that we had to get out.
(ENGINE STARTS)
We were caught up in circumstances that were extraordinary.
