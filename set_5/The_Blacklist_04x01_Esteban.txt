He worked for a man who abducted someone I care about.
He's a cop.
Who's his rabbi?
I don't know, but I know who might.
Is it true? She's alive?
Apparently.
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
How is that... there were complications during labor.
And the doctor, he declared her dead.
He lied.
But there was a funeral. I-I was a pallbearer.
Yes, and who knows what was in that casket?
It was a charade, Aram.
So Agent Keen is alive?
Uh, but her funeral and her death...
She faked her death. Why would she do that?
To get away from Reddington.
So that her and Tom and Agnes could have a normal life.
Away from us?
Yes, after everything we did for her.
Best we could tell, Liz and Tom's plan was to go into hiding in Cuba.
Alexander Kirk found them.
Why? What does he want with Agent Keen?
Look, all we know right now is that when Reddington got there, Liz and Tom were gone.
I just got off the phone with the embassy in Havana.
Briefed them on Kirk, gave them the tail number to his plane.
If that was how he was planning to get off the island, that's not gonna happen.
And, uh, what about Agnes?
At this point, we don't know.

Elizabeth Keen is alive.
