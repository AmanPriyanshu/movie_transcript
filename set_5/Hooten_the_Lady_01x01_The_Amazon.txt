 historical monuments throughout the Middle East, priceless artefacts are being traded on the black market by thieves and opportunists.
And... we face similar challenges all over the world.
As we sit here, a vaste swathe of Amazonian rain forest first charted by Victorian explorer, Percy Fawcett, is being destroyed.
Fawcett was a visionary, and, with the recent discovery of the lost Urutu tribe, we have a real opportunity to find Fawcett's last known camp.
And yet, all you having me do, is sit behind a desk, and... fill out budgets, and-and viability studies...
Yeah, I-I think... what Alex's trying to say...
What I'm saying is... is Fawcett, Carter, Livingstone, Mary Kingsley, these were not people who sat behind desks.
They went out into the world, and they found what they were looking for.
Let me go out there... and try to emulate these men and women.
