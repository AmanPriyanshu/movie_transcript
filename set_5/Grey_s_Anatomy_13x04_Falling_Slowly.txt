Does it count if she wakes just as we're putting her back down?
"We"? What, you
 April?
No, you guys... You have to switch off, take turns.
Yeah, I know. We are, totally.
I mean, kind of.
It's just, you know, she's recovering from surgery, so every time it's her turn, I still get up and see how she's doing, which makes her feel guilty, so then she tries to come and help when it's my turn, and I spend that entire time trying to convince her that she needs to get rested up for... for her turn.
Which you then get up for, too.
(Yawning) It's not a perfect system.

This is second Thursday. Vaccination day.
We're about to get flooded by hundreds of patients needing shots on top of everyone else.
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.
What's important is our patients.
They can't be rescheduled like elective surgeries.
They need you here and so do I. The answer's no.

Oh, well, if you're going...
You want to go? I don't have to go.
No, you... you're already going.
Why would I go?
'Cause you were going.
Well, I'm not, though, if you are.
So I'll go.
And I will not go.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Okay.
I want to see my husband.
Try and hold still for me.
Is Daniel hurt? Can... Can you at least tell me that?
He's in the other room getting checked out.
There's some fluid in the belly.
We're gonna need a C.T. to take a better look.
Was your husband flying the glider?
It was his first time up there without an instructor, and he wanted me to go. (Inhales sharply)
He worked so hard for his. (Inhales sharply)

That is one infected abscess.
We're gonna have to open that up.
What are you doing?
My patient needs an I&D for his abscess.
Yeah, not by you. Page surgery.
I am surgery.
No, not in here you're not. You do not lance, you do not drain, you do not cut.
Look, it'll take five minutes.
You are not authorized to use a scalpel on anyone.
Page surgery.
I thought you said you

I wanted to let you know that the internal reports have been completed and filed.
Copies will be mailed to you, and all your records have gone to the D.A.
Okay. Thanks.
Uh, one more thing.
While the legal proceedings are still ongoing, you are not to discuss this matter within the walls of this hospital.
Don't talk about it to anyone.

Yeah, I understand.
You know, it won't be hard not to talk about it 'cause no one talks to me much now anyways, so...

See, you knew that.
But your dad died, too, and I have no idea when or how.
It hasn't come up.
Well, don't you think it should have?
Or maybe we didn't give it enough time to.
We gave ourselves a two-week engagement.

Hey, sorry.

No.
Was that a secret?
No, no.
It's just she's worried about stuff she doesn't need to be worried about.
Makes it a little more difficult than it needs to be, right?
Yeah, it's worth it, though.
Definitely.
Scans up?
Nope. Just started.
Oh, you're back. I didn't know you were here.
I'm not back.
I'm here early for my appointment with Dr. Robbins.
Six hours early.
Baby's in the nursery, so I'm here to finally sleep.
Dibs on bottom bunk.
Don't you have a bed of your own at home?
Not my home.
I can't day nap there 'cause it's cleaning day, and people are vacuuming and polishing.
It would feel rude.
You're making very little sense.
You know that thing they say about how you're supposed to sleep when the baby sleeps?
That's a lie!
Babies don't sleep.
I'd like to sleep.
At least my baby doesn't.
Except when she does sleep, then I don't sleep.
You know why?
'Cause you keep talking to her.
Because I am a guest in Jackson's house.
And Kepners are perfect guests, and being a perfect guest... is a hard job.
Listen, Dr. Kepner, I empathize, I really do, but I just spent 16 hours straight removing a meningioma and clipping something like a million back-to-back aneurysms.
And I'm back on Dr. Shepherd's service in a couple of hours, so I need my sleep, too, so I could go cut into actual human brains, so...

You got to be kidding me.

Well, am I dying?
No.

Good news, Earl. Looks like you just had beets for dinner.
You're having a natural reaction called beeturia.

Oh, I'm feeling amazing. I'm feeling perfect.
Got it all together.

Headache, nausea, chills, the spins...
I.V. bag.
All right, vitals first then I decide what to give you, okay?
Oh, ew. You're new.
Put the I.V. in the left arm.
It's where the good veins are.
Start with a liter of saline and push it hard.
I'm dehydrated.
And do me a favor.
If you're an intern or, like, dumb, get help, because last time, I was poked about 100 times and my arm was purple for weeks.
That's good to know.
How are the scans?
Well, it looks like a grade-3 splenic injury.
How's the husband?
He's worried about her.
Mm. I'm gonna take her up for an ex lap.
For that? There's no reason. There's no active bleeding.
Well, I thought that, too, but look.
There's stranding and fullness around the aorta.
If we go in for the spleen, then we get to have a better look when we're there.
Right, but there's no clinical reason for surgery.
Well, there is if we find out that her aorta is in trouble.
If. That's my point. We should wait and see.
I can see what you mean, Hunt, but Grey's right.
I mean, the patient is stable.
Observation just makes more sense right now.
We do a repeat C.T. angio in a few hours...
Oh, waiting is definitely the safer choice.
Well, I disagree.
Oh, so that's it, then?

(Sighs)
So, this means it's real.
I'm not overreacting. I'm not crazy.
Definitely not.
Thank you, Dr. Weber.
(Sniffles)
There's no way that other asshat doctor would've figured this out.
That's why the clinic's here, Emma.
We're just happy to help.

Thank you.

While we were in there, you had a sudden dissection in your aorta, which, um, well, I'm glad we caught it in time.
How you feeling?
I don't know.
I... I guess, like... like I fell out of the sky in a plane I never wanted to be in.
Don't tell Danny I said that.
No.
He'll feel so bad. I know him.
He's eating himself alive over this.
Can I see him?
Yeah. I'll find him for you.
Oh, one more thing that's kind of strange.
I can't feel my legs yet.
When is this anesthesia gonna wear off?
What?
So, when the aorta dissected, it compromised the feeder vessels to the spinal cord right around L-4.
And it damaged the cord there.
So, she's paralyzed from the waist down?
And it's irreversible.
If we'd been in there sooner...
It wouldn't have made a difference.
Yes, if we had gone in...
Owen, it wouldn't have made a difference!
It dissected right in front of us!
I couldn't have foreseen that and neither could you.
This happens.
It's happened to me before.
Okay? It's unfortunate, but it does.
You couldn't have saved this.
I'll go tell her.
That's the truth, right?
What?
That we couldn't have seen this coming.
That's true?
Why would you ask me that?
Because I need to make sure that our decision to wait didn't put this woman in a wheelchair.
No, it didn't.
You didn't... side with me because of... you and I?
Excuse me?
Because we decided to wait, this falls on us.
Whoa, whoa.
If you think I would play around with a patient's well-being in order to get into your pants?
That's not what I'm saying. I'm asking a question.
It's a damned offensive question!
Did we make the right decision for the right reason?
I agreed with you because you were right, not because you were you.
Now, what happened to Polly is not to your fault.
And it's certainly not mine. I'm not that stupid!

You heading home?
I'm not sure I'm at liberty to disclose that information at this time.
Right.
Wouldn't be prudent at this juncture.

Your whereabouts should remain need-to-know.
Mm.
Look, if you can't talk to anyone and I can't talk to anyone, no one's gonna know if we talk to each other, right?
True, yeah.
You hungry?

So, Dr. Hunt says that she's still groggy and trying to process everything, but she wants to see you.
I can't go in there.
I can't. I-I'm the one who did this to her.
She's in the bed because of me.
I can't face her. I can't go in.
You have to.
You're the only one she needs right now.
She was on the plane because of me.
And now she's off and she's alive.
Your wife is alive.
And if there's anyone who could tell her this isn't the end, that this isn't the worst thing that could've happened, it's you.
Because this isn't the worst thing.
She's still breathing.
She needs you right now.
She needs you to be strong and pull it together for her.
Daniel, she's ready for you.
But what... what do I say?
You guys love each other.
You can say anything.

Shouldn't she be in a crib or something?

You should be happy she's sleeping at all.
Well, I mean, I was hoping we could talk.
Um, I just feel like if I stop doing this, she's, like, gonna wake up.
Okay. Totally fine. It can wait.

Agreed. It's hard. I don't like it.
I don't either.

Well, Arizona says that I can.
I mean, I'm... I'm healed, so...
I will, like, I guess.
I mean, does that mean, like, right away, or what do you...
As soon as makes sense.
Right.
Well, uh...

She just slept right through that.
Yeah, she can be, um... pretty quiet when she wants to be.

I don't want you to move out.
I don't want to move out, either.

There was this man I loved very much.
And we loved taking drugs together, and one night we took a lot.
And... the next morning I woke up, and he had O.D.'d and aspirated on his vomit and... died.
