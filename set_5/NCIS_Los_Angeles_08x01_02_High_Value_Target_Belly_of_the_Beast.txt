Everyone has one.
I don't.
Either you do and you don't realize it, or you're just not being honest with me or yourself.
Why would I say I don't if I do?
Maybe there's something really personal on it.
Something you're embarrassed to admit.
Such as?
(sighs) I don't know; it's your list.
What are you guys talking about?
He won't tell me what's on his bucket list.
Because there isn't a list.
Everyone has a bucket list.
Do you?
Yes.
I want to get married.
I want to have kids.
I want to own a horse.
I want to live in Bali.
I want to read all the greatest books on the earth on a deserted island and ride my horse on the beach all day.
Those are just things to do.
That's the exact point.
It's a list of things you want to do before you die.
Okay, now, that's just morbid.
It's not morbid.
It's the exact opposite of morbid.
It's life-affirming. It's saying these are the things I want to accomplish while I'm still here.
Exactly.
There's got to be something you really want to do.
You mean, besides end this conversation?
(chuckles)
: "Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. (sniffs) He hath borne me on his back a thousand times, and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is!"
I want to do Shakespeare in the park for my bucket list, so...
You're all invited.
Don't worry.
Yay.
Can we put things on the list we don't want to do?
Hey, Beale.
What's, uh... what's going on here?
Oh, uh, 
Act Five, Scene One.
(chuckles) Care to be my Ophelia, my lady?
Mmm, not now.
Is it...? Okay.
Uh, a shipping container set off radiation detection equipment at LAX.
Something coming in?
Going out.
Homeland Security's on it, but they want all federal law enforcement agencies up to speed and requested us specifically.
Okay. Where's Deeks?
Dead in a ditch somewhere... or at a Denny's.
I don't know.
He got up early to go train for a triathlon or something.
It's probably on his bucket list.
Not unless it's sponsored by Hooters.
(clears throat) Relax.
We'll take this.
Great. Radiation's bad for my skin anyway.
You got a death wish, homes?
Easy, Dirty Harry Winston.
(laughing): Dude!
I almost blew your head off.
Yeah, thank you for not doing that.
Do you have a concealed carry permit for that thing?
None of your business.
No, actually, it is my business, 'cause I'm a cop, and you know that.
All right, we can just act like I didn't just ask that question; that's fine.
Hmm?
Mm-hmm.
Wow. That's... that's beautiful.
You know how much that would cost retail?
Yeah. I know exactly what it would cost retail: two months salary.
Yeah, maybe... if you were playing for the Clippers.
This is a steal.
You are literally stealing this from me.
I should be calling the cops.
Again, I'm a cop.
Promise me you'll get this insured.
Wait a minute. Is this... is this a blood diamond?
That hurts, Deeks; that hurts.
This is real and pure, like the light within.
I mean, just look at how it sparkles, forged in the ancient fires of the earth.
Okay. You sound like an infomercial.
So we good here?
Yeah, yeah, no.
We're definitely good, as long as you stay away from those, uh, police horses, right?
(chuckles) Of course, of course.
That was just, uh...
Dangerous?
It was stupid, super creepy.
Mazel tov!
Keep your pants on!
All right.
NCIS.
What do we got, Captain?
Sensors got a hot reading when they were loading this container.
Where was it headed?
Larnaca International.
Cyprus.
Yeah.
Supposed to be carrying refugee relief items.
Has anyone alerted the news media?
Not yet.
Let's keep it that way.
(beeping)
(device continues beeping)
That's some strong saline.
Any word from Callen and Sam?
No. Not yet.
(phone rings)
Ah...
Yes. Hello.
Well, well, well, it has been a very long time, A.J.
Uh, to what do I owe this...
Uh-huh.
Right.
Thank you for the heads-up.
Perhaps a little bit more lead time in the future.
Thanks.
We're getting a visit from the Under Secretary of Defense Duggan.
Why?
We'll have to ask him.
Well, when is he getting here?
He already is.
This can't be good.
Nope.
Assistant Director Owen Granger and Operations Manager Henrietta Lange.
Under Secretary.
We were not told you were coming.
To do so would have defeated my purpose.
Aha.
And what is that exactly?
I'm heading up a Joint Task Force with the Office of Special Investigations, and Intelligence and Security Command.
This station has been compromised.
We are here to fix that.
And what measures do you expect to employ that we haven't implemented already?
Well, to start with, we're replacing you and your staff.
Where have you been?
Oh. Uh, I just...
I got a sliver, so I was digging out the... hmm.
I was blowing up your phone.
Why? What's going on?
Because we're getting fired.
(exhales)
I'm not that late.
This whole unit's getting shut down. Let's go.
What? Are you kidding?
Wait, are you kidding?
: 
 this facility and the staff has been compromised.
Now, most of you had nothing to do with that, but you have all been affected by it.
Unfortunately, the breach was never adequately resolved to Washington's satisfaction, so we have been brought in to do so.
This task force has been working for months behind the scenes and is here now to resolve this once and for all.
All open cases will be brought current, assigned, and handed off to one of the task force members.
You will begin this process immediately.
Now, don't worry, after your interviews and your polygraphs, most of you will keep your jobs, (computer beeps) but it just probably won't be here.
I realize this is a lot to process, so we're going to try and make this transition as quick and painless as possible.
It's obviously going to take a few days to complete the handover, during which time I ask for your continued cooperation and patience.
Thank you.
(agents sighing, muttering)
: I feel like we're being punked.
How is SECNAV allowing this?
I don't know why she would, if she had a choice.
Please tell me you have a plan.
Actually... I do.
It's called retirement.
Just keep working until I can figure out what the hell is going on.
: The radioactive material has been identified as Cesium 137 Chloride.
It's colorless in crystal form, white when powdered, and water soluble.
Hold on a second.
(stammers)
Is this guy for real?
: Deeks, focus.
Our jobs can wait.
This can't.
No, I'm definitely focused on the Selenium 130 Chlorine.
: Deeks.
Yeah.
Cesium 137 Chloride.
Yeah-- no.
I got that.
I was just making sure you were listening.
It's the same material that was used in the Goiania accident in Brazil.
Thieves stole hospital equipment hoping to sell it for scraps.
Turned out some of it was radioactive material.
That's right.
It glowed blue.
They thought it was cool.
Passed it around to some friends.
Several people died as a result.
: Why was it in the saline?
Perhaps it's their attempt to get it past customs.
It gets to the destination, they boil off the saline, and they're left with the radioactive powder.
Oh, boom. Who's listening now?
So, one hospital and two medical labs within 200 miles of here have had their blood irradiation machines stolen in the last six weeks.
And we're just finding this out now because...?
Well, the machines themselves are worth tens of thousands of dollars.
I doubt anyone thought their stolen machine was part of a trend.
Until now.
How much cesium are we talking?
Well, enough to make several radiological dispersal devices.
I mean, dirty bombs themselves can be lethal, but their main purpose is as a terror device.
If detonated, they could shut down an area for months, if not years, for adequate decontamination and cleanup.
Well, not to mention trying to convince people that it's safe afterwards.
Unfortunately, because of its water-soluble nature, it could be used to contaminate city water supplies.
Oh, one more fun fact.
Cyprus is not its final destination.
From there, it was scheduled to be boarded onto a ship bound for the Port of Latakia, Syria.
Wonderful.
All right.
We'll take the hospital angle.
You two find out who paid for that container, what else was inside it.
Now, that one's easy.
It was being shipped by a local charity group, The Foundation for Emigrant Relief.
: Oh, suddenly, I have a overwhelming urge to do some charity work.
 what's happening at work is, you know, it's a sign.
That maybe the universe is telling us it's ready to move on to the next chapter of our lives.
Which is?
I don't know, but maybe it involves a career change.
Okay, I'll take the bait.
What would we do?
Well, we could be a couples figure skating.
(laughs)
What about Bali? You always wanted to go to Bali.
Yeah, for a trip.
Why not go for more?
You know, go down there, we could become personal trainers, you can teach yoga, I could... teach surfing.
You could ride your horse on the beach.
Yeah, those aren't careers.
Well, if you bring somebody with you, it is.
Oh, tourism.
Yes, let's do that.
Have you met me?
Okay, fair enough.
Um... in all seriousness, though, (chuckles) how much longer are you gonna do this?
Well, in case you haven't noticed, this isn't just what I do.
This is who I am.
Okay?
I grew up on Marine bases.
Protecting people is all I know, and if I wasn't doing this...
I don't know what I would be doing.
I understand everything you're saying.
I'm just saying you would also be an amazing mom.
Whoa.
And... you're passionate and loving and intelligent and articulate.
And how fun would it be to be there in the morning and make frittatas for kids?
To be home and helping them with their homework and not out all day being shot at.
And the father?
Same thing.
I could build tree forts.
Teach some jujitsu in the backyard.
Say it.
Just say it.
You know I have thought about this many times.
But I don't...
I don't think I'm ready... yet.
I mean, if I wasn't working for NCIS, I'm pretty sure I'd be working for any other agency: the FBI, DEA, ATF...
I'm just not ready.
(quiet chatter, phones ringing)
Hi.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah, I was just wondering if you have any volunteer positions available.
Are you here to fulfill a community service requirement?
(laughs) No.
I'm just here to lend a helping hand.
Okay, well, do you have any special skills?
Uh, yeah, I'm a pretty good ventriloquist.
(high-pitched): Yes, yes.
He's quite fantastic.
(in British accent): No, that's a lie.
He's rubbish.
Rubbish, I say.
Of course. Yeah.
: Dr. Cohen to Peds ICU.
Dr. Cohen to Peds ICU.
You ever seen this guy before?
No.
He's wearing gloves.
He never looks at the camera.
It's not much to work with.
What else do you remember about him?
Have an accent?
Tattoos?
Sorry.
And what about the truck they were driving?
Did you hear anything, any names?
I mean, it all happened so fast.
I thought it was just another hospital mix-up.
By the time I came around, they were long gone.
We'd like to get a copy of this footage.
I wish I could give you more.
Do you have a bucket list?
Yeah. Why?
Thanks for your time.
Thank you.
: Dr. Collins, extension 2219.
Dr. Collins, extension 2219.
See?
Even the doctor has a bucket list.
I bet you the guys who stole that truck have a bucket list.
Oh, sure, yeah.
Become a martyr, collect 72 virgins, which always seemed kind of excessive to me.
Wouldn't six be enough?
Now, we know these guys have a truck, and they have a pallet jack, but they also need a place to take those machines apart.
Garage, backyard.
City's NEST sensors never went off.
Well, it's probably shielded while it's still in the machine.
Yeah, but they took it out and moved it.
All right, so they're careful.
Maybe used some sort of shielded containers.
(phone ringing)
It's not something you grab at Home Depot.
What do you got?
Okay, so I found several companies that sell everything from lead-lined containers to lead blankets.
Most go to legitimate businesses-- hospitals, labs, universities-- but there are the occasional individual buyers.
Three in California in the last two months, to be exact, but only one in Los Angeles.
Antiqam Industries.
Problem is, I can't find anything on Antiqam except for their address.
Arabic for vengeance.
Subtle.
Good work, Nell. Why don't you send us that address?
Oh, Nell... any news back there?
Just that Under Secretary of Defense Duggan and his people look to be moving in permanently.
What about Hetty and Granger?
I haven't seen Granger, but...
Hetty's currently packing up her desk.
:
Quick, quick word.
Quick... Excuse me.
Whoa, Ms. Ch... Miss...
Ms. Chen.
I love it when you ignore me.
What are you doing?
We're running some pen tests.
Pen Te...
Whoa, there's no food or drink in here.
If you could... no, no, you-you got to take that outside.
There's a...
Whoa, buddy, that is not a toy.
If you could... if you could just put that... put that away.
Sir, what's your name?
What?
: This is Eric Beale.
He's a technical operator.
Uh, I'm actually 
 technical operator, and this is 
 Ops Center.
So, you're as much to blame for the breach as anyone.
What?
I'll have you know that I am the guy...
Who is needed downstairs, I think.
By who?
By me.
:
Doesn't look like much.
(device clicking and trilling)
(rapid beeping)
This place is hot.
Can we go in?
You can.
Thank you.
I'm kidding.
It's cool, as long as we don't camp out here a few weeks.
: Place is a ghost town.
Somebody's been busy in here.
Cover me!
Cover?
(gunshots continue)
(grunts)
(grunting)
(groans)
(coughs, sputters)
Thanks.
Least I could do.
I don't even know where to start.
Uh, felony theft?
That's as good a place as any.
With aggravated assault?
That is bad.
Uh... arson and attempted murder of two federal agents?
You did try to burn us alive.
In fact, you actually set him on fire, and he does not like to be set on fire.
I personally don't like it, but he really hates it.
: Possession and transportation of radioactive materials for the purposes of terrorism?
We call that the big T.
: Yeah.
This is where you get smart and cooperate.
Hmm.
I think he's giving us the old jihad silent treatment.
Mm.
(speaking Arabic)
(speaking Arabic)
(speaking Arabic)
Goes double for me.
What'd you say to him?
I told him you find him sexually attractive.
(chuckles)
And, uh, can't guarantee I'd be able to protect him from the blue-eyed devil.
Duggan already kick you out?
Hmm. No. He would have, if I hadn't gotten Captain OCD out of there.
Um, they were touching everything, and they were eating in Ops.
Oh, those filthy dogs.
All right, so who is this guy?
: I have no clue.
He had no I.D. on him, his prints aren't in the system. and facial rec's drawing a blank.
Everything associated with Antiqam Industries has been bogus.
Okay, so what about his cell phone?
You think you can crack it?
Yeah.
No. Maybe.
Assuming he didn't institute any anti-hacking features, which would wipe it clean on any unauthorized attempt or compromise.
Have you tried just asking him?
Open it.
: Clearly, that didn't work.
That was my phone.
Yeah, but you backed it up, right?
It's a good thing it wasn't his phone.
: You can add destruction of federal property.
: Give me that thumb.
: Thank you.
You're lucky.
Last guy...
He lost three fingers before we found the right one.
Nice work.
This one's gonna need some work.
Mm-hmm.
I finally caught Mew and Zapdos.
Well, easy come, easy 
I'm heading back to Ops.
Good luck with that.
This is going to Syria.
Y-Yeah, I mean, mostly we ask for money, just because it's the easiest to deal with and send over there, but we also accept clothing and food, toiletries and toys for the kids.
And medical supplies?
Yeah, sure, I mean, when we can get them.
And who donates those?
I don't know offhand, but I'm sure I could figure it out.
Why? What do you do when you're not volunteering or doing ventriloquy?
Well, we like to refer to it as "ventriloquesting"
'cause we consider it a lifelong quest, but mostly now I'm just trying to convince my fiancée to move to Bali with me.
: Whoa, whoa.
You do not get to call me that.
You only pre-proposed.
That was not official.
And I was open to the idea, following a legitimate offer.
Wait, who doesn't want to move to Bali?
Uh, someone with a great job protecting your millennial skinny butt.
: To be honest, I think she's just afraid of change.
I am not afraid of change.
I am not afraid of anything, Deeks.
I will come in there and kick your ass.
Well, I mean, if she doesn't change her mind, let me know, 'cause I would love to move to Bali.
Okay.
: Yeah, I'm sure there's nothing she wouldn't volunteer for.
Meow, kitty.
I'm sorry?
What? I saw a cat.
: You know what, Uncle McFlirtypants?
Why don't you check your phone?
Sam and Callen have a suspect.
Um, actually, you, uh... you recognize this guy?
Yeah, actually, I've seen him around with one of our donors.
One of your donors?
You remember your donor's name?
He didn't say.
He wanted to remain anonymous.
Probably 'cause the Ferrari he was driving was worth more than our operating budget for the next 20 years.
Really?
Yeah.
: That's interesting.
:
Once they've been vetted, deactivate their access cards and see that they're escorted off the premises.
We're all over it.
You got a minute?
Not really.
Humor me.
I'm afraid there's little room for humor in this situation, Assistant Director.
There are a millions ways this could've been handled.
Having you come here personally makes the least amount of sense.
You know what they say.
If you want something done right...
Just wait a second.
Just hold it.
What is it that you want?
I want to keep this nation safe from our enemies.
And since you and your people haven't been able to do that...
My people have done more to keep this country safe...
Your people can't even find a mole in your own house.
If you could, I wouldn't be here.
If I were you, Granger, I'd be focused on my future.
You know how this works.
Somebody's going to take the fall for this.
It's either going to be you or Hetty.
Do you really think I'd sell her out to save my own skin?
I don't know.
But if you're going to, I'd suggest you do it sooner than later.
I offered her the same deal.
Hetty?
Is this really necessary?
I mean, they can't... they can't replace all of us.
They certainly can't replace you.
We're all replaceable, Nell.
Well, I disagree.
And I think you know I'm right.
If there's anything you've taught me, it's to never give up.
You only lose when you stop fighting.
You know who told me that?
You did.
Mm.
I think I read it on a fortune cookie.
Henrietta Lange is not a quitter.
Neither was Don Quixote.
Fine.
If you're not going to fight this thing, the least you can do is tell me what to do.
(quietly): Okay.
Keep our people in the field as long as you can.
Oh, I intend to.
Get everything you can on Duggan.
Yes, ma'am.
(sighs)
So, I think this guy's name is Elias Kattan.
Or at least that's the name the phone is registered to.
Look at all these calls.
This guy's on the phone more than my kid.
: Who-- Aiden or Kamran?
Both.
Wait, who's that?
That's our guy.
No, not him.
This guy.
I think that's Ahmed Han Asakeem.
A.H.A.
A.H.A.-- that's all over these texts.
I thought it was an Arabic name or, like, "Aha!"
So smart...
Yet so Beale.
So, who is this Ahmed Han Asakeem?
The more accurate question is: Who was he?
He was born Tobias Thoma.
Syrian citizen came here with his family.
Joined the Navy to help him get American citizenship.
He was in Naval Intelligence until he defected and became Asakeem.
Now he's a high-value target.
He's 
 high-value target in Syria.
And he's rumored to be high up in the Jabhat Fatah Al-Sham, formally the Al-Nusra Front.
And he's working to unite the Free Syrian Army with the Anjad Al-Shim Islamic Union.
Now, if our boy knows Asakeem and he's in contact with him...
That means that we may be able to locate Asakeem.
And if we can find him...
We can catch him.
(computer beeps)
Uh-oh.
What's wrong?
Just got a text on this guy's cell phone.
They're threatening to detonate a dirty bomb in L.A. if we don't release our suspect.
Uh, it's like the Invasion of the Brooks Brothers Body Snatchers in here.
Hey, Nell, where is everybody?
Armory.
And they took Nell as well.
Nell, do you want to talk about...?
Uh-oh.
Came as soon as we heard.
Did you find anything?
Possible high roller involved, and we're trying to get a name.
Yeah, we know he drives a Ferrari.
We're trying to find it, but it's proving difficult without full access to Ops.
Does Duggan know anything about this?
No. The last thing we need is someone second-guessing this.
Get Callen and Sam on the horn.
Yep.
: Where are we?
We're working on it.
They were stealing the cesium and sending it to other bomb makers.
Doesn't mean they can't build one on their own.
Or dump this stuff all around town.
Can we track the text?
If it wasn't being spoofed, I could give you an idea of where it was when the text was sent.
But how do we check that?
So this is where the cool kids hang out.
These are Special Agents Callen and Hanna.
You know Mr. Beale.
We wondered where you ran off to.
Can we help you?
Yes, and you can start by telling me what's going on here.
We're in the middle of a very time-sensitive case.
Then you best tell me quickly.
What now?
We need to find that Ferrari.
With pleasure.
: 
We also don't have time to make a mistake.
Handing over a suspected terrorist is never acceptable.
We're not handing him over.
We're using him to draw out whoever he's working with so we can seize any more radioactive materials they may have in their possession.
I think we should send a return text, responding as the suspect.
He'll say he's injured and needs to be picked up.
They will see right through that.
We can use his past texts and e-mails to mimic his voice and style.
The phone they used to send the text just came online today.
It's a burner phone, which suggests that they know he's been caught.
He can say he escaped.
This way allows us to control the setting.
Yeah, if it works out.
And if it doesn't, we've blown our one opportunity.
Well, we have one advantage.
Whoever sent that text isn't a pro.
What makes you say that?
: Because if he was, he would have walked away by now.
Whatever we do, we got to do it now.
The clock is ticking.
It's Callen.
Duggan's allowing us to go ahead with the exchange.
Maybe he's smarter than he looks.
But he's insisting his men join us.
So we get travel buddies?
God help us.
Oh, boo.
Well, you see this guy?
: So far, we've got nothing.
Not the best views.
Kens?
Nope. Deeks?
Ah... I've found a, uh, badly beaten piñata.
Oh, he deserved it.
You think this guy's gonna show?
Not if he spots our suit shadows.

Eric, we still got him?
No.
So much for teamwork.
(indistinct chatter)
: Granger.
I told you we should have controlled the setting.
Give a man enough rope, and he'll hang himself.
Shame it had to end this way.
This isn't over.
It is for you people.
We've got it from here.
Is it just me, or is today really starting to suck?
: Guys, I think I know who we're looking for.
What, the shooter on the bike?
No, we didn't find the guy on the bike, but we got a Ferrari leaving a parking structure in your area right after the shooting.
: It's registered to one Bassel Rizvi.

Yup.

You sure he didn't fall asleep?
I have actually seen that happen before.
And now I have, too.
Thanks for that image.
Sorry. I'll go check on him.
He say anything?
He was asking for his lawyer before he even got out of the pool.
You ask me, he and his buddy is just a couple of rich kids playing terrorist.
I blame 
They're rolling around town, pretending to live the thug life, using their trust funds to buy their way into the warrior lifestyle.
Oh, it's kind of like putting down a couple grand to have dinner with a presidential nominee.
Only in this case, it's to rub shoulders with Ahmed Han Asakeem.
The sound of fantasy jihad got a little too real.
One of 'em ends up dead.
The other one's gonna spend the rest of his life in prison.
Eric said no other calls were made from his phone after he tried to call us.
No calls to Syria?
Well, if he did, he didn't make it from that phone.
No, he's trying to impress Asakeem.
The last thing he wants to have to do is tell him that he may have been compromised.
That's probably why he killed his buddy.
No. If Asakeem doesn't know what happened, his people will still be expecting that shipment of radioactive saline.
We need to make sure it gets there.
You want to ship it to Syria?
Yeah.
When Asakeem's people show up to get it, we'll be there waiting.

Where's Duggan's lapdog?
She's still not feeling well.
L.A. doesn't agree with everyone.
Good.
Sir...
Under Secretary of Defense Duggan's already not happy that her team's going after this high-value target.
What happens when he walks through the door and catches us in here trying to help them?
What difference does it make?
He's gonna replace us all anyway.
This may be our last operation together, so we better make it count.
Mmm.
Where are we?
Well, Kensi had a run-in with an insurgent, but everything's cool.
Insurgents and cool don't really go together.
She handled it.
Yeah? She kill him?
She didn't say.
That means she killed him.
Where is she now?
We're not 100% certain.
Why not?
Well, you know, with the time difference and the data delay...
Hmm...
You are the worst liar in the world, Beale.
Aw, I take that as a compliment, sir.
You would.
Where are they, Jones?
We're really not sure.
And we know that they're on the move.
Then where are they going?
Don't make me ask twice.
Beit Jinn.
What?
Kensi found a cell phone on the man that she may or may not have killed.
: I personally choose to believe that she didn't kill him.
Just because I like to think of Kensi as...
Stop it!
Okay.
Based on the Intel recovered from that cell phone, they have reason to believe that Ahmed Han Asakeem will be there.
: So what?
They can't go into Beit Jinn on their own.
That'd be beyond stupid.
Get 'em on the horn right now.
They turned off their comms.
Why the hell would they do that?
Well, I think it's so you couldn't stop them, sir.
We got movement.
: Confirmation. That's him.
That's Asakeem.
Yep.
: Be a whole lot easier just to shoot him.
I'd like to get out of here alive, if possible.
Yeah, 'cause going and grabbing him is gonna be so much safer.
(man speaks Arabic)
: Kensi, Deeks, this starts going south, you get the hell out of here.
Not a chance.
Well, there's a little bit of a chance, though, right?
I mean, if it goes, like, really south, then we can go?
Shh.
Move.

What is that right there?
Uh, I'm gonna guess those are goats.
Maybe sheep, but most likely goats.
(computer beeps)
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna go with goats.
Yeah, definitely goats with a... a ten percent chance of sheep.
You got anything, Jones?
I'm not even sure what I'm looking for at this point, sir.
We're looking for our team.
Right.
Obviously.
Hey, maybe this is a good thing.
If we can't find them, maybe Asakeem can't, either.

Ah, Duggan's on the move.
Okay, wipe it.
Yeah.
What are you all still doing here?
Just the usual cleanup before we hand things over.
Is it usual for four of your team members to still be missing in Syria?
NCIS agents are active in 40 different countries around the globe on any given day.
Somebody should have told you that.
Save the show for the kids, Granger.
You don't impress me.
That really hurts my feelings.
I'm still waiting for your briefs.
You know, I'm more of a boxers guy, and I don't like to share.
: Just a personal quirk.
Downstairs, now.
Keep looking.

Asakeem.
Sit.
No, thanks.
They say it's worse than smoking, but you make yourself comfortable.
Do you really think you're going to survive this?
I'm still not sure what “this” is.
This is the end, for all of you.
Admittedly, there was a time when individuals like yourself and Hetty were untouchable.
The valiant Cold War warriors and their exploits of derring-do.
Anybody who calls it the “Cold War” clearly was never in it.
It's a different world now.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
No, Granger, unfortunately it's you who has no idea what I'm talking about.
See, you used to have the reputation of being a number-one badass.
But these days, even DC thinks Little Miss Sunshine runs the show, and I've seen nothing here to prove otherwise.
If I didn't know better, I'd think you have genuine feelings for her.
What can I say?
I'm a romantic.
You just don't get it.
Let me try and explain it in a way that you can understand.
I can do more with one drone than I can with 50 of your agents.
In fact...

“1D4D52C4.”
Are those coordinates?
: I have no idea.
Is that, like, a code or file name?
Sir?
They're chess moves.
It's one of the oldest openings in the game.
It's called the Queen's Gambit.
Sacrificing a pawn to gain an advantage.
Who's the pawn?
: Looking for someone?
I should have known you were behind this.
Behind what?
Don't play stupid.
Go find the others.
There is no one else here.
I don't believe you.
Go.
You are so finished.
You're right.
Oh, it's too late for that.
There's no way you're getting out of this by tendering your resignation.
No, no, this is not a resignation.
This is a confession.
Congratulations.
You found your mole.
You're the mole?
I wish that were true.
But there's no way you're going to convince me of that.
This is another one of your Hetty head games.
Everyone else who works here keeps their jobs.
I did this alone.
(chuckles)
You're in no position to make demands.
And then you will personally accompany me back to Washington, where I will hand-deliver this to the Secretary of Defense.
Do you really think that's going to make a lick of difference?
It's the principle.
A traitor with principle.
How novel.
: There's no one else here, sir.
That's okay.
We've got what we came for.
Cuff her.
Is that really necessary?
No.
But do it anyway.
(handcuffs clicking)
We repaired the damage to her femoral artery, and Ortho put an IM rod in the femur.
She's got good bounding pedal pulses now.
She going to Landstuhl?
Yes. She needs a head CT and an MRI, which we don't have on board.
Is she awake?
She's still in a coma.
We're incorporating therapeutic hypothermia to preserve her brain function.
She's gonna be kept cold until after neurosurgery.
Assuming she needs it.
Does she need it?
We need the CT and MRI to say for certain.
: Watch your back.
Excuse us.
I'm going with her.
: Transport is for patients and medical staff only.
And we have a full ride because of the fighting.
I'm her fiancé.
I'm sorry.
Hang in there, Kens.
I gotta get to Landstuhl.
Deeks, she'll be gone before we get there.
What the hell?
Why would you say that?
Not “gone” gone.
Look, she'll be stateside in 24 hours.
These guys don't mess around.
She'll probably get home before we do.
: Let's go.
Move.
I hope he was worth it.
