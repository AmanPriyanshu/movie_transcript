Delicious.
But, look, it's not just me.
Everybody loves special treatment.
It's that thing that says you're different, you're the best, you deserve shrimp.
So that's why when it came time to plan a family vacation, I knew I wanted to ball out.
Disney World, huh? Nice.
: Mm-hmm.
Oh, no. Not just Disney 
Disney World 
Ooh.
Mm.
I'm gonna give my kids the first-class experience I never had.
Boy, I sure would like to take Eustace to Disney World, but I'm not allowed to take him out of state.
Nor anywhere in my car.
It's just how it is.
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow morning. And it's gonna be insane.
All right, everyone. Call your wives.
Tell them you won't be coming home 'cause you're working late, only this time, it'll be true.
What's going on?
It's a real crisis.
All hands on deck for the next two weeks.
Just got an e-mail from Microsoft.
They hate the direction we're headed in.
What? No, can't that wait?
[ Chuckles ]
Subject line -- "We cannot wait."
Look, I can't do it.
I'm going on vacation tomorrow, man.
I need this. I've been working hard.
Are you kidding me?
None of you have done [bleep] around here since Pokémon Go came out.
Ohh!
Don't act innocent. No.
It's exercise.
I can't do it.
Excuse me.
You are running point on this.
Yes, I am, and --
Charlie can do it.
Whe-- hm.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right, I -- I can do that. Yeah.
You'll be great, Charlie.
Look, and if you have any questions, just call me.
[ Chuckles ]
Are you sure you can handle this?
It is around-the-clock responsibility.
I've been living here for two months anyway.
They're tenting my apartment for ghosts.
Weird things are happening.
All my shoelaces are missing and all my forks are flat.
So I haven't been back since.
[ Chuckles ]
Eustace!
What? God sakes.
I'm going to Disney World.

Me especially.
And then we arrived at Disney World ready to get turnt on our very special V.I.P. vacation at the most magical place on earth.
♪ I'm all the way up ♪
Guys, we are here, and it's a dream!
Crowds and 100% humidity. Ain't like no dream I ever had.
Oh, my God!
You know what? You didn't have to come.
Yes, I did. I rented your place on Airbnb, and I'm making a killing, too.
Hey, guys. Guys, what ride are we gonna ride first?
I think the faster, the better.
I want something that's gonna give me that same rush I feel when I drink after a random co-worker.
I can't wait to do Space Mountain.
Uh, actually, friend, you're gonna have to wait.
What do you mean?
Space Mountain has a height requirement.
Here's a map I pre-marked.
It's for someone with your humiliating shortness.
Small World? Dumbo?
I don't want to do baby rides.
Then get ready to enjoy 43 square miles of restaurants and bathrooms.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Laughter ]
We're going there!
Let's go do it!
Hello, Johnson family!
Oh, hey.
Oh, hey.
I'm Cody, and you better be ready to have a magical day!
Better be?
Earl, Earl, get my Vaseline.
Who is this?
Mama, mama, mama, mama.
Talking about "better be"?
Mama. This is Cody.
He's our V.I.P. tour guide, all right? We bought him.
Oh, well, you didn't actually buy me. I'm an employee.
Okay, well, do you really want to get mollywhopped by my mama?
All right, he's gonna take us around because we are special V.I.P.s, and he is the best.
Oh, I assure you you are in great hands.
In fact, before I joined the Disney family, I was a place kicker for an arena football team.
But that is a life I left behind.
Hm.
Okay.
Okay! So, these are your custom magic bands.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh.
All right.
And because you are guests at the Animal Kingdom Lodge, these will conveniently charge your purchases.
Yay!
Special.
Babe, babe.
Hm.
I like that.
I wish you would!
P-Pops. Pops, what's wrong, man?
Wait, you're mad that we're doing it right?
What the hell you talking about, boy?
We did it right when I took you to Disneyland.
Something wrong with your tuna, baby?
Pops, can I have one of those?
When you get a job, yeah.
Well, I got a job now.
And I have this.
This is linked to his credit card, yes?
Yes.
Come on, Ruby, let's go make it rain at Epcot.
Oh, my.
All right.
Well, we're going this way!
Let's go.
All right.
Excuse me. V.I.P. coming through!
V.I.P. coming through!
So, we don't have to wait in that line?
Hah! Nope. But be gracious, because we're not better than anybody else.
Hell if we're not. I paid a lot of money for us to be special.
[ Cellphone rings ]
You are special, honey -- very.
Hey, what's up?
Nothin' much.
Just, you know, handling some B.I. on the Microsoft account.
[ Chuckles ] Quick question.
Uh, asking for a friend, all right?
Uh, who is Microsoft?
Hey, Charlie, I'm gonna have to call you back, man.
Right now you're distracting me from feeling superior to the general-admission people I'm passing.
No, no, no, no, my friend's back is against the wall, and you got to help him, Dre.
Come on, man -- p--
Marshawn! Marshawn Lynch!
Oh, not him, man, not him. But thank you.
[ Chuckles ] That guy thought you were Marshawn Lynch, Dad.
Eh, it's just a flattering form of racism, son.
Now, anyone get motion sickness?
Anyone pregnant?
Oh, oh, hey, hey.
Yes, I am actually pregnant.
[ Gasps ] That's awesome, congratulations.
Thank you.
But unfortunately, mama bear, you're gonna have to sit this ride out because of your cub in the oven.
Oh. Okay, well, there's a lot of other rides I can ride, right?
Oh, absolutely.
Anything that doesn't have a sharp tilt, turn, loop, sudden drop, or sudden stop. [ Chuckles ]
Wow, bae, that's a lot you can't do.
I know.
Kind of I wish I didn't pay extra for you now.
Wha--
Single rider!
Dre.
We were going to get down to the very important business of being very important people.
My kids, they started off slow.
Excuse us.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Don't mind us. We're with the guide.
We're with Cody.
What are you apologizing for?
You're V.I.P., boy. Own this.
Don't hate! V.I.P. coming through!
It's natural to feel jealous.
Hey, we'll let you know how it is.
Don't make eye contact with me.
My God, whose kids are those?
They're mine!
You all have fun!
Cody. See you later!

I bought them tickets.
Opened up 17 Christmas cards at the post office to get that money. Boy never even thanked us.
Ungrateful child.
This is the worst ever.
Well, now it is.
[ Sighs ]
Every ride I like is off limits for me.
I should've just stayed home.
I mean, I could've gotten seven days alone in my house, no kids, no husband.
No you.
I can see how that would be appealing.
[ Flute plays ]
You know... I don't understand all the hype.
Can't do anything here that you can't do at the Chuck E. Cheese in Torrance.
Ooh, Black Jesus, if there was ever a time to set myself on fire.
Or... no fire, and we can just go back to the hotel.
I want to go back to the hotel.
That's the coward's way out. But okay.
Waiter! One Tom Collins to go!
You know, I don't see any other V.I.P. guides out here.
Are these people not doing V.I.P.?
They're not.
I saw that kid in the regular line -- twice.
Oh, they're definitely not.
That woman's wearing Bugle Boy jeans.
Hm. Cody.
Let me holler at you for a second, playboy.
I like you.
Oh.
The kids like you.
And I think you're a great guy, but we traveled clear across the country to have the most special week of our lives.
And if you think you're gonna put us with non-V.I.P. people, ooh, I'm not the one, Cody.
Well --
I'm not the one, Cody.
Hm.
Okay? Now, what is the most popular ride here?
And think good and hard before you answer.
Frozen Ever After at Epcot.
Oh, okay, take us the most shaded route.

Johnsons!
We out! Let's roll. Lead the way, Cody.
Oh.
Thank you.
Well, where's the damn exit?
Hey, is this the line to get out of here?
No, it's the line - for Soarin' Around the World.

Ladies and gentlemen, I have been on this ride 10,000 times.
I -- I have a PhD in animal behavior.
I have spent two days in the pouch of an Australian kangaroo, and I have [inhales] - never seen something like this.

There's only one word for this --
Indescribable.
Yes.

It's like seeing the face of God.
This is not only the circle of life.
This is the meaning of life.
Yes.

Well, take a picture. Shoot a video!
No, no.
Let's use our mind cameras.
: Well said.

So, what's next?
For you? I'm not sure. Your time with me is up.
Uh...
Uh, but I bought you.

Can't wait to get out of here.
Hey, should we get in that exit line over there?
No, that exit line looks way too rough for a pregnant lady.
Oh, I think we should get in that exit line.
Looks a lot gentler.
Or maybe get in that stupid Dumbo exit line over there.
Maybe sneak out above the clouds on that adorable elephant.
