We don't have any sleeping gas around.
Well, I can make some. I can go by myself.
There's no point in risking more than one person.
Just so you know, I trained in gymnastics for half my life.
Violet!

Ah!
Did you get what you need?
[sighs] We got it.

I think you used the chemicals to make a thermite bomb.
And what are you suggesting?
Only that you might have been responsible for the entire disaster.

They'll wake up every freak in the shelter.
Yeah, let's hope they're all asleep.
So our lives depend on knockout gas made by Violet Adams?
Pretty much.
We are so dead.
No. No. I said I'm not thirsty.
Liar. Come on. Drink up.
How much do you have left?

: That's it? That's the knockout gas?
Ether. It's strong sh1t.
So we chuck that into the shelter?
: It evaporates, and the freaks go down.
Yeah, so do we.
No, the gas is heavier than the air, so we wait for the freaks to fall asleep, the ether will settle, and then we'll go inside and get the masks.
Simple enough.
There has to be a better way.
: Oh, sure, we die of thirst.
All right, let's get the others. We need to pick who's doing this.
