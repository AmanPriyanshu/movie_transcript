So you're having lawyers ambush me?
You're making plans for the custody of his children without including him.
Natalie, I'm their father!
You don't get to disappear for a decade, then come back and have an opinion about what's best for those girls. So I'm taking you to court and I'm having your legal rights as their father revoked.
You don't get a vote.
I live around the corner.
This is the place?
If you need a cheaper place to live, it's a nice place.
It was really only a few times but we have a son and he is almost 7 years old.
I'm going to my sister's with Abby. Pack your things. Just go.
Nic, Nic, Nic...
NO!
 complaining about dying could actually be uplifting?
(chuckle) That feeling of being completely powerless you were talking about; there's a freedom in that if you can find it.
I... decided not to go this summer.
Like, to any of your classes?
Mom's gonna freak!
Yeah, so don't tell her!
Hi, can I have an application, please?
She wants to know that you'll be able to take care of yourself if you need to.
She's made these plans for who's supposed to take care of us if she dies... but I don't like them.
Could I come live with you?
(anxious breathing)
That was a side effect... from medication I'm taking...
(purring)
(kids' laughter on video)
(unintelligible)
(more laughter)
Found them!
Oh, those! Those are Granny Rose's.
You realize I was not offered a single ounce of that woman's jewelry?
Take it up with Mom!
You coming this afternoon?
Yeah, I guess. You already moved in?
I acted fast.
Are you gonna bring the kids?
What's all the fuss about this housewarming?
You move, like, every year.
I kind of signed a longer lease this time.
I hope, for a better deal on the rent?
Mm-hm!
Your lawyer called me...
Yeah, she's filing court proceedings against David.
We need to document his behaviour with the kids.
She said "Every detail I could "think of from when he wasn't there for them."
Now how hard should that be?
Look, if you're not up to doing anything, I totally get it, but if you wanna get your mind off of this mess with David, there will be alcohol!
(whispering): Which I can't drink!
Right, OK.
Well, hopefully, I'll see you later.

What?
(snickering): Nothing.
You OK?
Yeah... yeah, it's just the dizzy, it's good.
Really, it is.
It passes right away and it means the drug is doing something.
That's good!
Hey, are you studying, today?
Yeah, soon.
Why, did you... need something?
No... but I thought, maybe if you wanna take a break... we could just walk down to Sherbrooke, get some ice cream.
Maybe later?
Sure.
Has it ever occurred to you that he needs his freedom?

No microchip, no phone number; what am I supposed to do?
The flyer's almost done.
That's great! Why don't we hit the town and put these up? That'll be fun!
Will it? Even though you're secretly hoping nobody claims him? (little chuckle)
Anyway, I can't. Theo's coming over this morning.
OK.

Well anyway... if you change your mind, it's there.
OK, Mom.

And I was thinking about getting my bike from the garage and going for a ride up the mountain. Wanna come?
I would but I have a few resumes to drop off.
We can drop them off on the way out!
It's just... if a manager wants to meet me and apparently, that happens sometimes, it's... not gonna look great if my mom comes in with me, so...
OK. Hey, I'm really proud of how seriously you're taking this.

Definitely. (quiet little laugh)

Try to keep an open mind.
Me and Lance go back.
Met at Katacombs doing lines in the men's room!
I know I'm supposed to stand up here and say I miss him, and I do, sort of... but the truth is: Lance was a douchebag!
Did she just say "douchebag"?
Yes, she did.
Lance made me laugh.
So you slept with him too?
Uh, no, I did not!
You?
No.
...he was still the bright, dark light of my life.
How did you know this guy?
Never met him.
So it means...
Are we crashing this funeral?

You're early.
Yeah, uh... traffic was light.
Well, Abby's at the neighbours.
They have a trampoline.
They'll bring her back soon.
Should I wait in the car or...?
No, of course not, come on in.
How are you?
We're fine.
Your sister at home?
She's driving the boys to camp.
Don't tell me she's already put you to work doing groceries.
Oh, you won't believe this, I stopped by the house, this morning, they're tearing up all the base boards on the main floor. I think Brent is using the wrong plans or something.
No, I asked him to do that.
What, you did?
Yeah!
I've decided to replace all the trim and crown moulding.
Did he give you a price on that or...?
Four thousand.
Hm!
No, it's good! It's a good idea.
Good!
Yeah.
Have you seen my keys?
(SMS alert)
You're waiting for a ride?
Actually, I'm driving.
Seriously? People let you drive them in that trashcan you call a car?
It's a job! OK? I'm saving good money.
Uh, Mom wanted you to drive us to Maggie's this afternoon.
You're gonna blow that off?
The Jazz Festival's on.
I can make like 200 bucks if I drive all day.
Is that what you're doing when you're out pretending to study?
What are you doing when you're pretending to look for work?
OK, I actually already submitted like 50 resumes.
Although... Dad invited me to lunch today.
I didn't know you two were talking.
We're not.
He found my Instagram and messaged me.
You're gonna go?
You don't think I should?
I think you should do what you want.
Just... keep your expectations low.
So, you're really not driving us to Maggie's?
Because I promised Mom we would meet her there.
And she seemed kinda needy this morning.
I'll pay you!
With what?
(with a tiny chuckle): You're down four life.
Done.
Fourth village...
There's my karma.
Bam!
Romy? Um... your cards.
This is... is mean but... Brain Raider.
I just destroyed your best chance at damage!
That's a problem for you!
I already have enough problems already, OK?
Actual real world problems.
Like making cat memes?
Why did you invite me here if you don't wanna play?
You invited yourself.
You know, forget this.
I don't want to!
Come on! Come on, you love La Ronde! You and me, kiddo! Come on!
No.
All set?
Just been a little wrinkle here.
Oh yeah? What's wrong?
Just Abby was thinking that maybe, uh, I guess, the three of us could... go together?
Sweetie... very nice of you to invite me but...
I've got plans today.
And your father was very excited to take you himself.
Come on, come on!
Um... what if he takes you to the Biodôme instead?
I'm not gonna go if you're not coming.
Um, you know what? You guys decide.
(gibberish)
Hey, look, it was her idea, OK? I swear.
Look, maybe we could... we could all go.
Unbelievable.
What? What? What?
Un-believable!
What am I supposed to tell her?
Figure it out.
Abigail, come on, let's go.
Come on, anywhere you want!
I only wanna go if Mommy comes too.
OK, fine. Fine. You know what?
Uh, I will spend the day alone.
You satisfied?

Your father's just a little grumpy today.
It's OK.
You asshole.
OK, so I, uh, I made fresh Serrano salsa.
Fair warning: it is hot. You OK with that?
Good, OK. I'll be right back.
Why did you ask me here?
Well, to get to know my daughter a little.
Why did you come?
I was curious, I guess.
OK, so we both want the same thing: to know each other a little.
Mom obviously doesn't want that.
Yeah, uh, your mom let you know what's going on between us?
Not really. I know you guys are fighting over Romy and me.
Yeah and I'm really sorry that you're in the middle of it all, and I know your mom just wants what's best for you, like, I get that but...
Emma, I think that you are, you know, old enough to make up your mind about me.
Trying to be the dad I never had!
(snickering): Ouch! Wow! OK!
You, uh... you guys are tough!
You know, you and your sister. I like that.
(pouring): Old enough to make up my own mind, right?
Alright, so, tell me, what are your, uh... what are your plans for the summer?
Get a job.
Really? That's too bad.
You got the rest of your life to be miserable. Summer's for fun!
You have a... Do you know what you're gonna do?
Haven't had any luck finding anything.
I would even go for fast food at this point.
Hm! You know, I could probably finagle something for you.
"Finagle"?
Mm-hm. You, uh... you could be my researcher.
And research what?
We could find something.
You know, you could make your own hours...
I'm pretty sure I got some grant money lying around, so... you know, I could look into it if you're... if you're interested.
No.

Yeah, sure. No, you just let me know.

What happened to you?
Can I please talk to my wife?
What happened? Are you OK?
Uh, yeah.
No, I, uh...
Just somebody hit me.
That's... It's not exactly true.
I got into, uh, this kind of a fight.
(sighing): You can't just show up here like this.
Lizzie, do you mind?
It's fine.
Thank you.
Have you been drinking?
Uh...
Matthew, who hit you?
Doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter 'cause I do want to fight.
I want to fight for us.
I would do anything because I want this marriage. I want, I want you.
I love you.
And I know that you love me. I know somewhere in there, you still love me. I know it.
Ah, just, just... please.
Please, Nic, Nic.
OK, just... just talk to me.
Please just talk to me.

Where'd you get this?
She's Judge Susan Reeves, the head of the Corruption Commission.
Have you been talking to the chief?
No, but it's not good.
I am investigating the biggest story of my career.
You think you're in personal danger?
I want to do the story.
Appa, that is such a messed up idea!
You messed up idea.
No, Appa, that is not...
