Purpose of your visit?
Oh, it's a long story. [Chuckles]
Basically, I've come to reconcile with my brother.
See, our father could only send one of us to America, and it was me.
But Gene said he was over it when he came to Orlando, and asked me to be best man at his wedding.
Turns out, he
 over it, we got into a big fight, and he left me a note disinviting me, and stole our mother in the middle of the night instead.
So even though I am not the one at fault, I've come to set an example for my boys and show them I'm the bigger man by burying the hatchet.
I'll just write down you're visiting relatives.

I'm here on business.
I need to get $200 back from my brother-in-law who wronged me.

That's because it's empty. I'm buying everything we need for the year at the night market...
Back-to-school clothes, Christmas presents.
I packed only the essentials.

Evan, you don't need that.
According to these pamphlets, I do.
I went to our local AAA.
These are things every tourist should know when visiting Taiwan.
You're a member of AAA?
I don't understand the question.
You're not tourists. You're home.

Doesn't matter. This is still your home.
I'm so excited, I didn't sleep at all on the plane.
I've got something for that.
How are you at swallowing caplets?
Yo, my man, we need two stops.
Dad, how do you say, "Yo, my man, we need two stops," in Mandarin?
Why do you need to make two stops?
I have to find a fax machine on our way to Uncle Gene's so I can fax Alison.
She's going to the Kinko's near her dad's workplace every day.
We're not stopping so you can fax your girlfriend.
