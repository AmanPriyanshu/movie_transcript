Mom.
Listen to me.
Your name -- your name is Mary Sandra Campbell, okay?
You were born December 5, 1954, to Samuel and Deanna Campbell.
Your father, he bounced around a lot for, uh, work, and you bounced right along with him, and you ended up in Lawrence, Kansas.
How do you know all that?
Dad told me.
March 23, 1972, you walked out of a movie theater --
"Slaughterhouse-Five."
You loved it, and you bumped into a big Marine and you knocked him flat on his ass.
You were embarrassed, and he laughed it off, said you could make it up to him with a cup of coffee.
So, you went to, uh, Mulroney's and you talked and he was cute and he knew the words to every Zeppelin song, so when he asked you for your number, you gave it to him, even though you knew your dad would be pissed.
That was the night that -- that you met -- John Winchester.
August 19, 1975, you were married... in Reno.
Your idea.
A few years later, I came along, then Sammy.

And then I burned.

So, I need you to give me names and locations and everything else.
Dead drops, meeting places, an organizational hierarchy, because maybe with all of us working together, we can do what you never could -- make America safe.
