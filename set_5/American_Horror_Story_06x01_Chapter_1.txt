Oh!
My family was in danger and all I could do was watch.
 a lot of crazy thoughts go through your head.
: 
 fight or flight.
(inhuman howling)
Our friends used to tease us that they didn't like socializing with Matt and I because we were too perfect.
They'd get in fights in the car on the way home from dinner with us because... we made them feel like they weren't as in love as Matt and I were.
I won a free yoga class at a work raffle.
I'm a pharmaceutical salesman.
Shelby was the teacher. I... pulled a hamstring and never took a yoga class again, but it was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Things were going really well.
 decided to start a family.
Yeah, we found out that, uh, Shelby was pregnant on the same day that I got promoted to West Coast sales manager, so we decided 
(grunts)
(screams)
That was the worst night of our lives.
No, no!

Game of knockout. They had to pick a random person on the street, sneak up on 'em and... knock 'em out.
Help!
Yeah! Help!
Help! Somebody, help us!
: 
If I lost Matt...
Mrs. Miller?
Is he okay?
His orbital socket is broken.
He will need surgery once the swelling goes down.
Our bigger concern is he hasn't regained consciousness.
Well, I need to see him.
If I'm with him, he'll wake up.
I know it.
(heart monitor beeping steadily)
I was right.
As soon as we touched, he started waking up.
That's just... that's just the kind of connection that we have.
But she wasn't.
She lost the baby.
They don't know if it was the stress or-or, um, being pushed, but...
(clears throat)
...well she... she lost the baby.
We needed to get out.
I wanted to go east, to where I grew up.
My sister lived there.
My mom.
It was home.
It's, um, North Carolina.
Right near the ocean, but... but also full of the most gorgeous native forests.
It was so quiet and wonderful and calm. I think we just both just realized that at the end of the day, we weren't city folks.
: 
(laughs)
It was three bedrooms.
And two stories and a basement.
They told us that it had been built in 1792.
It was in great shape.
: 
Like the universe just wanted us to be there at that moment.
I also thought "there's no way we can afford that house."
: Opening bid is $21,000.
What is your bid?
Well, now, that includes the ten acres of forest around the house.
But you can't build on it.
It's protected.
That seems inexpensive. (laughs)
What's wrong with the property?
Hurricanes.
You don't want this house.
We bid $25,000.
$26,000.
Do I hear 27?
We bid $40,000.
 almost all of our savings.
It totally turned me on when he did that.
Going once.
Going twice.
Sold, $40,000.

If Shelby felt any different, she didn't say anything out loud, but I sensed a-a reluctance.
Maybe she missed the city. Maybe my wounds healed quicker. They were nothing compared to what she lost: a life inside of her.

Honey, it-it's just a hailstorm.
I drove through it on the way home.
I know what I saw.
It wasn't ice.
There were human teeth falling everywhere!
Weather 'round here does take some getting used to.
That's it.

I mean, teeth don't fall from the sky.
Raleigh is only two hours away.
WakeMed is one of the busiest hospitals in the state.

I was in Raleigh, two hours away, but I made it home in half the time.
Where's Shelby? Is she all right?
She's inside.
You her husband?
Your wife reported that she was assaulted and held underwater in the hot tub.
She

What do you mean, "claimed?"
I found no evidence of footprints or marks on the deck or in the grounds around the hot tub.
She also said her attackers were dressed in old costumes holding pitchforks and torches.
Does she imbibe?
I know exactly who did this.
It's those ZZ Top wannabes.
They've been trying to scare us off since we bought this place.
I'll bet it's the Polks.
Let me, uh, go have a talk with them.
Those guys keep to themselves, and they're, uh, not so easy to find.
We need protection! Get a gun.
What?! 
 he wasn't gonna do a damn thing for us.
He said he'd file a report, but I knew it would just end up in the bottom of a drawer somewhere.
Was it those guys from the auction?

I don't... I don't know.

What?
The cops said that they didn't find anything by the hot tub.
No fingerprints, no torches.
They must have come back for them.
I wasn't imagining things, Matt.
I wasn't.
Mm.
Do you think I'm lying to you?
Shelby, absolutely not.
No. I believe you 100%.
Shelby, no.
I'm sorry. I believe you.
I believe you. I'm sorry.

Not bad for an amateur.
So I called my sister.
Shelby never liked me.
Which is fine, because I was never a huge fan of hers.
I used to play volleyball in high school.
Back then, yoga was called "stretching," and it was something you did before, not as exercise.
(chuckles) Lee judged my yoga and my gluten allergy 
She thought I was too much of a phony for her brother to marry.
I got my degree in criminal psychology from UNC.
Didn't work out though.
I didn't start taking pills because of some fault in my character.
I got hurt. On the job.

Divorce? Now?

Three times.
Which is three more the amount of times than you've touched me in the past month.
I'm done with this.

Hmm.

Oh, Jesus!
Oh, Jesus, Lee!
Don't sneak up on me like that! You scared the sh1t out of me!
My brother married one jumpy bitch.
She knew why we called her there.
And she knew that someone was messing with us.
Why would she move the knife like that?
So when did you become a cook?
What is that supposed to mean?
Recently.
It relaxes me. Mmm.
Cookin'? Yes.
Cooking.

While I'm here, could you please not drink inside the house? I know it's your home, but I'm hanging on to my sobriety by my teeth here.
But don't worry, I'll stay sober.
Somebody's got to protect you from the wild men in the woods.
And I appreciate that. Although...
I wish you still had your badge and your gun.
Well, I may not have my badge, but Mama's still packin'.
I never put much stock in the stories my sister-in-law was telling my brother.
I figured she was just trying to scare him so they'd pack up and move back to L.A.

Shelby, um...
I thought Shelby was messing with me.
Why, Shelby?
Why would you do something like that, huh? Do something like what?
This. Why would you do this?
I didn't do anything.
And I certainly didn't finish off that wine, so maybe you're the one seeing things. Wait a minute. Hold up. I'm seeing things?
The reason I'm out here is because of what you been seeing.
(phone buzzing)
:
I thought it was Shelby texting to say good night, but it wasn't her.
It was an automated alert from the security system I'd installed.
Well, bottles just don't roll across the floor by themselves.
Why you messin' with me? For the last time, I didn't do it!
God, everything is a five-alarm emergency with you.
: 
When a mob shows up at your house in the middle of the night with torches, they are not there to welcome you to the neighborhood.
Do you know how many hours Matt spends worrying about you?
: 
Every time you have a problem, you call Matt.
Your husband's mean to you, you call Matt. Uh-huh.
You fall off the wagon, you call Matt. Well, that's what families do!
We look out for each other! Yeah, except for you take.
You take and you take. Where were you when Matt was lying in that hospital room, unconscious, fighting for his life? Where were you...(door opens)

Please just don't let me be too late."

The cops had come and gone by the time I got there.
Lee said they took a report and chalked it up to vandalism.
This was not vandalism.
This was terrorism.
How did they do this so quickly?
: That's not the point, Matt.
They broke into our home.
They locked your sister and me in the basement. They were here.
They lured us down there, made us watch this creepy video.
What video?
: 
 but I went down with him anyway because I wasn't going to be alone in that house.

I mean, I thought the video was fake.

I finally got you, you son of a bitch.

People do this all the time.
Neighbors or locals do crazy things to try to drive out the new homeowners, so they can come in and buy the property cheap.
They're just trying to freak us out, so that we'll leave.
Well, it's working.
I want to leave, Matt.
Now.
If they want the house that badly, let them have it.
Did the cops see these tapes?
: They don't care.
They just think it's some good ol' boys being good ol' boys.
You know they're not gonna lift a goddamn finger to help us.
: Come on, Shelby, Shelby, come on.
You got to let the cops do their job.
Oh, don't take this personally.
Matt.
We have to leave.
It's our home, Shel.
Our life savings.
Where are we gonna go?
And with what?
You cannot let these people run you out of your home.
You're not even listening to me.
Wow.
You know what?
Just... Just do what you want.
Shelby...
Oh, let her go. Give her a little time to calm down.

Who is this guy?
: Another member of that redneck family?

Shelby!
Shelby!
Shelby just... left.

Humans respond to fear in two simple ways-- fight or flight.
There's no shame in getting the hell out of the way.
