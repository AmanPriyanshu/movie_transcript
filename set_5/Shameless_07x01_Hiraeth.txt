Yeah. Great.
(LIP CLEARS HIS THROAT)
Boo, good morning. (SMOOCHES)
School, hey, up.
Good morning, Fiona.
You okay?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, just walk right by.
Ignore your father that you tried to drown in the river, that you left in a hospital to rot.
I was only telling the truth.
You can't kill the truth.
The truth will set you free.
(DOOR OPENS)
Hey, good morning.
Coffee?
Nah, thanks.
Only got a couple hours of sleep.
Apartment fire around 10 last night.
Then a multi-vehicle on South Lake Shore.
I'm gonna hit the rack.
You okay?
Fine.
You don't look fine.
(REFRIGERATOR DOOR CLOSES)
Want me to guess?
I have to get to work.
It's Denise, right?
(REFRIGERATOR DOOR THUDDING)
We grew up together.
She was my senior prom date.
You went to senior prom?
Hell yeah. I was voted prom king.
Gay man having a fag hag cover for him with his friends.
And with my family.
Look, I was the quarterback.
I had to keep up appearances for school.
Uh-huh. Your family like her?
Loved her.
Still hear about her from my folks.
How great she was, how beautiful and smart, and what a shame it is that I let her get away.
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)
Jesus, join us for dinner if you want.
We're going to Wildfire.
Well, Lip just got out of rehab, so... I'm gonna catch up with him later.
I'm gonna hit the shower.
Say hi to Lip for me.
(FOOD SIZZLING)
Hey, Fiona, that preppy shithead guy is out here again.
Chad?
Hi.
You finally find someone to run this dump?
(CHUCKLES) I wish.
We're still interviewing.
Look, I was hoping I could impose on you to keep filling in for the next few weeks.
I-I'm sorry. This is my fault.
I've been stuck in planning hearings with the city over this new multi-building project on the West Side...
Look, this management thing is a pain in my ass.
I'm losing money.
I need to get back to waiting tables, where the real money is.
Waiting tables is real money?
Beats the minimum wage you guys pay management.
Da... better than minimum wage.
Not by much. With all the extra hours I end up having to work to cover all the bullshit that comes up?
I-I came in yesterday at 6 a. m.
I didn't get home till 9 last night.
Okay, tell you what.
Pay yourself an extra 50 cents an hour and make up the difference.
You would be doing me a huge favor.
An extra buck an hour.
Done.
: Hey, there.
Hey.
I love your dress.
Hey, everybody.
Hey.
Debbie? Where's Franny?
With my nanny, Jolayemi.
You have a nanny?
Well, she's actually my night nurse.
What's a night nurse?
She stays up with Franny so I can sleep through the night and wake up refreshed and ready to greet the day.
Can your night nurse watch my Kwandi, too?
Sure, no problem.
It's only $20 an hour.
Twenty bucks?
(BELL RINGING)
Premium infant care doesn't come cheap, ladies.
Gotta go. Algebra.
Hey! (CHUCKLES)
I can do it, but I don't recommend it.
Recovery's going to be tough at 16.
I'd suggest you find another girl.
I don't want another girl.
You won't be able to have an erection while the incision heals.
How long will that take?
Four days before the stitches can come out.
How much it cost?
Around $1,500.
(SIGHS) It's all right, son.
You're gonna get through life just fine without being circumcised.
No, I have the money.
I just need to dig up my rainy day fund.
Can you fit me in this afternoon?
(TV IN BACKGROUND)
You asked her to go through our checkbook and bills?
She figured out my screw-up with the Alibi books so fast yesterday, I figured she should look at our home finances too.
She does so many things well.
Yeah.
I mean, I thought 
 were good in the sack, but she's like the Michael Jordan of erotic stimuli.
She is an experienced s*x worker.
It's like she has three hands and six tongues.
That thing she was doing last night?
I know, and I think she was texting at the same time.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)
Family meeting. Tonight.
Family meeting?
What, is that what we're calling s*x now?

What a beautiful baby.
Ah, yeah, she is, isn't she?
What's her name?
Franny.
Well, I hope Franny knows how lucky she is to have such a wonderful mother.
I was being a good father.
A great father.
Exposing a liar who was gonna ruin his daughter's life.
And she treats him like a pariah?
(INHALES)
Ooh...
People won't hear the truth.
They hate you for it.
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)
It's my fault.
Thanks.
I was too easy on 'em.
And now... they're soft.
Soft as baby poop on a warm summer's day.

Wow, there go a couple of billion brain cells.
(INHALES)
The world's gonna f*ck ya.
All you can do?
Take it up the ass and soldier on.
Hey, you're a pal for listening.
It helps having a friend you can talk to.
You sure?
If you've never seen Radiohead in concert, it's pretty fantastic.
Ah, thanks, but I gotta work.
Maybe you could get somebody to cover for you.
(BELL DINGS)
Really, I appreciate it.
But I got a boyfriend.
You got a new boyfriend?
Uh, no. You're off the professors, I'm off the men.
Really?
Don't sound so surprised.
Oh, it's just you've never stayed single long.
f*ck off.
What, it's an historical fact.
Well, no more. I'm done with men.
(BELL DINGS)
Uh, women?
No.
Relationships in general.
My instincts suck.
No shithead radar.
Just going cold turkey?
Worked for you, didn't it?
Yo, you done working soon?
(PHONE RINGING)
Uh...
Hi. Hey, Olga, can you get that?
:  Yeah.
Hi, Ian.
Hi, big sis.
I need your help with something.
You can go soon as you finish up in the back.
Sweet.
:  Candy's gonna be a couple of hours late.
Her gout is acting up.
Oh, crap.
Is there any way that you can...
No, sorry.
Melinda, Candy's gonna be...
Not a chance.
