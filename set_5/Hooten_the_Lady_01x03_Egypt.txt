On behalf of the Greek government, I...
I trust you will be extending our site to include this exciting new discovery?
Unfortunately I've already applied to excavate this site on behalf of the British Museum.
To display as many treasures alongside Lord Eldon's stolen mangos, no doubt.

When the Arabs occupied this country the Persians moved his body to another secret temple.

No one of rank.

Uh, but if we, uh, look more closely at these soldiers that Alexander is fighting, it's... quite clear that their uniforms are Per...

The lighthouse... signifies... the beginning of that original grid.

These paintings... represent different chess figures.
It's the anomalies in the frescos upstairs, those aren't depictions of battle scenes, they-they're the final moves of a Persian chess game.
Or, the equivalent.
So... these holes must be for the spears.
Gold... would be king.
And if the elphant represents the bishop, The chariot would be the rook.
So then we just have to... move the pieces, finish the game.
