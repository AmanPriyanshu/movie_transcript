Keaton is the founder of Paraspot, a microblogging service with over 100 million registered users.

He's with his wife, Sarah, and Paraspot's Chief Technology Officer, Levi Young.

Does this video footage capture the image of the driver?
No, it does not.
No, but...
I don't dispute that Oscar's car was involved in this tragic accident, but Oscar was not behind the wheel.

You son of a bitch.
I am so tired of being lied to this week, and you of all people...
Slow down. What's going on?
Sarah Keaton wasn't on Ambien, and you concocted some ridiculous defense and I almost fell for it?
We have a deal.
To never lie to each other.
To never... lie to each other.
So, I am looking you in the eye and I'm swearing to you Sarah was on Ambien.
She filled her prescription yesterday, and it was her first.
[Sighs]
You didn't know.
Sorry, Jake. It's been a rough couple of days, and I'm not just talking about work.
Is your boring, elitist, federal judge giving you problems?
Yeah.
Well, say the word. I'll kill him.
Or at least have the DWP shut off his water.
Don't worry.
Sarah will be on your show tonight.
I am not gonna go easy on her.
For all I care, throw her to the wolves.

You shouldn't be there.

Mr. Newsome, are you aware that furnishing alcohol to a minor is in violation of B&P code section 25658?
What kind of a question is that?
Well, it turns out Daisy Duke was the social director of Phi Delta and kept a video diary of the party.

There is your client serving alcohol to an underage Daisy.
She was 19.
That was 12 years ago.
The statute of limitations has run. You know that.
Cassie, normally I like dancing with other lawyers.
The push, the pull. Hell, I get off on it.
But given my day, I have neither the time nor the patience, so let me be perfectly clear about exactly what I think of your blackmailing, sleazeball client!
My brother is trying to say that although the statute of limitations may have expired, the Alcohol Beverage Control Board won't like the looks of that video.
Your client's liquor license is up for review next month.
Are you threatening him?
We're simply letting the authorities know that your client has a history of serving minors.
