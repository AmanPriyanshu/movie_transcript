Do you believe in that food that's on your plate?
: Oh, man.
Huh?

: You know, this is not a discussion.
Zoey, as long as you live under my roof, you will believe in God.
Now believe!
Mm...

Hey, Mama I'm sorry I'm late.
I was having amorous FaceTime with Davis.

You know what the Bible Belt is synonymous with?
Oh, no.
Bibles and slavery.
Oh, my God.
And belts.
Don't forget them belts, Dre.
Mm-hmm.
It is impressive how any word can get you to slavery.
Try, um, Skittles.
Go.
Oh, good luck with that.
Dre, you got this.
Ain't no brown skittles.
[Chuckles] Get 'em.
What I was trying to say is it's no coincidence that slaves became the strongest believers.
They were looking for something to get them past what they were going through, and that something was God.
And if you're struggling... displaced... hopeless... poverty-stricken... there is one thing that they have in common, and it's the belief that no matter where they are today, something better is coming in this world or the next.

Look at this.
Whoa!
We have surrounded our kids with so much white-people stuff that they no longer believe in God.
Dre...
So from here on out, no more almond milk, radicchio, hummus, goat cheese, or quail egg.
To hell with Whole Foods.
From here on out, we are a Food 4 Less family.
And you know who shops there?
Who?
True believers.
Okay, you know what? Dre, listen.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look, we just have to give Zoey a little time.
That's all.
She's just going through a phase, sweetheart.
Or maybe she isn't.
Okay.
There are more black atheists than you think.
We have a bowling team.
Wait. "We"?
Bowling team?
See, this is the problem.
There's a whole generation out there that's too comfortable.
They think they don't need God.
There's a straight line from entitlement to atheism.
Okay.
: Come on, Dre.
How could you believe in something so illogical?
: Listen, in Dre's defense, I've learned that science doesn't explain everything.
Oh.
You know, I've been around a ton of patients in the room when they die.
I don't know what you call it, but something happens, and you feel... something.
That hospital air conditioning... it's powerful.
No, no, no, no.
Something bigger than us.
Yeah, you ever seen a hospital A/C unit?
It's huge.
To keep it cold...
O-O-Okay.
Okay, okay.

I'm done. It's over, all right?
And no more talking about Zoey and atheism.
Whew! Hey.
Please tell me you said "aneurysm."
Mama...
Zoey's dying.
Wha...
She got a huge tumor, and it's about to explode.
Very sad.
What?
Dre! Dre.
Huh?
Ruby, Ruby.
Nothing is wrong with Zoey, okay?
She's just being a teenager, and she's asking questions about God.
Just...
Yeah, questions like, "I don't believe in him."
Wait. [Stammers]
Oh.
Just a minute.
See, see, that's what I'm talking about.
This all your fault, Rainbow.
No.
Nuh-unh-unh.
Your family history of blasphemy has seeped into my grandbaby and damned her for eternity!
Oh, Black Jesus!
Let the miracle of your aneurysm take her now.
Take her now!
No! No!
Don't ask Jesus to kill our daughter!
We can make her believe!
I am talking about Rainbow.

Non-believer sounds so judgmental.
I might not believe in God, but I believe in a lot of other stuff.
I believe in community.
I believe in friendship. I believe in love.
Oh, you sound so stupid.
Zoey.
I know you're having fun testing the boundaries.
But you got to know that there's somebody up there that's looking out for you.
: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Like God looked out for Noah in the great flood.
In that story, didn't God kill everyone that wasn't named Noah?
Now, the answer to that is yes!
Glory, hallelujah.
Zoey, focus on your curl pattern.
Okay, that's something real, something you can touch, not some fairy tale in the Bible.
I'm not talking about the Bible.
Wait a minute. [Stammers]
What are you talking about, then?
Zoey, I'm talking about you believing in something that's higher than you.
: Mm-hmm.
Something that's gonna help guide and comfort you through life.
