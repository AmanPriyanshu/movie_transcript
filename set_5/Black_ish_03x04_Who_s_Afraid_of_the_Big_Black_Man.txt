There was a little snowflake on the elevator, so I had to take the stairs.
Me too.
Careful, Dre.
Someone's out there setting traps.
I don't understand.
Why are you two so afraid of a baby?
We don't have the luxury of being helpful because we're instantly seen as threats.
Well, that's just common sense.
I see any adult male as a threat.
The point is, we can't get away with half the stuff that you guys do.

America's favorite TV character's catchphrase is to punch his wife in the mouth if she says another word.
Yeah, but he was a lovable Teddy bear.
What?
If I was a TV character, my catchphrase would be, "Oowee."
In the show, my wife name would be Wee.
And every week, she'll go one step too far, and I'll punch her in the mouth.
Stop.
Ch-Ch-Charlie.
Relax. It'd be a cable show.
Look, I'm sorry I'm late, boss.
There's a little white girl in the elevator.
Almost had me.
I saw my freedom flash right before my eyes.

I married a monster.
To be fair, as a black man, we can never be too careful.
Mm-hmm.

You did the right thing, son.

I'm not saying the world stopped being racist.
You just haven't noticed some things are different.
You got to listen so you can hear.
I'm trying to teach you, Dre.
I couldn't possibly hate you any more than I do right now.
Look, I'm serious. Come get blessed at my showcase.

Yes, Junior.

And now that they're not, you're still upset.
Well, if you say it out loud, anything sounds crazy.
Dre, what's going on?
I'm losing my identity, Bow.
Look, when the whole world hates you, you develop armor.
You wear sagging jeans, rock chains, and expensive kicks like, "You don't like me?
Cool. I don't care what you think."
But if I don't have that edge, then who am I?
You're someone who likes necklaces and hoards lots of shoes.
Oh, my God.

Dre, when you get stressed about these things, I'm the one who suffers.
You took the good sink!
You don't get to take my struggle, Bow!
Dre, I'm serious.
You wake me up so you can spend three hours dressing like you don't care what anybody thinks.
The neighbors give me the side-eye 'cause you treat them like Russian spies.

Okay.

It's not gonna kill you to wear the same pair of sneakers two days in a row or to just wave at the neighbors.
Just, like, wave at them.
Because if you don't change, babe, then they're not gonna change and nothing is gonna get any better.
I think what you're saying is... my shoe game is holding up racial healing.
Yes, Dre.
So why not just lead with that?
I don't know, but I'm glad I said it now.
Now we know it's your sneakers.
We got to bring them to the government so they can fix our world.
