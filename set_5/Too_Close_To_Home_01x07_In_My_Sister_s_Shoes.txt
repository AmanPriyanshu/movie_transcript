: Son, can you hear me?
Why did you leave me?
It's so...
Complicated.
[Chuckles] Annie!
Oh, my god!
I heard some things.
I'm sure you have.
Come here. Take a look.
: Man, he looks really bad.
: Can your daddy help him?
Why did I ever leave here?
I made you do it.
Is this why?
What?
I've never heard of a girl named Daxter, Sheriff.
Where is that guy?
The one you were talking to?
You still have his credit card, don't you?
Give him two CCS of this.
[Gasps]
Why is she here?
Taking care of you.
After all these years.
Daddy, no!
This is a son of a bitch.
Daddy, what are you doing?!
Son of a bitch he is.
Daddy!
That's it.
There. Come on, you b*st*rd.
Dad, stop it!
There it is. That's it.
I am trying to get this...
Walrus to open his mouth.
Ohh. b*st*rd.
Daddy, step away from him!
Daddy, get off!
This son of a bitch!
Daddy, get off of him!
Move!
There it is. There. There.
There it is.
That's it.
You b*st*rd!
I finally got...
Sheriff, we got a problem.
What is it?
Come on.
Come on. It's in here.
What the hell?! What is he doing?!
I don't know. I stepped away from him.
How did he get his hand up in there?
I was in the bathroom for a second, and he'd done this.
Son of a bitch!
Dr. Allen!
Daddy!
Well, the ambulance is here.
I was leading them in, so they should be right behind me.
My god!
Dr. Allen!
He's not listening.
Dr. Allen!
Daddy!
Don't you see?
I am trying to get this walrus to blow up.
What?
I don't know.
Should we stop him?
We should get the paramedics up here.
You know, they were right behind me.
Well, go find them!
Yeah. Watch him.
Daddy, please. Please. What are you doing?
It's in there, the walrus.
There.
Dad, stop.
It's there. It's in there.
[Siren wails]
Daddy, what's in there?
The walrus is in there.
Daddy, what's the... What's the walrus?
There it is.
Yes! The walrus!
Yes, you son of a bitch!
[Siren wails]

Oh, yes. There it is.
This is a son of a bitch.
[Footsteps approach]
: Y'all better hurry.
We'll take it from here, sir.
It's in there.
What?
It's right there.
We'll take care of it.
The walrus collapsed, and I managed to pump it up again.
Yes. I... I see it.
Yeah, I see it. We got it.
Thank you, sir. Good job.
[Panting]
Really good job.
He's alive.
: Yes, I see.
Really good job, sir.
He's alive.
Yeah?
What?
Did he really do a good job?
It's messy, but I can tell his lung had collapsed.
You can see how his trachea is turning to the side?
He saved him.
Well, I'll be damned.
You can say that again.
Let's check his vitals and stitch him up.
Daddy.
Where's the flower?
Come on. We got to get you cleaned up.
I... I don't need to get cleaned up.
Yeah, you do.
Why?
You're not clean.
I'm not?
No. Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.
All right. Where is J.B.?
He's not here.
Oh, that son of a bitch!
You know, he killed your mom.
No, he didn't.
Oh, yes, he did.
He broke her heart.
Her damn goat.
Yeah, it was the goat.
That's what it was. It was that damn goat.
Yeah, I know.
You know the coyote caught him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did I save him?
Yeah, you did.
I have to get scrubbed up for surgery.
Yeah.
Hey, uh, Brody.
Yeah.
They need to talk to you.
Yeah, okay.
Look we stitched him up, and he's stable.
All his vitals are good.
Can he be transported?
Well, about that.
We can't take him.
What?
We can't. I'm sorry.
We have two other calls out this way, and we have to take them by priority.
What are you saying?
We have a call of a man who lost his leg by chain saw.
We're headed there now. It just came in.
He gets priority over your patient. We can't take him.
So you're just gonna leave him here?
This doctor took really good care of him.
Listen to me. You... You can't leave him here.
I'm sorry. W-we have no choice.
You could... you can bring him into Bessemer.
But we gotta go.
This is bull...
This is suicide!
Not with your father here.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Listen to me. You... You can't leave him here.
We gotta go.
I'm sorry.
Damn it!
Can you believe this?
Yes, I can.

[Dog barking]
Thank you.
For what?
For getting me out of here.
I mean, especially with Mama.
I forgot how nasty she was.
Yeah, well, at least now she's stuck inside a trailer.
[Both laugh]
Did you ever want to get out of here, Bonnie?
And do what?
Anything. You didn't want anything more?
What is there for me to do?
Bonnie, there's a whole world out there.
[Chuckles]
All right. Well, who's gonna take care of Mama and the kids then, huh?
If you could, would you?
That's why I admire you so much.
Don't say that.
I do.
I really do.
Bonnie, I just left you guys. That is not to be admired.
No, you did not. You got out of here, away from everybody in this town and you made something of yourself.
And I was never mad at you because of it.
And whenever I saw you on the TV or I heard from you, I lived through you.
I want to show you something.
What?
Wait here.
Where am I going?
Wait here. Just close your eyes.
Bonnie, what is going...
Close. Your. Eyes.
Okay, okay, okay.
[Laughs]
[Soft guitare]
What are you doing, Bonnie?!
[Dog barks]
Close them.
Okay. They're closed. They're closed.
Look.
What?
What?
Look at my feet!
Oh! Those are very nice shoes!
They're your shoes.
What?
Don't you remember?
No, I don't remember those.
Oh, Annie, you left those shoes here.
And every time that I wished I was anywhere else but here, I would put them on and I'd walk around in them all day.
And I'd wonder what you were doing, what your life was like.
Oh, I was so excited for you, Annie. I was never mad at you.
'Cause you did the one thing that I could never do...
You got the hell out of here.
Yeah, but you still can.
No, I can't. I can never do what you did.
And I don't mean that in a bad way, okay?
I just... I'm not cut out for that type of thing.
What are you looking at me like that for?
Annie, my life is okay.
It's not all thrills. But we do all right.
We struggle.
Struggle a lot.
But by the grace of God, we're okay.
I don't know.
What?
[Birds chirping]
J.B.
What did he do now?
Nothing.
Tell me.
Nothing. Annie, don't worry about it.
Are you're sure?
Mm-hmm.
I'm sure, honey.
Well, I guess you'll tell me in time.
There's nothing to talk about.
I'm sure I'll find out one day.
[Sighs] I think I may have to stay here for a while.
I know.
And I'm really scared.
I know you are.
You know, maybe I should, um...
You should get me a job so I can help you guys out.
Okay. Yeah, that's a good idea.
Maybe I could get you some shifts at the diner.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah.
What are you looking at over there?
No one's going to find you here. You don't have to worry about that.
No, no, I'm just... I'm just waiting for a friend of mine.
The guy that brought me here.
Oh. A friend?
No, not that kind of guy.
Just a really nice guy that said he was gonna stop by and say goodbye before he left.
All right, well, I think he would do that if he said he would.
But I got to get over to Dr. Allen's and take over for Brody, sit with him.
Is Brody seeing anybody?
No.
[Clears throat]
Why not?
Umm, I don't know.
Do you think he still loves me?
No, he's moved on.
Yeah.
Okay. Good.
Mm-hmm.
Good. Then...
So if you saw him, y-you'd be alright?
Yeah, yeah. I have no feelings for him.
None?
No, no.
Okay.
You know, he's... he's changed a lot.
He's not that skinny little boy that you once dated.
He's a man now.
That's good.
Yeah.
Good.
Good.
So you have no feelings for him, then?
No, no.
So if you see him, you'll... you'll be fine?
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right, well, I'm gonna go.
Are you gonna wear your shoes?
[Laughs]
Yeah, I think I will.
Yeah.
Okay.
I got to grab my purse and my keys.
[Sighs]
[Engine shuts off]
[Soft shrieking noise]
Is this it?
I think so.
So much for the country club.
I think this is the one.
This girl lies so much!
Right now we need to find Victor.
Hello?! Is anybody there?!
Hello?
: 
I'm looking for Anna!
My name is Dax. 
Who is Dax?
I... I'm a friend of hers.
Um, the door is locked.
Which way is that?
What in the hell?!
Who lives like this?!
Ugh! Gross!
[Television playing]
I'm in here!
[Insect buzzing]
I'm gonna wait outside.
Who are you?
My name is Dax.
And who is she?
Valerie.
And how do you know Annie?
You mean Anna?
I mean Annie.
He works with her.
Well, what do you want with her?
We need to talk to Anna. Is she here?
What do you want with Annie Belle?
My boyfriend drove her here, and we can't find him.
[Chuckles]
Your boyfriend. Oh, gee.
What are you, one of them pickle pickers?
He meant
 boyfriend.
Ugh. Well, she didn't come here with no man this time.
So she is
Maybe.
Do you know where she is?
No, I don't.
Who are you to her?
As she said, we used to work together.
In the White House?
Yes.
Was she screwing the President?
They were having an affair, yes.
And both y'all knew about this?
Look, we really need to find her. Do you know where she is?
Well, like I said, she's not here.
And who are you to her?
Her mother.
And you have no idea where she could be?
No. I don't talk to your kind.
Will she be back?
[Insidious giggles]
Who's to say?
Thank you.
Come on, Dax. Let's go.
We need to find him.
Hey!
I asked you a question.
I don't talk to your kind.
And maybe you should get your daughter to fill you in on that.
Well, maybe you two should get the hell out of my trailer.
No problem.
Go on, now. Get!
Dax. That lying bitch.
I can't think about that right now.
We need to find Victor.
I know. I'm sorry.
[Telephone rings]
Hello?
Some people's outside looking for you, girl.
Oh, you know what? That must be Victor.
But they're looking for Victor.
Did they say who they are?
I gotta go, Mama.
Wait. Who is that?
Girl, you better tell me.
They're just some of my friends, okay?
Yeah.
Huh.
Anna!
Hi.
Where's Victor?
I don't know. He was supposed to come say goodbye to me when he left yesterday.
He hasn't been here?
No.
What's wrong?
You bitch!
 what's wrong.
You guys, what is going on?
Dax was on the phone with Victor last night, and he was drunk at some bar.
Then Dax heard him getting beat up on the phone.
I told him not to go.
Where?
Uh, it's just this bar in town.
What's there? What is there?
Just... a bar. It's a bar in town.
Take me there!
I don't have a car.
Well, drive this one!
Now.
Okay.
[Tension building]
[Engine turns over]
[Tires screech]
[Quiet again]
Hello?
Hey. Come.
What? Okay.
Come.
Who is this?
Don't know his name.
What is he doing here?
Sheriff Mobley found him beat up in an alley somewhere.
Brody, he should be in a hospital.
Yeah, paramedics won't take him.
What?
[Chuckles]
They said that he's stable.
They had another emergency, and so they're gonna try and come get him tomorrow.
Is he going to make it to tomorrow?
According to them, my father saved his life.
What?
Yeah, his lung had collapsed, and he got the air out.
Now he's breathing fine.
Wow!
Yeah. Tell me about it.
Where is your daddy?
Watching the game. He'll sit there for hours.
Okay, well. I'll sit here with the both of them.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Okay. I'm going to go out into the fields.
Okay.
Bonnie?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Brody.
Look, I was just gonna hug you.
Calm down.
Annie's here.
She is?
Yeah.
How is she?
She's... she's fine.
She's staying in my house.
Oh, okay.
Okay. Go on, now.
Go.
W-wait.
What does that mean?
I'm gonna sit here with them.
No, I'm not talking about that.
Why'd you bring her up?
Just thought you should know.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Okay.
What the hell?
Like seeing a ghost, ain't it?
Yeah. Annie Belle.
Hey, girl. How are you?
I'm doing all right.
We're looking for a friend of ours.
I was hoping you could help.
Who's "we"?
Just me and my friends here.
He's her friend.
What's going on?
We're looking for this man. His name is Victor.
Tony, have you seen this guy?
Well, they're so close. I can't tell.
Which one?
That one.
Nope. Can't say I do.
So he wasn't in here last night?
No.
How can you be so sure?
Hey, honey, I know all of my regulars, and he sure as the hell ain't one.
So, Annie Belle...
Is it true about you and the president?
Are you sure you haven't seen him?
Hey, where are you from? Because you are awfully rude.
Really, we're just trying to find our friend.
He looks really upset.
: Who's he to you?
He's...
He's his boyfriend!
Okay. Wow.
Look here, you back-wooded country-ass bitch.
Valerie.
Shut up!
We work in D.C.
I have friends in the justice department, so if he has been here and you're keeping that from us, then you better tell us now!
Annie, you better get this uppity bitch outta here right now 'cause folks around here do not like your type.
I don't give a damn.
Hey! Hey! Stop it.
Do you know what a hate crime is?
I don't know. And I don't care. Get outta here.
It's when an ignorant son of a bitch like you two does something to me because I'm black or to somebody like his boyfriend because he's gay.
I swear I'll have the FBI in here so fast that...
Valerie.
I'm talking.
Just stop! Please. Stop.
Stop it. She said she does not know anything.
She's lying.
Annie, you better get these people outta here.
His credit card was used here last night.
You know what? I'm calling.
No. Lily, just... Was he here?
He wasn't here.
Stop. Lily!
What?!
Tell me the truth.
Okay? 'Cause she will call the FBI and you do not want the FBI around here especially with all this business you got going.
He was here.
Okay. And where was he? Does that mean he was...
Valerie, stop!
Please!
Fine.
Just let her handle this.
It was your sister's fault.
Bonnie?
Hell no. Shelby.
She was in here dancing around with him all night and getting him to use his credit card.
And I don't know who the hell he pissed off, but he was walking around here like a lady, and these boys don't take too kindly to that.
Where is he?
I don't know.
What did they do to him, Lily?
I don't know.
You go to see the sheriff, okay?
'Cause I didn't see anything, and I wasn't here when he left.
You're lying.
Let me go and call my friend at the justice department.
Let's go to the sheriff, you guys. Come on.
He's a decent man who'll help us.
Where is he?!
Come on. Dax, come on.
Come on.
Nice seeing you, Lily.
[TV on]
: Help me!
Dr. Allen, I'll be right back, okay?
Hello?
Who are you?
I'm Bonnie. Who are you?
I'm Victor.
Are you okay?
God!
[Groans] My stomach.
My head.
Chest.
[Coughing]
It's okay. It's okay.
Were you in an accident?
Where am I?
You're being looked after.
Where am I?
You're in Dr. Allen's house.
Am I still in Happy?
Yeah. Were you in a car wreck?
No.
What happened to you?
I got jumped by three guys. [Groans]
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah. Me too.
You're not from here, are you?
I'm from D.C.
Oh, no.
What?
Were you trying to help Annie?
Who?
Anna, my sister.
Yeah. I drove her last night here.
Oh. Oh. What the... god.
Yeah.
Great.
Who did this?
I don't know.
This is a doctor's house?
Yeah.
Right?
Yeah.
Is that him sneaking down the stairs?
Dr. Allen! Dr. Allen! Come here, come here.
Where are you going?
I have something in the bathroom.
Okay, well, let me take you there.
I don't need you to go in there with me.
Okay.
J.B.! Get your ass up!
We need you out in the field.
I'll be right there.
Don't pep-talk me, boy!
Need you out there now!
Dr. Allen, that's not J.B.
Yeah.
Let me help you to the bathroom.
Ah.
Shut up!
Old bitch!
[Laughs]
What the hell's so funny?
Do not tell me that...
That's the doctor that cut me.
[Groans]
[Laughs] Oh, my god. Oh my god.
And you call this place Happy?
[Laughs] Hmm.
Because everyone's on meth.
[Laughing]
That's crazy.
You know how long I've worked to not have scars on this body?
And that doctor cut me... [Laughs] in Happy.
How ironic. In my happy place.
[Laughs] What a coincidence.
[Groans]
Hey, you're gonna hurt yourself.
Just calm down, all right?
I already did.
Victor, this isn't funny.
Really?
Humor is the only thing that we have sometimes.
Where is your sister?
She's at my house.
I was supposed to go see her today.
I know that. She was waiting for you.
Can you call her?
Yeah. I'll call her.
Okay. Good.
Okay.
Hey?
Yeah?
Can you ask the doctor, who's obviously not in, if he can give a bitch something for the pain?
Yeah.
Okay.
[
]
[Beep]
Uh-huh. Yeah.
We'll send them right there.
Mm-hmm. How can I help you?
Is Sheriff Mobley here?
Hey, Sheriff, we got people out here for you!
Sheriff Mobley.
Anna.
How are you?
I'm good. I'm good.
This is Dax and Valerie. They're from D.C.
They're looking for a friend of theirs.
Does your friend have a name?
Victor.
Victor, huh?
What? You know him?
Yeah.
Where is he? Is he... is he okay?
He's... he's up at Dr. Allen's house.
What happened to him?
He's okay, but he's been beat up something pretty bad.
By who?
Well, we're... we're looking into that.
Okay, Anna, do you know where this is?
Yeah.
Can you take us there?
Yeah, come on.
Good to see you, Anna.
It's good to see you, too, Sheriff Mobley.
We'll talk later, okay?
Yeah.
Back to work.
Hey.
Hey.
He's awake.
Is he?
Yeah.
Okay, well, I have some pills downstairs the paramedics gave me to help with the pain.
Can you go get them?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll get it.
I want to check on him.
Okay.
Oh, my god.
Must have died and went to Heaven.
Are you Jesus?
No. I'm Brody. What's your name?
I'm Victor.
So sorry you have to see me like this. I'm normally cute.
[Chuckles] No, that's fine.
We have some pills downstairs from the paramedics.
They said that they'd help you with the pain.
Oh, she was already working on that.
Who are
I'm Dr. Allen's son.
Before I fall in love, did you do this?
No. My daddy did.
Are you in any pain?
All my life, honey.
But this I will live from.
Do you know what happened to you?
Oh, yeah. I do.
I was attacked by three guys... Or more.
One was about 6'3".
Tall, rugged, handsome.
And I heard something like "Tanner."
"Tanner."
And I heard the other guy's name, but I can't remember.
Oh, wait. Wait.
[Groans]
Your daddy said it.
"J.B."
That's what I heard.
That's all I remember.
Why do you think they'd beat you up?
'Cause I'm bisexual, honey.
For you, I'm gay
 the time.
I'm sorry.
For what?
For me wanting you?
I'm sorry 'cause they hurt you.
Ohh.
Sensitive guy, ain't you?
Yeah, sure.
The pills she's bringing up are gonna keep you from getting an infection.
Thank you.
Sure.
They're gonna make you sleep, though.
Oh, no.
I don't wanna go to sleep.
Then I won't be able to see you anymore.
Okay, okay. Sleep's not a bad thing.
Says the tall, sexy, straight man.
Yes, sir, I am.
"Yes, sir, I am."
So formal.
You should rest.
And you should get rid of your rules.
What do you mean, rules?
Boy-girl rules, girl-boy rules, boy-boy rules.
Any damn rules.
No. I think I'm all right.
You sure?
You should get some sleep.
Okay.
I'll be dreaming about you.
All right, my friend.
Got 'em.
Hey. How's my daddy?
He's good. He's sleeping.
How long does he usually sleep for?
Sometimes for hours.
That's not good.
Why?
Because he won't get a good night's sleep.
Yeah, then, I just sit up with him.
Brody, we need to wake him up, keep him up.
Yeah. I never really thought about that.
It's all right. That way, you can get a good night's sleep.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Okay.
All right.
Let me give these to him.
Yeah. I'll be in the kitchen.
Okay.
You were really nice to that guy up there.
Why wouldn't I be?
Well, you could then be like your brother and beat his ass.
I'm not my brother.
Yeah. I still can't believe he did that.
I don't know why.
He shows you every day that he's that way.
Well, it's over with now, and you know we're done.
What happened to your neck last night?
Did he do that?
No.
Brody, I don't want to talk about him. Okay?
I don't want him hurting you or that guy upstairs.
Nobody.
[Chuckles]
How'd you get so open-minded living here, huh?
It's still America.
Oh. Yeah.
Sure doesn't feel like it, though.
This town is like an island.
Just closes you off from the world.
Yeah. It makes you lonely.
Yeah, and you end up with the wrong people.
Yeah.
That's why it's important to keep the good ones close to you.
[Chuckles]
Is that right?
Yeah.
[Engine shuts off]
This place belongs to both of us.
No, it does not.
Everybody at school is asking me if my mother is the whore that slept with the president!
Rebel!
And I say yes.
Look. What if I can get you a hundred grand from my farm?
I told you 24 hours.
This is serious.
What I got going on is serious.
What do you got going on?
I can't be the miss perfect Annie and miss perfect Bonnie.
He did it. Both of you let him do it.
You're coming with me.
Hey, hey.
No! No! No!
