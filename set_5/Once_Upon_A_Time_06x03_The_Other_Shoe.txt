: I killed you.
: Did you really think it would be that easy?
: How do you like your gift?
: I should have known it came from you.
: The tremors, they come with visions.
: People are gonna tell you who you are your whole life. You just got to punch back, because there are no fairy godmothers in this world.
: Do we have a deal?
: You have to ask yourself... Is helping them exactly what causes your story to end?
 
: Give it to me.
: You're sure about this?
: You don't need Hyde's help. You have us. Fighting the Evil Queen is kind of what we do best.
: No offense, but this is
 the Evil Queen you remember. I crushed her heart, and somehow she's still alive. How is that possible?
: I... I don't know.
: I'm betting Hyde does.
: And you think
 gonna make him talk?
: Compared to the cup of noodles Nurse Ratched serves, my lasagna... is fit for a king.
: What the hell is all that?
: The Evil Queen.
: Yes, and from the looks of that, great minds really do think alike. Hmm. It's too bad she got here first with a better menu.
: What did she want?
: The same thing as you... information. I told her a great deal about my friends, but now... I'm sated. So the price of information has gone up.
: Oh, it's hard to try to stay one step ahead of yourself.
: Isn't it, Regina?
 
: Just finished signing in the last of the newcomers. I had everyone write down who they were traveling with so we can add up who's still out there.
: Huh.
: Clever boy.
: Emma! Hi!
: Ashley, hi! Hey, Alexandra! How are you? You guys want to sit down and join us?
: Oh, no, thank you. Thomas is just getting us some food to go, and I don't want to take up your time. I know you're busy, but with all these new people, I just... I thought that I should help somehow, and since I'm running the daycare, I figured why not offer them free babysitting. Anyway, I was hoping to maybe get a look at that list just to see who brought kids.
: Well, if you can understand these scribbles, then be our guest.
: Great.
: Someone new. Mom, want to come help?
: That's what I do, kid. I'll be right back.
: Excuse me, miss.
: Hey, would you mind distracting Alexandra while I take a look at this?
: I have no idea w...
: What's your doggy's name? Hey. You have to tell me about your doggy. What?
: Whoop! Blblblblblblblb! Ruff, ruff, ruff!
: That's quite the little charmer you've got there.
: Yeah, thanks to Emma. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have any of this. What about the two of you, anyway? Any chance of a fairy-tale ending?
: Uh, we're taking things slow. Quite slow, actually. I'm still sleeping on a cot on a pirate ship near a pregnant woman who likes to snore.
: I have a good feeling about you and Emma. Believe me... if I can get a happy ending, anyone can.
 
: Ella. Are you done cleaning yet?
: Not yet. I'm trying.
: You're failing.
: I don't see your daughters lifting a finger.
: If your father had left me with money for a proper staff, I wouldn't ask you to do such things. But unfortunately for both of us, he only left me with you.
: Out of the way, Ella! We have a guest!
: Good afternoon. I come with an invitation to the Royal Ball.
: And who in the world are
 We were expecting the Prince's butler.
: I'm the Prince's footman. But I can assure you the invitation is as good from my humble hands.
: "Humble" is one word for it. "Filthy" would be another.
: Girls, I've scraped and fought your whole lives for this... an invitation to the Royal Ball... and a chance to dig your claws into a prince.
 
: No. Not this one. No, not that one. I suppose I'll have to sell the porcelain and buy you something new for the ball.
: Do you think... maybe I could go?
: 
 You? And what would you wear? Your best rags?
: I do have one dress. It was my mother's favorite gown.
: Let me see that. Wretched. Clorinda.
: No! No!
: No!
: Oh, don't cry, Ella. They're just cinders.
: Oh, cinders on Ella. Cinder-Ella.
: It's perfect! Cinderella.
: Come. We have a ball to attend.
: Hello, Gus.
: That's funny. Mother used to tell me stories of a key exactly like this. She said that it was magic... that it could take you to another world... and you escape all your troubles. It's the Land of Untold Stories.
: It's too bad there's no such thing as magic.
 
: Archie! Oh.
: Sorry. I can come back later.
: Oh, no need. Um, we were just wrapping up.
: Wrapping up? I paid for an hour. We haven't even gotten to the work stuff. I mean, I'm stuck toiling in the mines and Dopey goes off and gets his master's degree? Now I got to pick up his slack? He's flirting with coeds.
: I thought Dopey was a tree.
: No, we got him out weeks ago.
: Really?
: Yeah. You think we sit around waiting for
 to do everything?
: 
 Um, y-you want to sit down?
: No.
: Last time you were here, you were worried about Regina.
: I don't want to talk about Regina.
: But you want to talk about something. Okay, well, that's good. That's... that's progress. Go on.
: You know that I'm not a jealous person.
: But?
: But... seeing Ashley today with her perfectly happy family...
: Made you jealous. Because... because you're not happy?
: No, because I
 happy and I know it's going away... that vision of my future. My number is up. And every time I think about it, then
 thing happens, and my magic goes away.
: The mind has a profound effect on the body. Whenever I get nervous, I get hives.
: My magic doesn't have hives. My magic is failing!
: 
 Okay. Um... let's just say it is, okay? Is that a reason to stop striving for what you want? Emma, any day, I-I could walk out that door and I could get hit by a bus, but that hasn't stopped me from walking out the door.
: This is not about a bus. It's very hard to keep this secret from my family. Like Hook and me, we should be living together. He wants to, I want to. Hook's waiting for me to ask him.
: So why don't you?
: Because he deserves a future and I can't give that to him. I feel like a fraud. This happiness is an illusion. I went and fought for everybody else's happy endings, and then... I don't get mine.
: Emma, maybe it's not about how you end things. Maybe it's about how you live them.
 
: Emma!
: Thomas, you all right?
: It's Ashley. I went to drop Alex home, and she wasn't there, but I found this.
: "Clorinda was on the newcomer list. "She's in Storybrooke, and I have to find her before it's too late"?
: Clorinda was, uh, well, uh, I guess you'd call her the evil stepsister.
: Do you think she's gonna hurt Ashley?
: More like the other way around. My hunting rifle is missing.
: Wait. You think that Cinderella's gonna kill her stepsister?
: Some scars don't heal, you know? Where are you going?
: To find her.
: How?
: The way you find Cinderella.
: With her shoe.
 
: So, your little science experiment can really tell us why the Evil Queen is still alive and how to destroy her?
: It's a possibility if I can re-create the serum that split you.
: Sorry. I need my lab, my equipment. It's a world away.
: Well, in this world, we don't give up so easily. Come on, there's got to be something else inside we can use.
: He's as useless as his other half.
: Regina, he's trying to help.
: I know. I'm just... I'm sick of being one step behind her.
: So get a step ahead. She thinks like you. Try thinking like her.
: Fine. I used to be good at this.
: When you want to tear families apart, you... you look for the cracks that are already there. Like Zelena and me. I have to talk to my sister.
: Hey. We will find a way to defeat the Evil Queen. We always do.
: Is this our life now... just defeat and repeat? I just want things to be normal someday.
: What does normal even look like?
: Well... 
 it might sound crazy, but for 28 years, things were normal.
: When we were cursed?
: There was a downside.
: I liked teaching.
: That was Mary Margaret.
: And why can't a princess be a teacher? What's more noble than that? I'd like to teach again. Is that crazy?
: That... is the most normal thing I've heard in a long time.
: What?
: I think I have a way to help Jekyll.
 
: Oh. 
 Swan, see that parry? Think he's finally getting the hang of it.
: Uh, yeah. What are you doing here, Henry?
: Hook told me you two were going to find Ashley. I thought I could help.
: Was this your idea? Some sort of a weird "pirate teaches him how to be a man" thing?
: No, this was all his idea. He said it was a... well, what did you call it? Mother-son bonding.
: Ah, yes.
: All right. Operation Cobra Part Two. Every shoe belongs to a foot. And this one will take us right to her.
 
: Look at this, Gus. Isn't it amazing? Whatever I owe Rumplestiltskin for, it is worth it.
: I hope so. I've heard other mice tell terrible tales about him.
: Well... whatever else he might be, for tonight, he's my fairy godmother. Father. 
 Whatever. Thanks to him, I have this dress, glass slippers... and all... this.
: It's free cheese. Go. 
 Have fun.
: Oh!
: I am so sorry! Did I tear your dress? If I did, I'll sew it up myself!
: It's okay. Really, it's okay. I'm Snow White.
: Ella.
: Nice to meet you, Ella.
: I feel terrible about your dress.
: Don't. I stopped worrying about dresses a long time ago. I'm not your typical princess. But I get the feeling neither are you.
: Oh, no, I'm not. I'm not a princess at all. I'm just an ordinary girl playing dress-up for a night.
: Well, I don't think you're ordinary. And apparently, neither does he.
: Is that...? The Prince.
: Don't worry. They're not all as stuffy as you think.
: You think he could be charming?
: Oh, that name's taken. 
 Go.
: It appears Princess Snow wants us to converse.
: Yeah, she thought you were...
: Staring? Was it that obvious?
: Then I apologize. But I could tell there was something different about you, and that was before I saw those glass shoes of yours. Wherever did you get them?
: You wouldn't believe me if I told.
: A girl with mystery. I like that.
: But can you dance in them?
: I can try.
: Would it be too bold if I asked your name?
: I thought you liked a mystery.
: Then a mystery it shall be. The girl with the glass slippers. You're not from this world, are you?
: Is that bad?
: It's wonderful.
: If you'll excuse me, I have a quick piece of business, but I'll return. Don't go anywhere.
: Oh. Thank you. I'm so excited.
: Do you know who they're laughing at? They're laughing at you. Do you really think he would choose you over her?
: But he... but he danced with me.
: He was making fun of you, dear. You're so obviously a serving girl. Look at that garish blue dress. He made you into a joke. And everyone here knew it. Except you.
 
: Hello, Sheriff. Thought you would be on patrol right now.
: Where'd you get this?
: This was my father's coin. I need to know if his death was really an accident. So, what do you say we skip right to the part where you offer me a deal?
: Well, I do like candor. Almost as much as I like deals. So... yes, the coin was mine for a time. And lucky for you... I'm a stickler for records. Here we are.
: Name your price.
: Now you're talking. But I must warn you, the more desperate the man, the higher the price, and you seem... quite desperate. So I'll have to ask you. How badly do you want a deal?
 
: Gus, what are you doing? Right! Mother's key. She said it was magic. Maybe...
: What are you doing?
: I'm leaving.
: No! You can't leave.
: What do you care?! When you marry the Prince, you won't need me anymore.
: No, no, no, you have got this all wrong. The Prince loves
: What?
: You're the girl in the glass slipper. He's out there right now searching the entire kingdom for
: You're making fun of me again. I saw him give you that rose.
: It's because I'm getting married, but not to the Prince. To his footman, Jacob. The Prince was only passing along a message.
: The footman? But... you were so cruel to him.
: Mother would never let me marry a footman. And so I... put on an act. Like I've done most of my life. I am so sorry, Ella. For everything. But we have both been her prisoner. And tonight, I can finally escape.
: Where are you going?
: I'm going to meet Jacob at the guard tower at the Prince's castle, and we are gonna ride far away and start a little farm together.
: 
: And I am never coming back.
: You know your mother will hunt you down wherever you go. I have an idea.
 
: Ashley! What are you doing?!
: Go away!
: We're your friends. Why are you threatening us?
: Look, I don't want to hurt you. There's just something I have to do just as soon as I figure out where my sister's hidden herself.
: We cannot let you hurt her.
: Hurt her? No, you've got it all wrong. I'm not trying to hurt Clorinda. I'm trying to
 her.
: Why? She's your wicked stepsister.
: You don't know the real story. In the end, Clorinda wasn't the wicked sister. I was.
: So you did something bad. We've done a lot of bad things. A long time ago, I told you if people saw you a certain way, you had to punch back and show them who you are. If you see yourself a certain way, punch back and see yourself differently. You can change. You can fix this. Whatever it is, I will help you.
: No, but that's the thing. You just said it. 
 have to throw the punch. That's why I came out here alone. You can't do it for me this time. Do you know how it feels when you know all your happiness is a lie?
: Yeah. I do.
: Swan? Swan, stop her! Use your magic!
: I can't.
: Hey.
: I'm sorry. I can't.
: Hey. It's okay.
 
: I just need to know if the Evil Queen was here.
: Shh! You're gonna wake Robin.
: That rattle.
: She
 here!
: 
 Okay, fine. She was here.
: Well, you have to give that back.
: Our mother's rattle? The only family heirloom I have?
: There are strings attached.
: I'm a big girl. Stop judging me.
: I'm not trying to judge you. I am trying to save you.
: Save
 You're the one that needed saving so badly, you ripped yourself in half. So if you're gonna blame anyone here, blame yourself.
 
: It's still happening. I thought the Cricket was helping you.
: I thought so, too.
: Having a little trouble with your magic?
: Stay away from my mom.
: Henry. Now, is that any way to speak to your
 mother?
: You're not my mother.
: Well, sure I am. I raised you. I helped you with your homework. I packed your lunches. Regina and I may have split, but I am as much your mother as she is. Now stop slouching. Posture is self-respect, and if you don't have it, no one else will give it to you.
: Henry, hey. Don't listen to her.
: Says the woman who was never around.
: You're right. I was never around, and I owned that. You're just the worst part of Regina.
: Am I? Or am I the part that is honest about myself? You see, Regina never had her happy ending because she's never been strong enough to let her story run its course. I won't make that mistake, mnh-mnh, for myself... or our new arrivals.
: What about those people? What do you want with them?
: Patience. You just wait until those untold stories play out. But here's a little spoiler. Cinderella's story won't end well.
: Why would you want to hurt Ashley?
: I don't. I want to hurt
 I want you to see how pointless you are.
: I saved her once. I'll save her again.
: Oh, that's the tragic thing about being a savior. You have to keep saving people. But once you're off the chessboard... everything falls apart. All those happy endings turn to dust, and your entire life means... nothing. Let me show you what it feels like.
 
: Where the hell are we?
: She took us off the chessboard.
 
: 
: David, hi. Come in. Do you, uh... want to sit down?
: Oh, no, no, no, no, thanks. I'll... I'll stand.
: What, uh... what brings you here?
: Nothing much. I have something for you. From your husband.
: I have no idea what it says. I'm just the messenger.
: You? A messenger? What did you need from him?
: He has information about my father. About his death.
: And you had to make a deal to get it? Sounds like my husband.
: There. You can, uh... you can say I took it. And I'm sorry. I'm sure it must not have been easy growing up without your father.
: It was. Of course, it wasn't easy when he was there, either. Drunk and sad. 
: Mm. I guess it's hard to say which is worse for some fathers.
: Gone. It was worse having him gone.
: Fathers and sons. It's hard for you, I think. 'Cause no matter what the damage to the relationship, you need each other.
: Hmm.
 
: Ashley was my first save. You take that away, then what? Everything I've done can be undone?
: By the Evil Queen? No, no, no. My Emma's too strong for that. Look, we can worry about the big picture later. Right now the little picture's saying that we have to go, magic or no magic.
: Go where? Back to where Ashley left us? She's not there. She's charging into who knows what, and if the Evil Queen wants it to play out, it's not good.
: Then we figure out where she's headed next. You didn't used to have magic and you found people.
: He's right. Just imagine that you're back in your old life as a bails bonds-person... woman. How did you find people then?
: Try to think like the skip thinks and get inside their head. Why are they running? What is their story? Who do they love?
: Their story. Ashley said she was trying to help her stepsister, uh, Camilla?
: Calinda?
: Ca... uh.
: Calinda.
: Callista.
: I thought it was Calinda.
: It's Clorinda. Ashley blames herself for her not getting her happy ending. If the book says what her ending was supposed to be, then that's a clue we need. Yes! It's in here. Look.
 
: Clorinda, where are you?
: What's going on?
: Clorinda. She's run off with the footman!
: I-I don't know where she's gone, but... but maybe it won't matter. The Prince is looking for me. He liked me. You know, maybe if I married well, Clorinda could do whatever she wanted.
: The Prince isn't gonna marry you. He isn't even gonna recognize you.
: Of course he'll recognize me.
: Officially? Will the people officially recognize you? You look like a trash bin and have the education of my cat. Of course, if you had proof... it would be hard to deny you.
: Look what we have here.
: Okay. Okay. You want to know where Clorinda is. I get it! But the shoe isn't that important.
: Oh, yes, it is. It's your proof. It's crucial. Now, where's my daughter?
: The guard tower!
: No!
: Careful in here. Glass can cut.
 
: It's been a long time.
: Clorinda. I've been searching everywhere, and then I realized you might figure to come here. You're hurt. I am so sorry. This is all my fault, but I'm going to fix our story. I just hope that someday you can forgive me.
: I can't. And neither can she.
: It's too late for that, Cinderella.
 
: Let me out!
: No one's here.
: I may be a princess, but I know how to track. This is where she came.
: Hey! I'm up here!
: I'm here!
: Then she must be gone. Let's keep looking.
 
: Told ya!
: It
 you. Why did you run away?
: I'm so sorry about that, and just... and everything. I never should've even come to the ball. I didn't... I didn't mean to mislead you. And... and she broke it, so there's... there's no proof, and... and I totally understand if your people want you to go with someone else...
: Why would they want someone else?
: Because I'm no one.
: Nonsense. I know you have a name.
: Ella.
: Well, if you'll allow me, I'd like to change that. To Princess Ella.
: Will you?
: Y-Yeah. 
 Yes, of course!
: Thank you, Princess Snow. Now, let's go to the palace. I'll wake the royal glass blower. You need new shoes.
: That sounds lovely. But there's something I need to fix first.
 
: A key?
: It's magic. It makes any door lead to the Land of Untold Stories. It would pause our lives, but we could be together.
: To the Land of Untold Stories.
: Mm-hmm.
: 
 No! No! No!
: "No"?
: You'll kill him!
: But, darling, that's the idea.
: Stop! Get away from her!
: Cinderella. You told her where we'd be? You filthy little rat.
: I'm sorry, but look. Thomas found me. We're engaged.
: And you came here to what? To rub it in our faces?
: No.
: This is so unfair. I've pulled myself through life for 50 years now, and every year I keep pulling, and when it's finally my turn to rest, this girl who I've carried like a... like a scab on my soul, she gets it all and I get nothing? No.
: Mother, what are you doing?
: I'm pausing. Perhaps when the world makes sense again, I'll come back and get what's owed to me. And you, my dear, you are coming with me. The footman can find someone at his own level.
 
: Clorinda, listen to me.
: Quiet.
: I was trying to help you and Jacob find your happiness back in the Enchanted Forest, and maybe you could get that here.
: Jacob? He's here?
: He's been in Storybrooke the whole time. Isn't... that why you came here to his farm?
: True enough. And here's the man himself.
: Jacob!
: This little patch of filth is his. See, I discovered my own fairy godmother here... the Evil Queen. She's helping me find the missing pieces of my betrayal. Time to finish an old job.
: Leave him alone! Ella, you said you would fix this!
: Stop, please.
: No. I wanted to be the one taken care of for once.
: You're in pain. Okay? But you don't get to put that off on Clorinda or Jacob! She's paid enough!
: No!
: You really think I won't shoot you? I suppose you're right. This is a coward's weapon, anyway. Not nearly personal enough.
: 
: Oh!
: Ashley! Oh! Thank God we found you.
 
: No.
: This needs magic.
: Mom. You can do it.
: 
: I am so sorry for what I did.
: It's all right.
: You did it, Swan.
 
: Here we are.
 
: Told you I could help you, Doctor.
: Oh, my, yes. This is exactly what I need.
: Just whose garage are we in, anyhow?
: That would be mine. Please, help yourself to any of the equipment, but, um, steer clear of the refrigerator. It's not food in there.
: 
 Whale.
: Whale? Whale is my curse name, Dr. Jekyll. I did most of my best work as Frankenstein.
: Oh, yes. It's an honor, Doctor. An honor. Uh, we must begin at once.
: Dr. Jekyll and Dr. Frankenstein. You know what that sounds like?
: The world's scariest-sounding pediatrician's office.
: 
 That and a really first-rate high-school science faculty. I mean, after we're done, we could have all this equipment moved to the classrooms, could put these guys to work teaching. It's all part of getting this town back to normal.
 
: Put some back into it, sister.
: She really was brave... Ashley.
: Putting love before life.
: Exactly.
: Move in with me.
: What?
: Move in with me. I know everything in life is uncertain, but sometimes you have to walk out the door and hope there's not a bus.
: 
: I mean... I have a closet full of red jackets. I feel like I could make some space for some black leather.
: Well, when you put it like that, then I would love to move in with you.
 
: You're still up? What's going on?
: Yeah. I have this... Gold gave me this. It's about the coin. A shepherd... found it in the wreckage of a cart.
: 
 Your father. What a terrible reminder. I'm sorry.
: There's more to it. This man, my father, he'd been stabbed. He wasn't killed in the accident. He wasn't drunk.
: That's good news. He didn't betray you. He kept his word.
: That means his killer could still be out there.
: Don't do this. Don't think about who did it. Just let it go. Let us live our lives. I'll teach, you'll be sheriff.
: Isn't this what a sheriff does?
: No, no, no. What you're contemplating is vengeance, not justice, and we don't need vengeance. We have this town and our daughter and our son who really needs you. It may not be epic, but it is the most important thing you will ever do, and it won't happen if you're off seeking revenge for some decades-old crime.
: Being there for Neal... how could that not be epic? Of course it's where I want to be.
: Good. Come to bed.
: You know what? I'm just gonna burn this. That way I don't even have to think about it.
 
: 
 
: It's not fair. Even now the Savior wins.
: Yes, but for how long?
: Don't tell me to be patient. Right now, your pathetic half is working on a way to destroy
: My sympathies.
: I'm not asking for your sympathy.
: No, you're asking for my help.
: And that's a tall order to fill... from inside this cell, milady.
: Well, in that case. Let's take a walk.
