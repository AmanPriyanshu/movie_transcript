Tomorrow morning, the sun rises at 6:17 a.m., at which time we will leave the house so we are first in line for the most important day of our lives.
Maya, they're just tacos.
What?
Is it necessary that we are first in line?
I would regard not being first in line as my greatest personal failure since not understanding fractions.
They're just parts of a number.
Well, parts? When would I ever need numbered parts?
How many tacos are you having?
Eight isn't enough, but nine is too many.
There's no solution.
Yeah.
Okay, we took our showers and put on our clothes for tomorrow, so we're all ready to go when the sun comes up.
(Squeak)
Barry-the-Bear Bear's excited too.
I love you, Barry.
Okay, we are all set to go, so nothing can go wrong.
Will there be any stops in Rileytown?
Sir, no, sir!
Where will the only stop be?
Paco's Tacos!
For their...
25th Anniversary 25-cent Tacopalooza!
Who else would get this crazy?
Tacos! Tacos!
Tacos!
How many ya want?
Eight-and-a-half.
(Door slams shut)
Okay, tell me the rules. One.
I will not fall and break something and have to go to the hospital.
Two.
I will spend as little time in the hospital as possible.
Three.
I will not check my phone or read a story about a three-legged puppy and become inconsolable.
What, does he just fall over or what?
(Festive Mexican horns play)
25-cent Tacopalooza all day tomorrow while supplies last!
First 10 customers get a Paco Taco Bobblehead.
(Raspy) I want that bobblehead.
Okay. We'll get it.
I want it.
It's a bobble... I'm gonna get it?
Okay. You're gonna get it.
You're gonna get the bobblehead.
I'm gonna get it.
(Both laugh)
(Pastoral music playing)
(Birds twittering)
Go, go, go, go, go!
Wait!
No!
Something's...
No!
Wrong.
(Groans)
(Gasps) Barry-the-Bear Bear!
He's gone!
Come on, that stupid bear has been hanging on by a thread for years!
How is this a problem?
I've had him all of my life, Maya.
Where is he? We have to find him.
Barry.
Bobblehead.
(Theme music playing)
(Air horn blares)
Matthews family emergency!
Move! Move, move, move!
(Screaming)
Everybody out of the house in under 10 seconds!
Yes!
Riley, Maya, why are you girls still inside?
Everybody out of the house in under 10 seconds except for them. Yes!
Is this an actual emergency?
: Yes!
Even if it's not, Momma loves a practice drill.
Did you get my tacos?
No.
Why not?
Barry-the-Bear Bear is missing!
Ah, that bear has been hanging on by a thread for years.
Everybody knows this.
Riley, why can't you just look for Barry-the-Bear when you get back?
Oh, sure. He's just missing.
It's your day. I'm sorry. Let's go, go, go, go, go.
You sure you're okay?
I'm sure I'm not okay.
The last thing I said to him was, "I wish you were a Slinky."
Riley, he'll show up.
It's not really a big deal.
Attaboy. Let's see what happens now.
"Not a big deal"?
I messed up. I messed up.
A teddy bear is a source of joy and comfort and security and love.
Barry was my childhood.
Everything I went through, he went through.
My childhood is missing.
(Knock on door)
What are you guys doing here?
We were told there would be tacos.
Three tacos please.
Uh, may I have pancakes?
You called them here?
I invited them here.
I wanted them to know what it's like to want a taco and not get a taco.
What could be worse than that, you...
(Festive Mexican horns play)
So... we're all here to look for your childhood teddy bear that Auggie chewed the face off of?
Oh boy.
Will we never let that go?
♪ I love Riley ♪

♪ And Riley loves me ♪
(Squeak)
(Running footsteps)
Can I play?
Did someone say something?
Pay attention to me!
Why should we pay attention to you when we can pay attention to him?
Oh, yeah? (Growls)
(Screams)
(Screams)
(Screams)
I was remembering too hard.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I was just a little kid.
I ate anything that got in my way.
Auggie, it wasn't very nice to eat Riley's bear.
And in fact, you would think in doing that, that would teach Riley not to eat someone's cookie.
Get off that.
I do not wish to.
That bear's been nothing but trouble for me my whole life.
I just wanted you to play with me.
I didn't do this.
Oh, yeah?
Then where were you the evening of the 15th?
I was out of town on business.
He didn't do it, guys.
You know what? If this means this much to my daughter, let's respect her feelings.
Let's find that stupid, faceless bear.
Y... you know, I... I would, but I... I got that big game with, uh, s... s... sports. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, and I would too, but I got the, you know, the big... big science fair with, uh...
I don't know.
Why did you two switch characters?
We panicked!
We're gonna be trapped in here looking for a stuffed animal!
We'll do anything to get out of it.
I know. Who's up for a taco?
You lost! Now get off of me.
Well, I'll stick around here as long as it takes because I am a supportive friend.
Hey, Riley, what about just this once, I can be the unsupportive friend?
Absolutely.
Live your lives.
(Door opens)
Oh, but before you go, one quick story.
Hey, a story.
Once upon a time, there was a little, tiny Riley, and she was given a bear.
Sweetie, I know you don't feel good, but Mom and Dad have to go to work.
Please don't go.
(Cory chuckles)
Mrs. Svorski's in the other room, and we have someone else to keep you company too.
Look. It's a teddy bear.
But I want you.
We know, honey.
But when you look at this bear, it's like we're looking right back at you.
So, it's like we're with you all day.
And when you hug Barry, it's just like you're hugging us.
No.
Oh.
Bye.
(Door opens)
Bye, honey.
(Squeaks)
And the little girl loved the little bear for the rest of her little life.
Whoa! Great story!
That was so good. Guys, let's go.
(Both sniffling)
Oh no.
We have to find that bear, you guys.
Oh no.
(Festive Mexican horns play)
I don't think there's anybody in New York City that doesn't have one of Paco's Tacos!
You're wrong, Paco!
We have to find that bear, you guys.
How is it possible that I can end up in a situation like this?
♪ Doo, doo, doo ♪

♪ Doodily, doodily, doo ♪
Hi. I'm Maya.
Let's be friends forever no matter what.
Okay.
Like that.
Get outta here.
(Girls giggle)
You find anything?
No.
And I really want to do this for Riley because it will make up for biting his face off.
What's this?
Ooh, what are these silver mittens?
Oh, my gosh.
Auggie, let me see those.
Do you know what these are?
These are my dad's silver boxing gloves.
I thought I lost these again.
Again?
Well, he won them in the Navy.
He gave them to me, and... the first thing I did was lose 'em.
Shouldn't they be important to you?
They were.
But you know what? Kids lose stuff.
But he wanted me to have something that meant so much to him.
That's what was important.
Not the thing itself, but that he gave them to me.
Time to pass them on to your son now?
Believe me, Auggie, you do not want this kind of responsibility.
True. The crushing weight of the bear has already messed me up for life.
(Chuckles)
Good.
Come here.
Hey.
Hey.
Do you remember when I first got here and everybody was washing the car?
You sat next to me on that bucket, you talked to me, I talked back to you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you remember how you were very nice to me but you didn't really know me, but you sat next to me and talked to me anyway?
Yeah. Did... did I say anything important?
Didn't matter what you said.
It was that you sat there next to me.
That time where I was feeling like an outsider, I remember that.
I appreciated that.
Okay.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure. (Chuckles) Oh, yeah.
I heard you used to be quite the wacko.
Oh. I had my moments.
I heard you were a hippie-dippie child of the universe.
I like to think I was my own person.
How come you're not like that anymore?
Well, she's definitely still a part of me, but I just think that as we grow, whoever it is we used to be just become a part of our... scrapbook.
How can you be sure you're growing in the right way?
Well, I don't know, Mr. Turtleneck, Mop-Top, Farkle Time, Donnie Barnes.
Do you miss any of those people?
They all got me to where I am now. I...
I guess they're part of my scrapbook too.
Like Riley's teddy bear. That's why we're looking for it so hard?
I don't know, Farkle.
Why are we all looking so hard for the last ripped up, raggedy piece of Riley's childhood?
Maybe I'm not quite ready for it to be gone.
Lucas?
Do you have anything from when you were a kid that you still hold on to?
One thing. It's kind of dumb though.
What is it?
When I was like four years old, my Pappy Joe gave me something called a sack of gold.
It was a little canvas bag and it had drawstrings to open it.
Lucas, are we rich?
(Chuckles)
I thought so.
(Chuckles)
I kept it for years.
Then one day, I saw that Zay had his own little sack of gold too.
And I said, "Hey, Zay, you got a sack of gold?"
And he said, "Yeah."
And he opened it up, poured the whole thing in his mouth, chewed it, and blew a bubble.
It was bubblegum?
Yes. His was.
Yours was real gold?
Yes. I believed it was.
And I still believe it is.
'Cause I am never gonna open it up to find out any different.
It's funny about these things we hold on to.
And how life lets us know when it's time to let it go.
Yeah.
Sometimes it's just a little bag of bubblegum.
But if the right person gives it to you, then it's gold.
Life, we need to talk.
Here I am on taco day, no taco whatsoever.
Would you care to explain yourself in your mysterious ways?
Hey, family! Don't try to pressure me into staying for dinner.
I'm just here to do my laundry.
That's right. That's a thing now.
I do my laundry here. Did you know?
'Cause now you know.
My brother!
My laundry!
His laundry!
(Screams)
I'm sorry. I lost my mind.
I will just take these to the creek and I will wash them myself.
What's everybody doing? Who's here?
: Who do you most want to be here?
Maya.
Josh.
Long game?
Long game.
We're looking for Riley's lost teddy.
Barry-the-Bear Bear?
She's had that thing forever.
You lost it?
Yeah, but I think I'm ready to call Barry officially lost and head out for tacos.
No. Really? No.
No, no giving up.
Yes, give up. Yes.
No, it's important we find it.
Why?
(Footsteps)
Uncle Josh!
Mr. Auggie.
How's college?
Oh, dude, you kidding?
Dude, you kidding?
Dude, the people, the parties, you kidding, dude?
You want to stay here tonight?
Just a night? How about forever?
Has it been a rough adjustment?
It was a rough adjustment for us in high school.
What about college?
You think you're ready.
You think you're ready.
What's the matter, honey?
I wasn't ready!
It's hard. I wasn't ready.
My roommate and I, we don't get along at all, And I don't think it's my fault. I think it's his fault.
He says "schnoop-aloop" at the end of everything.
Who does that? Now ask me a question.
What time is it?
11:15. Schnoop-aloop.
Ask me who I am.
Who are you?
I'm Schnoop-aloop's roommate.
You know what people say when they see me?
They say, "Hey, that's Schnoop-aloop's roommate."
My name is Josh.
How did this happen to me? I'll tell you how it happened.
I grew up. You know what I know?
High school is you last stop before you grow up.
So, you don't give up on that teddy bear.
You hang on tight. You find that bear.
You understand what's important, Riley?
Yeah, I think I do.
Lucas?
After you.
(Calliope music playing)
(Festive Mexican horns play)
Somebody just came and cleaned us out good!
We'll do it again in 25 years.
We looked everywhere. We can't find it.
I didn't think you would.
Why not?
Because I have a really strong feeling that it's supposed to be gone.
Where?
Wherever these things go.
How are we gonna tell Riley?
Hey, where is Riley?
She and Lucas were looking together.
Riley!
Yes?
Where have you guys been?
We haven't seen you in a half an hour.
An hour.
A half an hour.
I don't get it!
Riley found what we needed to find.
Yeah. Lucas and I found out that we were looking in the wrong place, so then we looked in the right place.
You found the bear?
No.
You find the bear?
No. Sorry.
Remember when Auggie wanted to give up Mr. Googly and grow up?
But then I didn't.
I wasn't ready.
Yeah. Good for you.
But at some point, I think we are ready.
How do we know when that is, Maya?
I think something inside us tells us.
I think it actually comes to tell us.
Riles...
I don't want to let you down, but I... think your bear is gone.
Yeah. I don't want to let you down either.
So, we got you this!
(Vocalizes festive Mexican horns)
: Tacos!
Riles!
Sorry I didn't realize sooner what was important, Maya.
So, I cried real hard.
You didn't have to cry. It's not that important.
Yeah, I did or else he wouldn't have given me one.
What?
Bobblehead!
Oh! Bobby, I will hold you tight and never let you go.
Yes, you will, and that'll be okay.
Thanks, Riles.
This is what's important.
Really? Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm completely sure what's gonna happen, but I'm gonna give 'em to you anyway.
I'll take care of this forever, Dad.
I know you'll try.
So, Riley, we're not gonna keep looking for the bear?
He knew it was time to go.
He knew that you didn't need him anymore.
So, he waited till you were asleep and kissed your eyelashes goodbye.
Grabbed his tiny travel hat and his little suitcase and he thanked you for your years together.
And he told me to tell you he forgave you for eating one of his cookies.
Then he hopped out the bay window and got on the G train to Beartown.
I think that's exactly what happened.
Thank you, everybody.
That's what we're here for.
Hey, Auggie?
Yeah?
It's a great story that you chewed his face off because you wanted to hang out with me and Maya.
Never lose that, okay?
Okay.
Can we hang out?
No. Get out of here.
You know what? I think it's time I got out of here.
What happened to forever?
I'll get your laundry.
Josh, you can stay here as long as you'd like.
Yeah, you can.
I know.
Thank you, but looking at you guys, I just get this feeling that there's some good friends to be made back at my dorm.
With Schnoop-aloop?
Maybe Josh just needs to get to know him better.
Maybe I just need to let them get to know me a little bit better.
Yeah. You know, you're not a bad guy at all.
Oh, yeah?
Thank you, Zay.
: You're welcome.
And I'm glad that you and Maya decided that you might be right for each other someday and you'll fly to the moon and all that.
: Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Very sophisticated.
Now here's what I was thinking back here on Earth.
Hey, Maya, uh... Lucas and Riley are gonna be going out on dates and holding hands and all scared to death... and Lucas isn't gonna think anything at all about ditching one of his best friends...
I'm not ditching...
You abandoned me for her.
Okay.
(Chuckles)
And if you really care about her like you say, then you don't want to see her thinking so much about later that she misses now. Do you?
No.
What do you have in mind?
Yeah, what do you have in mind?
You helped me not feel like an outsider.
There's a lot that's probably gonna happen to us, and I'll probably be stupid.
But... what's not stupid is you and her.
And I never want you to feel like a third wheel when...
Lucas and Riley are gazing into each other's stupid, stupid eyes.
So, I want you to know that I'd be happy to sit next to you, next to Riley and Lucas, at the movies, so we could all be together.
That all right with you? I don't care.
Is that all right with you?
Well, I think that's up to Maya.
Till next time?
Till next time.
You want to go to the movies?
No.
Yes.
Uck!
Want to go to the movies?
I just like sitting next to you.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Thank you for asking.
You want to go to the movies?
What?
