Previously on "Too Close to Home"...
What the hell are you guys doing?
Teaching him a lesson.
Really good job.
He's alive.
He saved him.
Can he be transported?
We can't take him.
We have two other calls out this way.
We have to take them by priority.
She's screwing the president.
They were having an affair, yes. And who are you to her?
Her mother.
Hi.
Where's Victor.
What's wrong?
You're what's wrong.
Who's this?
I don't know his name.
Look here, you back-wooded country-ass bitch.
Valerie.
Shut up. I have friends in the justice department.
So if he's been here and you are keeping that from us I swear I'll have the FBI in here so fast that...
Folks around here do not like your type.
He's been beat up something pretty bad.
By who?
Well, we're... we're looking into that.
Brody.
Is Brody seeing anybody?
No.
♪♪
Hello? What the hell? Are you going to hello?
(KNOCKING)
Hello?
Who's there?
Anna.
Hello?
Annie?
Your sister?
No.
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)
Hello?
Hi. Is Victor here?
Who are you to him?
He's his boyfriend.
Yeah. He's upstairs.
May I?
Yeah.
First door on the right.
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm fine.
Hey. I'm okay.
Oh my God.
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Victor.
I'm okay.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Yeah.
Damn it.
I'm fine.
Look at you.
Damn it, Dax. I'm fine.
I told you not to come here.
I'm okay.
You gave us quite a scare.
Who did this to you?
Some good old boys.
They may be a lot of things but good isn't one of them, Victor.
I need you guys to calm down.
I'm fine.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
I'm going to get you out of here and to a real doctor.
They patched me up.
They did a really good job.
We need to get you out of here.
Okay?
Dax, I'm fine.
He shouldn't be moved right now.
I don't care.
I'm getting him on a plane to a hospital.
He had a collapsed lung.
He shouldn't be on a plane.
Are you a doctor?
No.
Then how do you know that?
I know the pressure from an airplane is not a good thing.
OK, but what if he's got internal bleeding or something from what these assholes did to him?
The paramedics checked him out.
They said he's fine.
Then why did they not transport him to a hospital?
They had a more traumatic emergency.
They said he's fine.
This is crazy.
Valerie, don't.
Don't blame us. *
You made me so mad.
You're always mad.
It's not his fault.
I'm sorry, Victor.
It's okay, Anna.
No, it's not.
Did you know we got fired.
Did you know that?
No, I didn't.
Valerie?
No, Dax. Because of you, we lost our jobs, Anna.
We don't know that.
Why else would they tell us not to come back to the White House the day after she sleeps with the president?
Valerie.
The press haunts us.
Ever since you brought them back to his place.
All day and all night.
They follow us like we did it.
I'm sorry, Valerie.
Save it.
Hey.
I don't want to hear it.
Valerie, stop it.
Now is not the time.
: Valerie, he's right.
Now is not the time.
You know what? I need some air.
Thank you for taking care of him.
Can we have a moment alone, please?
: Take as much time as you need.
Annie? I'm sorry, honey.
Don't. Don't be. Don't be.
Okay.
Can I get you something?
No. No. I'm fine.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bonny was telling me you're going to be in town for a while.
Yeah. Maybe.
Good.
It'll be good having you back here.
Yeah.
: Yeah.
I'm gonna walk back to the trailer, okay?
Yeah, I'm going to get my purse. I'll take you, okay, hon?
No, no. I'm just going to walk.
Why would you do that?
I'm taking you home.
Because, it's...
Because it's a nice day and I just want to clear my head.
Okay.
But I'd feel more comfortable if I could drive you.
I can take care of myself.
There are dangerous people walking around now.
Bonnie...
I'm taking you home, Annie.
All right?
Okay.
I'm gonna, uh... Where's the restroom?
It's around the corner, under the stairs.
You still love her.
No, I don't.
Yeah, you do.
Bonnie, I just want you.
No.
I'm looking straight through you, Brody.
No, you're not.
You're only seeing what you want to see.
Not what I'm feeling.
We shouldn't have done this.
I don't have no regrets when it comes to you except that you won't be mine.
My bed is still warm from your brother.
Half-brother. And isn't that over?
I'm not doing this to Annie, Brody.
What about what you're doing to us?
This is me and you, Bonnie.
You've been saying that since we started.
(WHISPERING) I don't want to talk about this right now.
So you're going to push me away?
I wasn't expecting this.
I miss you. I'm not sad that it happened.
I'm not doing this with you again.
So you're going to push me away?
I don't know what to do.
We can't do this.
Don't you understand?
You love me.
All right? The only reason you were into J.B. was because it was convenient.
What?
You can't handle someone loving you the right way and someone not treating you like trash?
You are going to break my heart, Brody.
Why do you keep saying that?
Because you are.
I will never break your heart.
Yes, you will.
You always say that.
You're a better person than I am.
And you punish me because I'm good.
Don't you realize how insane that is?
Yeah.
I do.
But I have to go.
Go.
I'm sorry.
Just leave.
Please, don't be mad at me.
Go!
Why are you still standing here?
I just wanna sit with your daddy, and help ***.
Get your purse and go.
I don't know what's going on. Have you seen...
You'll be fine. Okay?
(SIGHS)
We'll find him.
Oh, god. There's J.B., I mean... *
Uh, maybe * he'll help us.
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
What are the police doing here?
Hey, J.B.
We can't find Horace.
J.B., have you seen Horace?
Horace? No. Uh, no, no, I haven't seen him.
Well, he hasn't come home.
When was the last time you talked to him?
Late Wednesday.
I mean, I don't know what's going on.
Alright Sarah, just calm down. We'll find him.
Okay? We'll find him, honey.
Where in the hell could he be?
Well, I don't... I don't know.
Might be laid up over there with Debra in ***.
I'll send a deputy over there.
Yeah, that's a... that's a good idea.
If her husband found him over there...
Ow! *** Ain't no telling.
Uh?
Yeah.
Look, we need to talk.
About?
That kid that y'all beat up.
Sheriff Mobley, I don't...
No, you and Tanner need to go in there and turn yourself in.
I don't have time to think about some...
Alright?
J.B., this is serious.
Yeah, what I have going on is serious.
What do you got going on?
I can't tell you that.
I'm not going to tell you, Mobley.
Look, you need to go to the station, all right?
I will.
When?
Look, I...
No, you don't understand, J.B., the feds are coming down here. You're going to take me down because I didn't put you in jail.
Look, I said that I would be there, OK?
Chill out.
Chill out.
(SNIFFS)
You cutting up your nose?
No.
You think I'm some sort of joke or something?
No, I don't.
I don't.
So you don't have my money?
I'm going to get it for you. I'll get you your money.
How are you going to get it?
I have a farm I own. You can have it.
Do I look like the type of guy that's in the real estate game?
No. I'm trying to find a solution here.
(STAMMERING)
You have 24 hours.
Yeah. I still have some more time.
Not much.
What if I can get you $100 grand from the farm.
I know the banker. It will take me three days.
He can't wait to get it off his hands.
I told you it was $250,000.
Please, give me more time. Please.
Please! Please give me some more time!
(RAVEN CAW)
So this is where you're from, huh?
Figures.
I don't want to fight with you right now.
Oh, I know you don't. And I'm glad.
Thank you.
Glad that I'll be getting the hell away from you.
Well, that makes two of us.
Oh, so the girl's got some balls now that she's in the backwoods where she grew up.
God I'm not in the mood for this right now.
Why?
Is it because all the lies you have been telling are starting to crumble?
Tell me, how does it feel, huh?
To know that every lie you have told us is being revealed like this.
You said your parents were rich.
I met your mother.
She damn for sure ain't rich.
She's disgusting.
You know what, you little?
Just shut up.
Okay, Valerie?
Or what?
What are you going to do?
Valerie.
I was your friend.
I was your friend, Anna. And you lied to me.
You betrayed me. Now my entire life is ruined because you're so damn selfish.
Valerie.
You never even apologized.
I said I'm sorry.
That's not an apology to me.
God.
We were so close.
And then you go out and do this and do not even tell me.
You're right, okay?
You're right. I'm selfish.
It was wrong what I did to you, to my family, to Brody.
I'm sorry.
And it is ripping me apart.
Look at Victor.
This is my fault and it's killing me, Valerie.
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
Yeah well, I don't forgive you.
Okay?
I can't even believe that you would be this selfish, and I not event know it.
God, you're not even like a woman.
You're like a dude who doesn't give a damn about anybody but themselves.
You need to get your life in order, Anna, before you end up alone.
I'm sorry.
Okay? I'm sorry.
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
Annie?
Let's go.
Who are you to her?
I'm her sister.
Well, that's good to know you still got one person that seems to care about you.
Careful with this one.
The moment she gets what she wants she's going to burn you.
She's like an evil dragon.
Trust me. She's going to destroy you.
You'll see.
You all right?
Yeah.
You sure?
You know she's right.
She's not right.
Come on, Bonnie. I'm not capable of caring for anyone.
That's not true, Annie.
Name one person that I love.
Me, I hope.
Oh yeah, of course.
And Rebel, Mama, Shelby.
Okay. Maybe I should have worded it differently.
Name one person that I love that I haven't hurt.
You know, sometimes we hurt the people we love the most.
Bonnie, I have hurt every single person that I love.
You're a good person, Annie.
I don't know about that.
Well, I do.
Did you see Brody's eyes the way he looked at me?
What do you mean?
He's still hurt by what I* did to him.
And I couldn't even look at him.
He's a good man, Annie.
He is.
You're right though.
He has changed.
Yeah.
He's not the little boy that I left.
He's a man now.
Yeah.
I see that.
So you're going to be sitting with his father?
Yeah, maybe.
Okay.
Would you like to do it?
No.
No, Bonnie. No.
You're the caretaker.
I would probably screw it up.
No, you wouldn't.
Yeah, I would.
But I do need to get a job. I need to help you guys out.
Yeah.
I'll get you a job at the diner.
Okay.
That would be nice.
What were you talking about when you said it's not good to walk down the streets of Happy.
There are just dangerous people around here now.
Why is that?
Bonnie?
You can't tell anybody about this. All right?
Bonnie?!
J.B.'s been running drugs.
I didn't know about it.
The people he took them from, they're real mad.
And they assaulted me.
Did you tell somebody?
No, I can't tell Mobley because he'll kill him.
Bonnie what did he do to you?
He choked me.
Bonnie!
This is not alright.
I know.
I just have to talk to J.B. and have him straighten it out.
Bonnie you need to tell somebody else besides J.B.
If not sheriff Mobley, somebody else.
I will.
Hey.
I'll talk to J.B. first...
Promise?
I promise.
Okay?
(IN A WHISPER) I promise.
Okay.
Let's get you home.
I'm sorry about my behavior earlier.
No problem.
I'm just really upset.
I can imagine.
So where's Dax?
He's still up there with him.
Okay, good.
I made coffee for y'all.
Want some?
Yeah. That'd be great.
There's cream right there if you want it.
Thanks.
You're shaking.
It's been a really rough week for me.
I can imagine.
So, how well do you know Anna?
Pretty well.
Has she always been like this?
Like what?
Liar, manipulator.
I don't know that to her.
What about selfish?
I went over to the trailer park where she lives.
Have you been over there?
Yeah.
You could say I have.
Sad and pathetic.
Yeah. We own it.
I'm sorry, but, it is.
Well, that's the best some folks around here can do.
You're right. But what I don't understand is why she had to lie about it.
She's always wanted more than what she saw around here.
I get it.
I still don't know why she had to lie about it. I'm her friend.
Sometimes people find themselves in situations where they don't feel worthy.
So they lie.
Just to make themselves feel adequate.
You don't sound like you're from around here.
Well, I am.
Born and raised.
That wasn't the answer I was expecting.
There are some sharp folks around here.
All right? Don't judge us all.
Some of us even went to a university.
Touché.
Did you?
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
What did you study?
Veterinary medicine.
Surprised you, didn't I?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was late getting started and late getting finished.
Then I had to come back here to take care of my mother, my father.
I'm sorry to hear that.
No.
It's love.
Do you see what I mean? You're not selfish.
You are a beautiful man.
Thank you.
When I walked in I thought I had died and gone to heaven and saw Jesus.
Lord.
I have heard that already this morning.
I'm just Brody.
Have you ever thought about modeling?
No.
No, I'm serious. I know people.
I could help you.
No, I'm fine.
Can't hurt.
I'm fine.
Okay. Well, let me know if you change your mind.
He's asleep.
How's he doing?
Says he's doing okay.
Good.
When do you think he's going to be able to travel.
Oh, man.
I don't know.
Okay.
Well, is there a hotel here?
Yeah. There's one in town, but you're more than welcome to stay here.
Oh, no.
We couldn't do that.
No, it's fine. You can.
You sure?
Yeah.
We have plenty of room. It's only me and my dad.
But I've got to tell you about him.
What?
He has dementia.
What?
Yeah.
Victor said he saved his life.
Yeah. It was a miracle that he did.
He came to his right mind long enough just to save him.
Wow.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Oh, my god.
Yeah. It was a miracle.
Yeah.
Thank you.
So if you don't mind, I keep an eye on him but he gets strange sometimes.
It's not a problem.
Strange?
Just make sure you lock your doors.
Lock your doors?
I'm starting to think maybe staying in a hotel might be better, Dax.
Can we afford it?
No, you're right. We can't.
You don't have to stay, Val.
I want to.
(HONKING)
Excuse me.
He is a Greek god.
Leave that man alone.
I think he wants me.
Who doesn't.
Come on. Let's go check on Victor.
All right.
Brody!
Brody!
What the hell you doing here?
I need to talk to you.
You can get out of here.
I need your help.
J.B.
Listen, man.
That man in there said you beat him half to death.
He's in here?
J.B.
Get him out of my house.
You get out of here.
Brody.
Now, damn it.
What the hell is he doing here?
I said leave.
Look, I need some money.
Well, I don't have any money.
Yes, we do.
No. We don't.
I need you to go to the bank with me and I need to put this house up.
That's not happening.
This place belongs to both of us.
No, it does not.
Mama left me her share.
My daddy has the other half.
Half of it's still mine.
Not as long as he's alive.
He's crazy.
Oh yeah, but he's alive.
I have the power of attorney and it ain't happening.
This place is worth $300,000.
I need half of it. I need it now.
I don't care.
Look, you don't get it, do you?
No. And I never will. All right.
You're not putting what my daddy worked his whole life for up at the bank.
Brody.
Get your ass out of here.
I'm getting tired of this.
Now! Get out of here.
You son of a bitch.
Get out of here!
Don't make me whoop your ass, J.B.
Get off my damn porch.
I'm in trouble, brother.
Yeah. You're damn right you are.
That man in there you beat, he's from D.C.
This is a federal crime what you did to him.
Get his ass out of my house.
J.B, get out of my house.
Get out of here.
And this is your last warning.
(PHONE BUZZING)
Yeah?
She's where?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm coming to get what's mine.
: You still here?
: Told you she would be.
: You happy now?
What?
Everybody at school is asking me if my mother is the whore that slept with the president.
Rebel!
And I say yes, yes she is.
Rebel, stop. Get in the house.
I'm not going back in.
You go back in the house right now.
Don't talk to your mama that way.
What's wrong with you?
: How you doing, Rick.
Damn, Annie.
Shelby, come home, okay?
: How are you?
Let's go Shelby.
She's not going anywhere with you.
Whoa, hold on now. I just came by to see if you could loan me some money.
I don't have no money for you.
Then I'm going with him.
Get out of here.
You're not going with him. You're staying here.
Why?
Because I said so.
Oh, you said so?
I don't want to hear it, Shelby.
You don't want to hear it?
Shut your mouth.
Don't tell me to shut my mouth.
Is that funny to you?
Get the hell out of here right now, and don't ever come back.
Okay!
Rick!
Just call me.
Keep going!
What the hell you run him off for?
Go in the house right now.
What the hell did I do?
Is this about J.B?
I sure didn't do what she did.
Were you with Victor last night?
Look who's talking to me now.
I haven't seen you for years and  you can't say hi.
He almost got beat to death and I think you had something to do with it.
And?
Well you're still the same Shelby.
And you're still the same Annie.
What you doing back here?
She's come for a visit.
You're lying through your teeth.
She had to come back. You had to come back.
Shelby, let's go. Right now.
No. Not until I talked to my sister.
Let her go home.
Let her go back to wherever the hell that is.
Oh, come on.
The hell are you so defensive of her for?
I want you to go in the house.
No.
Now, Shelby!
This bitch. You walk out of here, now you get caught...the president.
Screw you.
Oh you always thought you were more than you was.
I can't handle this.
Oh, no.
You just handle the president.
All right, that's it.
We're going right now, Shelby.
I see what this is about.
You still mad about J.B.?
You still mad about that?
He's looking for you.
I don't know why.
Look, me and J.B it was nothing.
I don't want to talk about that, Shelby.
You really are mad.
Why the hell do I put up with you?
Why the hell do any of us?
Did you tell Annie here how you started screwing Brody after she left?
Shut the hell up, Shelby.
Oh, yes, she did.
She slipped right on in there after you was gone.
They couldn't wait for you to leave.
She went in there and got that man, you little cougar.
Oh, yeah?
Want to talk to me about J.B.?
Huh? Yeah.
What goes around comes around.
Do you see her face?
Look at her face.
You see?
Do you see what you did?
You didn't know?
You really didn't know?
Secrets in this family.
All I ever do is try to help you, Shelby.
I don't know why.
Don't bother Bonnie. Just let her go.
Oh, you know about letting go, don't you, bitch?
Shut your damn mouth.
Make me.
Make me!
Don't ask me.
Come on Annie.
Shelby.
Stop it.
I'm so sick of this sh1t.
I'm sick of these damn lies.
I can't handle this.
(SOBBING) I can't do this Bonnie.
It's all right.
I can't.
Come on, Bonnie.
She isn't going to change.
Maybe I could change.
Oh.
Maybe I could change.
I'm sorry I can't be more like you.
Huh? I can't be the miss perfect Annie and the miss perfect Bonnie.
I can't let go of what he did to me.
Bonnie, I can't do this.
He did it. And you let him.
Both of you let him do it.
You think you were the only one, Shelby.
Huh?
You should have stopped him.
You should have stopped Daddy.
You both should have stopped him.
I did stop him, Shelby.
I told Dr. Allen.
And I told the Sheriff.
That's why mom is going to hate me for the rest of my life.
Stop it, this is a rested, honey.
She is.
Yes, she is.
She hates me.
She obviously hates me, my own daughter hates me.
You didn't have to have a baby from him.
Oh my god Shelby, grow up.
Yes, I did. We all did.
I can't look at my daughter any more than you can look at your own son.
And Bonnie?
She had it the worst.
Those babies she buried, at least she's not making any damn excuses for throwing her life away like you.
(BONNIE CRYING)
It's not your fault. It is not your fault.
Get out of here, Shelby.
Get!
I'm sorry I'm like this.
I don't know what to do.
I tried.
I've tried so hard.
I tried to be better. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Okay.
Sorry, I'm so sorry.
:  It's hurt so much.
No, no, no!
Get your hands of her, J.B.
Get off me!
Stop here, now!
Get off of me. Where is it, huh?
Hey, you tell me where it is.
I don't know what are you're talking about.
You're gonna get me killed.
Now you tell me.
I don't know!
Stop it!
Where is it, Shelby?
I don't know what he's talking about.
That's it. You better tell me.
Move now.
J.B., stop!
Shelby, what did you do with it?
I don't know.
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
I'm going to kill you.
All right, all right.
J.B, look at me.
Take a walk. I'll talk to her.
Where is it?
I don't know what he's talking about.
You stole my...
Shut up J.B!
It was just a TV.
No it wasn't just TV.
The load on his truck.
What did you do with it?
I sold it. All right?
To who?
Hell if I know.
Damn it, Shelby.
Stop lying. Tell me right now.
Who did you sell it to?
Tell me now.
The Kilmer boys.
I sold it to them.
The Kilmer boys?
You got your answer.
Now get out of here now.
Go.
You're coming with me.
She's not coming.
Bonnie.
No.
Why? Why are you protecting this trash?
She's my sister.
Well, she's coming with me.
She's not coming with you.
What are you going to do, huh?
You gonna hit me now?
You don't think I will?
Go for it.
You move!
No.
J.B, no!
: No!
(SCREAMING)
What's going on out there?
No!
Stop!
J.B.!
(SCREAMING)
J.B.!
No!
