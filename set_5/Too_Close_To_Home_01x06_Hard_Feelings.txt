I want you to stop it, you hear me?
No, no, why do you...
Why do you idolize her so much?
Idolize her?
She's my sister, Mama.
No, she's a bitch.
Mama!
She left us.
You want me to leave?
No.
I was just asking you a question.
You aren't asking me nothing.
No, I did. I asked you why she's here.
And I also want to know how many times you called her for help.
Well, you can't even answer, look at you.
[Scoffs]
[Grunts]
That don't matter.
Oh, how do you figure that that don't matter?
Because she came here.
She's in trouble, and I'm not gonna turn my back on her.
You want me to do that?
Oh, ho.
No, you're just gonna...
You're gonna let her run all over you.
You're gonna let her do everything that Shelby does to you.
Just take advantage of you and do whatever the hell she wants.
Is that right?
I saw her get in that truck with J.B.
Really?
Yeah.
How'd you see that, Mama?
'Cause I got mirrors.
And you know what they did in there.
[Chuckles] You know.
I'm done.
No, are... are you done?
I'm not doing this no more.
No, you didn't even powder me.
You haven't dressed my sores.
I'll be back later, Mama.
I'm sorry!
[Sighs]
Bitch!
[Panting]
It's okay.
[Sobbing]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
It's all right, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Look at me. Look at me.
Okay?
Okay.
[Sighs]
Okay.
Yeah.
There you go.
[Sighs]
There you go.
♪♪
Daddy, no!
What the hell?
What is he doing?
It's there. It's in there.
This is suicide!
What is going on?
You're what's wrong.
Her boyfriend drove her here, and we can't find him.
Ugh.
Yeah, she didn't come here with no man this time.
I don't want him hurting you or that guy upstairs.
Can you believe this?
Yes, I can.
Tony, have you see this guy?
Look here, you country ass bitch...
Valerie. Shut up!
So, if he has been here, you better tell us now.
Annie, you better get these people out of here.
What happened to him?
He's been beat up something pretty bad.
Brody.
Annie's here.
How is she?
Is Brody seeing anybody?
No.
