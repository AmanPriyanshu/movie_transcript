Empire XStream...
We are taking over the world!
I do the music, you handle the business, and we stay out of each other's way.
I know you're working on the Black & White album.
I'm shelving it.
African-American men, the primary victims in gun violence.
If anybody's a victim, it's Freda Gatz.
I'm Zeah, Mr. Lyon.
Cookie, you should come down to the center sometime.
I can't get onstage.
I can't do it no more.
You got one job in this house and that's a mother.
Tariq, he may be your half brother, but he is not your friend.
Step away from the car.
Sir, I live right there.
(grunting)
Hey, Lucious.
Can we talk?
: Door is open. Come on in.
Hey.
You still, uh, obsessing over these streaming numbers?
Well, the board has determined that if I don't get to ten million subscribers by Thursday, they want to pull the plug which means I lose $50 million.
What's on your mind?
I'm like a prisoner in this house.
Come on, with nothing to look forward to.
You call looking after my granddaughter nothing?
You ain't gonna get much sympathy from anybody about this shack you calling a prison.
No, that's not what I mean, Lucious.
Look, I know that we have had our differences, but, I know that Cookie's looking for a new head of A&R.
And you know that that is never going to happen, so you need to just...
Lucious?
Are you okay?
Oh, my God, do you need me to call a doctor?
(woman gasps)
Mm.
No, I looked everywhere and I couldn't find my earring under there.
Damn.
Maybe you can look for it later.
Oh, Pia, you remember your old boss, Anika.
I like your assistant.
Pia, will you be a doll and get Cho in here?
I need to see the new Empire XStream artwork.
Keep putting your back into that work of yours.
Ooh.
Look what I found. (laughing)
(chuckles)
: 
Our main asset is exclusive content and I don't have it.
I need five new songs by the end of this week.
Man, I cannot get you five new songs by the end of this...
What is that?
: Incentive.
You are gonna give a car to whoever can deliver a new song that's ready to drop by this Friday.
And while you're at it, tell your son that I'm releasing his Black & White album.
Jamal does not want that album released, Lucious.
He done told you that a million times.
Well, I don't care. He can tell me a million more.
Look, Cookie, if you with me with this business, 50/50, then you're gonna get me those songs.
Okay. Sure.
I'll get on it tomorrow, after my lunch with Angelo.
What are you seeing in that Oreo, anyway?
I'm being proactive in the community.
I'm going to meet some of the WOKE kids from his foundation.
So he can warm your heart with how good he is with these kids.
He might warm something else later. (chuckles)
Everything's under control, Mom.
: He's coming out!
Yeah, I-I got... I got Max with me.
(crowd clamoring)
Max Perkins.
: Andre!
: Can we get a comment, please?
: Over here, please!
Over here!
Andre Lyon!
Mr. Lyon, can you tell us what happened?
Okay, okay.
Do exactly what we discussed a few minutes ago.
Don't go all "Black Lives Matter" on me here, okay?
We're good. Let's go.
(reporters clamoring)
This was all a simple misunderstanding.
My client has fully cooperated with law enforcement, it will all be cleared up in a matter of days. Thank you.
Your mother and father have a checkered history with law enforcement.
Are you just following in their criminal footsteps?
That's all for now. My client won't be making any statements. Thank you.
So, are you a gangster now, too, Andre?
What happened to me is what's happening all across America, right now.
: And what's that?
Hey, babe.
Answer her. Come on, she's waiting.
We both know that none of this would have happened if I was still here.
: I went back to the bar where it went down, like you all told me to.
I took my new lady with me.
As soon as we hit the door, I start shaking.
But you did the breathing?
Yeah.
And?
I'm still here.
You all noticed, we have someone new in group today.
This is Jamal...
Jamal Lyon.
Jamal... we ask new people to tell the group what caused their PTSD.
: Everybody knows what happened to Jamal.
They played it over and over again on the news.
: That doesn't matter.
Your fame just creates another barrier for your recovery because you have to face your trauma in front of the world.
It's still PTSD.
Yeah, I'm good.
Um, it's my first time, so I'm probably just gonna, you know, lay low and listen.
But thank you.
Okay.
Hey, Jamal. Hey! Hey.
Look, what happened inside, that wasn't cool.
That's not how we do things.
(clears throat) They all know what happened, so it's no sense in frontin' like they don't.
Let me ask you something, man.
Are you still taking any pain meds?
Yeah.
I was hoping to be off of them by now, but, um, I'm not, so...
It's nothing to be ashamed about.
When a soldier gets shot...
I'm not a soldier.
You were in the military, right?
Um, Major Philip Barrett?
You got shot.
Your PTSD is no less significant than mine.
If you need treatment, man...
Um, I came here, you know, just to... kind of, test the waters.
And, uh, it actually worked.
A lot, you know? All right.
And at this point, I kind of feel like I know how to manage this. Which is, it's great.
And that's... that's 'cause of y'all, so thank you.
Andre!
Hey. Oh.
Let me guess: it was a white cop.
I should've been smarter about it, okay?
I know this whole thing could've turned out a whole lot differently.
I wouldn't be standing here with you today, I know.
Nothing you could have done different.
You were born black.
What happened, Andre?
I was clearing out me and Rhonda's apartment, a cop shows up and...
Mm-hmm.
Look, I gave him attitude.
No, I don't want to hear that!
That's some B.S.!
Look, I'm-a make Thirsty take care of these cops.
Yeah.
Thirsty?
Let him look into these charges!
Pop, I-I don't need Thirsty, okay?
I got my own lawyer.
With the FBI watching our every move, the last thing we need is Thirsty taking care of anything.
I-I just want to do this the right way.
(scoffs) Andre, the right...
You do realize you're a black man, right, Andre?
And that was a dirty cop that did that to your face.
And since this was not caught on video, it is your word against theirs, all right?
No, see, the police messed up this time.
They done messed with the wrong ones.
So, we gonna fight fire with fire!
Enough!
(sighs)
I'm a Wharton graduate, Mama.
I'm a CFO of a publically traded corporation.
I'm not gonna fight fire with fire.
Andre...
I'm not doing it!
That boy is headed for a world of trouble.
: 
: Can I get a selfie?
: 
 we might be able to use against the Lyons.
You want a selfie? No?
I have no idea who that one is.
Porsha Taylor, Cookie Lyon's assistant.
Don't waste your time.
So, don't nobody know who I am?
Nobody knows Porsha?
That's cool. That's cool.
I got a question, sir.
Lucious Lyon was cleared of all charges last year.
What's this really about?
Lyon beat the case because it was mishandled.
All I have to do now is build a new case based on new charges.
Knowing Lucious Lyon the way I do, I have plenty to choose from.

Boy, your father was right.
The number of performance requests I'm getting for you has dropped to half.
I ain't ready yet, all right?
I'm not.

Kitty even said we have the live rights to Empire XStream, okay?
And I thought that would keep your father off of releasing that Black & White album of yours.
All right. Kitty...
I have a proposition for you.
Okay.
Wait... you want me to record for Empire?
You didn't think I brought you here to have tea, did you?
Look, I caught your performance at the summit.
It's about the only thing that kept me awake during them boring-ass speeches.
So unless you think Angelo's gonna mind...
I don't think so.
Good, son.
Let's go make some music.
(door closes)
Dad... now, I specifically said that the Black & White album is not to be released.
Yeah, well, Empire spent a whole lot of money on that joint, and we need to recoup.
Besides that, Empire XStream needs it.
Oh, God, do you ever not mention Empire XStream?
It happens to be a ravenous beast that is the lifeblood of this company.
So if we don't feed it some content, it's gonna consume each and every one of us.
: Okay, we get it.
You are a vampire.
(chuckles)
So let me bring you a freshly slit vein for your liking... Kitty.
Delicious. Keep bleeding.
She agreed to record a duet with me, and live-stream the session as exclusive content to Empire XStream.
Wow, a collaboration like that would bring in a whole lot of subscriptions.
: Yes, it would.
So... the Black & White album.

No, I ain't sleeping with her.

Hmm? Where he at?

That's bitch tendencies.
Where he at?
He never left.
'Cause that's who I want to see raising Bella.
Your song don't work without a female voice for the hook.
So I don't know what the hell you're doing standing here.
You need to get me that song.
I just saw Juanita holding Bella.

The world doesn't need another rapper.
Lucious...
Lucious did that so that you could be pissed at me.
Are you for real?
Yeah. That's how he plays, dirty.
All right, well, I don't care about all that.
This kid's future is bright.
So whatever y'all did to tempt him, you need to undo it.
Oh, I do, do I?
Yeah.
Undo it.
Do you know how many kids would kill to have a recording contract with Empire?
Yes, I know, because I see it every day.
That's what I'm trying to change.

I'm not finished, Counselor.
The defendant is also charged with felony battery, aggravated assault, and assault against a police officer.
Your Honor, I...
Step back!
Your Honor, I didn't assault anybody.
That's what a trial is for, Mr. Lyon, to determine your guilt or innocence.
Yo, so what do all this mean, man?
It means we might just need to plead out and cut a deal.
I could probably swing probation if it's your first offense, Wait. Wait.

: Personally, I think we're good.
: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me a second because, just, can we turn the lights down or something?
That's good... let's get the mood right in the studio.
I got it.
I think we're about to be front row and center for another Jamal flameout.
Andre.
They got you doing everything around here.
Just, uh, trying to help out, Kitty.
: Very nice.
What a waste of time.
So, um, I was thinking at the bridge, we'd treat it like... kind of like a rap session.
: He might need it.
Throw Auto-Tunes on the bridge.
Y'all ready?
I'm ready.

(applause)
(chuckles)
Y'all are some bad, bad, bad people up in there.
I can't believe this is real.
: Oh, it's very real.
That and much more, anything you want.
Even the keys to a brand-new car.
All you got to do is sign on the dotted line.
(sighs) I'm a little nervous.
Yeah, I'd be nervous, too, if I was signing my life over to the devil.
(chuckles) Look, Zeah, baby, I know this is hard, so I'm gonna do this for you.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?
Sending him to college, where he belongs.
Such a shame.
You could have been huge.
Did Mr. Wonderful put you up to this?
I put me up to this.
Zeah, look, when I look at you, I see more than a future multi-platinum-selling artist.
What I see is a brilliant mind.
Yeah, the world has enough rappers.
We don't need another one... yet.
But I tell you what.
If you're serious about music, you come see us after you graduate in four years.
Empire ain't going nowhere.
You really think this business is gonna wait for your ass?
You have Cookie's word, baby.
And that means a lot out here on these streets.
Thank you for what you did for Zeah.
You're welcome.
Angelo... you're not better than me.
I'm not ashamed of who I am, I'm not ashamed of where I come from, or the fact that Lucious and I started from the bottom with nothing.
And now we're here.
I'm not ashamed of the music I make, so...
I understand that.
I respect you.
I respect your music, and I respect everything that you do.
Thank you.
I mean that for real, Cookie.
Empire is an American triumph.
That it is.
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles) Whoa...
Oh...
(laughs)
Let's get some lunch first.
Yes. I'll get at you.
Okay. Nice try, though.
I'll get it next time.
(Cookie laughs)
Well, your father should be happy.
We got over ten million subscribers, and we spiked another 150,000 just in the hour after streaming you and Kitty's duet.
Why are you standing here looking stupid?
Wait for it.
Uh, wait for what?
: The Black Album?
What is that?
Yeah.
Good thing I took a bullet for him.
Now I can kill him myself.
Wait, wait, wait, Jamal.
: It's beautiful, ain't it?
Uh... Jamal!
So what the hell is the damn Black Album?
The Black Album?
Just a little something that came up in a marketing brainstorm.
You see, half the songs on that album, which Jamal likes to call "the black side," is produced by me.
Yeah, I know, I know.
So all I had to do was get rid of the songs that you produced, and it became this whole new concept.
I mean, his fans are gonna love it, it'll probably... double subscription overnight.
This ain't got nothing to do with Empire XStream, does it?
Yeah, this is personal.
Yeah, it's personal.
But it's also business.
'Cause, see that's what we do, right?
No, that's what you do, Lucious.
I like how y'all are judging me, like y'all are walking around with these haloes.
I'm a human being, Cook.
Good, you should try acting like one.
I did, until you hurt my feelings.
Oh, I kept hurting your feelings, Lucious?
Like you're the only one walking around here with feelings, really?
Well, you're walking around here demonizing me for how I run my company.
But I haven't seen ne'er one of y'all quit.
Yeah, because half of this company belongs to me.
And that's the piece you like to forget, Lucious.
Half of this company?
Half, that's right.
This whole separation of responsibility that you keep talking about, that's never gonna happen.
I'm retaking control of Empire Music because, at the end of the day, it's all business.
Oh, you are, are you?
Well, don't forget I have the board on my side.
So if you try to kick me out, that means war.
Is that what you want, Lucious?
Oh... (chuckles)
Well, all right... baby.
You wanna play?
Let's play.
Let the games begin, Cook.
Let's play.
Out walking while black.
Isn't that what got you in trouble in the first place?
(sighs)
What do you want?
Just seeing how you're doing under the weight of some nasty charges.
Assaulting a police officer?
Mm, mm, mm!
I read Officer Horowitz's amended report.
He makes you sound positively unhinged.
You gonna see some time after that... believe that.
You're behind this.
Some twisted way of getting back at my father.
You got that officer to lie and up my charges.
Oh, I just sat back and let the man talk.
By the time he finished, he remembered all kinds of mess about you.
That's how they do.
I just made sure I took advantage of the situation.
Mm.
You think I'm scared... of some trumped-up charges from a trumped-up Fed?
Is that what you think I am?
Maybe I'm just a black sheep just like you.
Hmm? Nah, hear me out, nephew.
We ain't so far apart.
Maybe you should do yourself a favor... before we get you, too. Hmm?
I get it. You think you can make me inform on my father in exchange for dropping some charges, right?
Let me help you out, Uncle.
That ain't gonna happen.
You are your father's son after all.
Well, we shall see.
It doesn't take much to put the screws on a black man, once he's part of the system.
And you ain't no ordinary black man.
You're a Lyon. Prize game.
Have a good night, nephew.
