And today we've got Jamal Lyon and City Councilman Angelo Dubois in the building and we're talking about violence in hip hop.
Now, there's a question that we've all been dancing around, so I gotta ask: Jamal, at the Empire XStream launch party, what happened?
It looked like you froze up onstage.
: No, I didn't freeze up.
That's not what happened.
Well, was it something to do with you getting shot? Because...
PTSD is nothing to be ashamed of, brother.
I'm sorry?
Posttraumatic stress disorder.
You see, these African-American men, uh, they're the primary victims in gun violence and they come from a culture...
I-I'm sorry, I'm just gonna jump in right there.
With all due respect, you're not a doctor, Councilman, so please do not diagnose me.
And-and furthermore, as far as "victim" goes, I'm not that.
If anybody's a victim, it's actually Freda Gatz.
: All right, well, then who put the gun in her hands?
: Well, Councilman Dubois has a point, now.
How is Freda Gatz the victim?
Well, then, why don't we all try to grow up where she grew up?
See, it's that line of thinking that does a tremendous disservice to black folk.
Wait, I'm sorry.
What-what country are we living in? "Disservice"?
It's actually not thinking, it's a fact, Councilman.
Urban, young, black children deal with poverty and racism, oppression from police brutality itself, mass incarceration, so how...
Understandable.
How are we supposed to deal with these circumstances if we marginalize ourselves?
Hmm.
I'll tell you how.
Education.
Opportunity.
See, this is what we promote in our program WOKE, all right?
We Organize for Knowledge and Empowerment.
Well, Councilman, why don't you tell Jamal Lyon how WOKE is taking on racism and oppression?
I have a better idea.
Why doesn't Jamal come and visit one of our anti-violence summits this week?
(mouthing)
Come through, we'd love to have you, sir.
I'd love to. I'm there.
All right, yeah.
Hmm.
Jamal, what the hell is wrong with you?
Agreeing to do some stupid summit with that bougie bitch.
He wouldn't know the streets if it shot him in the ass.
Lord, I know, Ma.
But you know what? He was making sense and you know it.
You know, what you need to be doing is making new music.
See, doing that radio station was just damage control.
You need to get your ass back onstage and prove to your fans that that brain fart was a one-time thing.
Ma... Ma, Ma...
Excuse me, Mrs. Lyon...
Ms. Lyon.
Ms. Lyon.
Are you joining us at the summit?
No, I'm busy, and so is Jamal.
I guess he forgot to tell you he's in the studio all week.
That's too bad. The kids are huge fans of yours.
As a matter of fact, they started Snapchatting already.
There we go.
Wow.
: That one's Isaiah.

That would be great. I appreciate that, from both of you.
Yeah, yeah.
Mm-hmm. We gotta go.
I look forward to seeing you both there.
Uh-huh, bye-bye.
Why you gotta be so rude?
'Cause we got a FBI agent up our ass.
We don't need a politician, too.
That man was being so polite.
I don't trust polite people, stupid.
: 
 might have had some difficulties had you not done what you did.
I mean, nobody's even talking about Jamal.
All anybody can talk about...
The press and me alike...
Is this rare talent that just blew everybody away.
: You shouldn't have cut me off.
We could've been making millions with Nessa a long time ago.
What I want to know is, what do you want to do next?
What's your next move?
: I tell you what.
Me and Shine already working on something.
You know, I was thinking about coming out with a living album, something like Yeezy with his Life of Pablo situation.
But bigger.
And my homie Nessa, she gonna help me do it, some of the tracks.
Is that what you really want?
With all the heat you got going on from being a part of my Empire XStream launch, when the world is your oyster and you can put any name in your bucket list, and these are the only two you want to work with?
As far as you and Hakeem working together, that's a whole nother conversation.
He's got an entirely new set of familial responsibilities he's gotta handle.
What's that got to do with it?
: Bella's at home right now with her mother, where you should be, but you've got a convenient case of amnesia.
But we're gonna talk about that in private, 'cause me and Shine... we got business to take care of.

That was good, though, wasn't it?
Look, you look full, don't you?
(laughs)
Hey, man, here you go.
Thank you, thank you, man!
Uh-uh, I'm keeping mine.
Candace would kill me if I didn't save her some crab legs.
Most of 'em are crackheads anyway.
Well, maybe they wouldn't be if someone had shared their crab legs a little sooner.
What are you, Mr. Save-the-World now?
With you by my side.
By the time you finish up at Howard, I'll be getting out of med school and I can set up a practice in King of Prussia.
All right, forget King of Prussia...
Look, Barry, stop.
I'm-a be honest, a'ight?
At some point, I want the house and the kids and all that stuff that you say, but right now?
I don't know what I want except I know it's got something to do with music.
And I don't want to feel locked down before I even give it a shot.
Ya'mean?
I understand, Loretha.
It's your life.
You won't get a second chance to live it the way you want.
: 
I got chin-checked by a remarkable woman who taught me the difference between being a victim of circumstance and a survivor of immeasurable pain.
I have a feeling I'll be thanking her over and over and over for that insight.
Now I'd like to bring up here onstage a man who is a new friend of WOKE.
The incredible Lucious Lyon.
(cheering and applause)
Thank you, Angelo.
I'm very proud of these young men and women here.
You guys represent our future.
And we are looking to you to be great leaders.
I have my son here.
And as you all know, he almost lost his life trying to save my own.
(applause)
Now I know we all want to get to the talking part of this summit, but before we do that, why don't we take a moment and have Jamal Lyon come up here and do a song, 'cause he has not performed since that event at the ASAs.
And I think this would be a most fitting moment for him.
(cheering and applause)
Jamal. Jamal. Jamal. Jamal. Jamal. Jamal.
: Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal!

Jamal.
What are you doing?
Huh?

(gasping)
What the hell is wrong with you?
What he need to do is get his ass on that stage.
'Cause the only way to deal with a problem, boy, is to deal with a problem.
It keeps happening.
Shh, all right.
It keeps happening.
You really starting to bore me, boy.
I'm scared, all right?!
That's what you want, right?
(gasping)
Well, yeah, I got a, I got a pro... I got a problem and I... can't get onstage.
I can't... I can't do it no more.
Yeah!
(indistinct chatter)
You were right.
Jamal has a problem.
So, what we gonna do to fix?
I don't think this is something you need to be smiling about.
Well, you said the magic word.
It's "we."

(both chuckle)
Ms. Lyon...

Well, Cookie... uh, you should come down to the center sometime and speak to the young women.
I think they'd, uh, they'd get a kick out of that.
Well, you should invite me over.
I will. I will, then, Cookie.
Yes.
Lucious...
Thanks again, man.
I think you had it right the first time.

Hell, Lucious just had him at the house.
He's a snake. What's the offer?
Yo, it's a hell of an offer, Beck.
And the best part about it...
I negotiated for you to come with me.
Who asked you to do that?
Lucious and Cookie make you head of A&R yet?
We are talking about it.
The word on the street... is that they're looking r somebody new.
It's time for you to bail, mama.
You need to be somewhere where you appreciated.
And we make a dope-ass team, Becky with the Good Hair.
That's real talk.
You know, Lucious gave me a job when no one else would even talk to me.
That's real talk. I'm not doing this thing.
Come on, this place is going down in flames, you know that.
What are you talking about?
We got hits across the board. You sound stupid right now.
I'm not talking about music!
The feds is gonna come and they're gonna start knocking the doors all down and around this place.

Ain't nobody as messed up as the Lyon brothers, I'm sorry.
