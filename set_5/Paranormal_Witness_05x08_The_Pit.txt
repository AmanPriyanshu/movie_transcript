I heard that the area had a sketchy history.
It was like the wild, wild west in that neighborhood.
(ENGINE REVVING)
I knew I wasn't alone.
Danielle?
(TREMENDOUS THUD)
 as a few small noises...
Had become a much bigger thing.
(TELEVISION STATIC)
 that didn't have good intentions.
My heart stopped.
(FAINT WHISPERS)
(MOTORCYCLE ENGINES REVVING)
(ENGINE REVVING)
(HAMMERING)
Obviously not tended to by the previous owner.
And nobody knew it was on the market.
It was very close to my tattoo shop.
(OMINOUS MUSIC)
(ENGINES REVVING)
I knew that in the '60s and '70s, the neighborhood had become inhabited by biker gangs 
The biker history did not put me off buying that property.
I got tattooed down the street at a Hells Angel-owned tattoo shop when I was 20.
I love that history.
One of the best things about the property was that it had a guesthouse.
It would be perfect as possible income rental or maybe a guest room and an art studio for myself.
(MELLOW GUITAR NOTES)
There were a few personal items in there, so I thought maybe somebody homeless was squatting in it when I bought it.
 and it was crunchy and stinky.
 that there was really nice hardwood floors underneath.
 gigantic hole in the floor.
 ripped out of the house.
I can't imagine a reason that you would need to do that.
 had a crack in it.
When I looked closer, 
I put tape on the cracks of the windows 
And it was just added on to my list of "to be done later."
The first month I bought the house, I did get a lot of the work done.
And it really started to feel like home.
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
Greg and I have known each other for 24 years.
We ran around in the same punk circle.
So we have a lot of common interests as far as bands we like to go see.
I mean, is it hot and beautiful here, or is that just you?
I was extremely happy when I was able to say I can pull up to this house on a daily basis and live here.
(WATER GURGLING)
Danielle, are you in there?
Being that the guesthouse was only feet away 
There was nobody in the guesthouse.
It was very, very quiet.
(URINATING)
(SOFT CLICKING)
I felt a stare that you know someone is watching you.
I got goose bumps.
The feeling was overwhelming.
There was no one there in the bathroom with me.
(FAINT SIGH)
It sounded like the sigh of a person.
I actually felt a breath on my neck.
I knew I wasn't alone.
Hey, babe.
Hey.
What's up?
I had never seen him that shaken up before.
Do you need a hug?
I felt, um, that there was something going on with the guesthouse.
Maybe he's just a little sensitive.
(WIND CHIMES TINKLING)
Oh, my God, you made it.
Yes.
(LAUGHING)
Oh, good to see you too.
My great friend Hana decides to move to California.
Danielle was so amazing.
She had a job waiting for me that I could walk into.
Hana was the perfect fit because then I can make some rental income, 
(EDGY MUSIC)
(DISTANT ENGINES REVVING)
Living room...
It's in this beautiful neighborhood.
It's close to work, and it's just the perfect size.
Oh, my gosh.
 and with Hana staying there, I was very excited.
(BOTH LAUGH)
Oh, yeah.
 because it became my storage room.
That's just boxes and stuff.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYS)
To feel like home and be somewhere where I'd feel creative and inspired.
Oh, wow.
It had an awesome picture on the label.
 in the bedroom sort of at eye level, just near the bed in the corner.
I like it.
Oh, thank you so much.
I'll see you later?
Bye.
Okay, bye.
I noticed that the record was twisted around the wrong way.
 and then went to bed.
(EXHALE SOUND)
(SCRATCHING, OBJECT PINGS)
(KNOCK)
 and I heard a loud knock.
(HEAVY KNOCK)
(LOUD THUMP)
It sounded like it was coming from under the floor.
(MUFFLED MALE VOICE)
(STATIC HISSING)
 make this static popping noise, and the screen flickered.
(PHONES BUZZING)
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
There was just this huge surge of sound.
(WHITE NOISE BUILDING)
How is this even possible?
(HAUNTING MUSIC)
(PHONES BUZZING)
(WHITE NOISE BUILDING)
(WHITE NOISE STOPS)
It just didn't make any sense.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
It was like someone had taken that vinyl and physically turned it all the way 
It just left me with a really uncomfortable feeling.
(WHOOSH)
I was immediately struck by how cold it was in the house.
I checked the air conditioner, 
So I went and I... I grabbed a jacket.
 which is just crazy for California, especially that time of year.
(WATER BUBBLING)
 a strange feeling.
As I looked up...
 as though somebody had just walked right past it and into the room.
 but there aren't any open windows 
(THUD!) (OBJECTS CLATTER)
(SINK RUNNING)
 and all of the doors were open.
(FAINT WHISPERS)
It sounded like a voice.
(WHISPERING) Help me. Help me. Help me...
It felt like it was coming closer and closer.
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
 somebody was whispering right next to my ear.
(CLATTERING)
Hey, Hana.
Hey, you want to go see a band tonight?
Hey.
Did you just whisper something?
No.
And being someone who's skeptical my... myself, I was hesitant at first to... to talk to other people about it, because I didn't want them to think I was crazy.
(BRUSHING SOUND)
I was rushing around, getting ready for work.
So I... I wiped the steam off of the frosted glass.
I saw something out of the corner of my eye.
Danielle?
I was pretty freaked out.
(FAUCET SPRAYS)
Ah!
Suddenly, I was hit with a jolt of icy cold water.
I had to physically turn the water back off.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I felt so creeped out in there.
Then something grabbed me and... and yanked me backwards.
It stopped me right in my tracks.
But there was nothing there.
I felt like I was going crazy.
I was at the point where I felt like it was more than
I wanted to handle and deal with on my own.
Look, there's something wrong with that guesthouse.
So I told Danielle everything.
Maybe you've just been working too much.
She'll do 12-hour days, and when she comes home, she's drawing for her next day.
Look, I'm gonna go stay with my mom for a few weeks.
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Take as much time as you need.
 and just clear my head and get out of the environment for a little bit.
Hey, do you mind if I have some friends stay in the guesthouse while you're away?
I invited Roy and his wife Cazzie to stay at my guesthouse for the weekend.
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Danielle's done a lot of my tattoos.
Actually, she's done this whole entire arm.
It took about, uh, five years, something like that, on and off.
She's amazing.
Holy cow. I love it.
Yeah.
Awesome. Dig it.
Here's to all of us.
Cloud nine. I stand up... stick's in the air... 
(HEAVY ROCK PLAYS DISTANTLY)
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
(CHIMES TINKLING)
It was pin-drop silent.
I mean, it was so quiet.
It was awesome. BEST SLEEP: yeah, out.
(WIND MOANING)
(CREAKING)
(TREMENDOUS THUD)
I woke up like,
"What the hell?"
When a bed shakes like that, I mean, I think that'd wake anybody up.
Though my wife, she slept through it.
(FOOTSTEPS)
 (THUD) tuh, tuh... (THUD, THUD) 
 (THUD, THUD, THUD)
(THUNDEROUS POUNDING)
 and just went... ehh!
For a second, I thought it was some...
Like... like, an earthquake tremor.
(BEADS CLACKING)
(THUD!)
(SLAPS) Another shove.
I knew this definitely was not an earthquake.
I was scared (BLEEP).
(TINKLING SOFTLY)
Just a little more paint, a little more polish.
Maybe a new roof.
Yeah.
It's coming together.
You sleep well?
Roy's face was kind of shocked.
Can I get some coffee?
Being on stage, you have that kind of confidence, you know.
And he looked like a man that had seen something or felt something.
What happened?
I knew it was definitely supernatural... experience.
I've never been so scared in my life.
Hana, Greg, and Roy now have all experienced things in the guesthouse.
Hey, uh...
Hey, Roy, Roy...
Can I talk to you before you go?
 have trouble sleeping or being scared in the night.
I noticed that the guesthouse door was open.
When I walked by the bathroom window, I noticed that there was finger marks across the window.
That's strange because... nobody's in there.
Greg?
 maybe somebody had strayed onto my property.
Greg?
(WATER RUNNING)
I was creeping around.
(WATER RUNNING)
But nobody was there.
All of a sudden, I felt... like a hand grabbed my hair.
(WHIMPERING, GASPING)
But there was nothing there.
And I started feeling very dizzy, nauseous.
As soon as I ran out of the guesthouse, I felt fine.
 and I was starting to believe that my house was haunted.
Hey.
Hey.
About what happened...
Look, it's... it's fine.
I just needed a break.
I can handle it.
I was just gonna put everything out of my mind and get on with stuff.
(CEILING FAN WHIRRING)
(THUDDING)
(THUD)
And it jolts me awake.
 that it wasn't anything to be afraid of.
(SLOW FOOTSTEPS)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)
 the sound of footsteps.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
(BEADS CLACKING)
(FOOTSTEPS LOUDER)
(THUD!)
(GASPS)
(SPOOKY MUSIC)
(BED CLANKING)
It became more intense.
(BED CLANKING)
(YELPS)
The figure had grabbed me.
(HAUNTING MUSIC)
(YELPS)
It was such a strong pull.
(CRIES)
What had started out as a few small noises had become a... a much bigger thing.
I knew that there was something there that didn't have good intentions towards me.
Hey.
Hey.
Why you sleeping in the car?
She didn't look like she felt well.
I can't stay in that house anymore.
I just... I felt like I was going crazy.
Something happened to me in there too.
I'm sorry.
Hana and I are like sisters, and I was really worried about her.
It's okay.
 experiencing anything negative, but it was nice to know it wasn't just me.
What's going on?
We need to get some answers.
I knew of a medium locally in the area.
We were put in touch with him through a friend of mine, and his name was Mark.
I've worked as a psychic medium for over 20 years.
And I do the work because I want to help people.
I want to be someone who can provide evidence.
 because I don't know if psychics are real.
You want us to fill you in on what's been going on?
Actually, no, not at all.
I don't want anyone's opinions.
I want to go in without any preconceptions as to what I experience.
The first thing I do when I get there is I clear my head.
Sometimes there's something.
I realized that there were bikers, in spirit, watching me.
I was apprehensive.
I recognized that I was dealing with something really significant at Danielle's property.
Immediately, I was drawn to the guesthouse.
I felt the presence of a young woman.
She's so scared...
He was genuinely affected by something in the guesthouse.
(WOMAN'S CRIES ECHO)
This girl was trapped in the guesthouse.
 (WOMAN WHIMPERS)
 right in front of me.
(FOOTSTEPS)
No. No!
(CRIES)
(WOMAN WHIMPERS, CRIES)
No! No!
He was a stone-cold killer, and I could see that in him.
No... no!
No!
He drugged her.
It was very shocking.
No!
(MUMBLED CRIES)
(HANDCUFFS CLATTER)
(WOMAN'S CRIES ECHO) No!
 threatening presence that I felt 
(EERIE MUSIC)
Bam, bam, bam.
Gunfire going off in my ears.
And I had to just block it.
(HAUNTING MUSIC)
(WOMAN CRIES OUT)
(WOMAN CRYING, WHIMPERING)
(GUNSHOT ECHOES)
Maybe it had something to do with what Mark was saying.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
(FAINT SIGH)
I could hear her last breath.
Oh, my God. That's...
That's exactly what I heard that day.
(WATER DRIPPING)
(WHIMPERING)
(WATER RUNNING)
It was powerful. It was horrible.
When I shared about the young woman's murder, Hana seemed to take it really kind of hard.
Maybe these things that I had experienced in the house weren't... random.
Maybe they were echoes of a story 
And she's still living it.
And I had to go and see what was there.
As I got closer and closer to that area, it felt like that something really bad had happened there.
(HEART-POUNDING MUSIC)
The biker was literally in my face, almost nose to nose.
(CIGARETTE BURNS)
Ah...
And that's when I felt the burn of the cigarette on my arm.
I mean, I'm not used to having them reach out and do something to me, and that happened.
 and I wanted to know what it was.
(SHRIEK ECHOES)
The feeling of death just overwhelmed me.
That was where they put her away like trash.
It started to make a lot of things make more sense to me.
The way I had 
(BROODING MUSIC)
I knew that there was something under the floor.
I just didn't know that it had happened on my property.
 and not be feeling afraid in my... in my own home.
I was sad that Hana was leaving, and I really didn't want her to leave.
(ANIMAL CRIES)
(STATIC BUZZING)
(TENSE MUSIC)
A man was standing right by my bed.
(BREATHING HARD)
My heart stopped.
(HAUNTING MUSIC)
(TENSE MUSIC)
(WHIMPERS, GASPS)
(SHRIEKING)
Greg!
Gre...
What's wrong?
The person was gone.
Oh, baby.
And she was frightened that evening.
She saw something that scared the hell out of her.
Where are you now, huh?
You picking on a woman, huh? Are you a coward?
"Bring it on," you know what I mean?
And that... that didn't sit well with Danielle.
Stop it.
(SCOFFS) Why?
Nothing's gonna...
A hand just grabbed my face.
(STRAINING)
(PANTING)
Greg was white as a ghost.
 from something that I can't see or something I can't control?
I had to get to the bottom of this.
Honey, what are you doing?
(WOOD CREAKS)
Babe, go back to bed.
I have to find her.
 does she want me to find her body so that the truth can be told?
As I sit here today, there's still a hole in my guesthouse floor.
I love my house, and I'm not planning to go anywhere.
I just haven't found it yet.
I am not gonna give up.
