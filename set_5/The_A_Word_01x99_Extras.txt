: 
You know, if you haven't got the lakes itself, 
 of the character of the piece as well.
: 
 for the Lake District, so it's been kind of great cos we get to see...
: 
 slightly more difficult when you're in the Lake District, 
 a bonding experience for the cast and crew, the Lakes.
: 
 some wind and some rain and some mud, but that's glorious England for you.
 of the story and how all the stories connect and intertwine.
: 
 so I think it's great and the little boy who plays... Max in it is absolutely fantastic.
 around a man like that is just like... you're in awe, you know what I mean?
I mean, I really like the Lakes.
Although it's...
Yeah, no, it is, it's... Although it is quite cold.
Yeah, it's a bit cold in here, but it's nice to be a tad warmer.
It was cold but the people in Broughton were amazing, weren't they?
Yeah, really nice.
: 
: 
Because we need to get...
Because we need to use them.
Yes.
We've got that amazing bus shelter as well.
We hope that's intact, although I think...
We need to take over your town again, so let's hope it's in one piece.
: 
 and everybody's just on board, cos it's an amazing piece 
 like a wider family within the crew and everybody, but, yeah, brilliant, I'm loving it.
: 
 The A Word 
 and jumped at the chance to work with him.
: 
 it was just so beautifully written and beautifully paced.
It was funny, it was sad, it was heartbreaking and warm.
: 
 really great at writing that kind of multi-generational, just the truth of being in a relationship.
: 
 but not overly melodramatic.
He's just got a really nice balance in his writing which I really admire.
: 
 but it expands that to how all of us have difficulty communicating and the gap between what we want to say 
: 
 our family and we started a long, long way out from shooting, looking for the right actor.
: 
 schools, drama groups, agents, anything, you know, put it on the radio, go online.
 Mardy Bum 
: 
 and then we looked at them on tape and, frankly, Max Vento, 
He has an energy that's right.
He's been remarkable.
: 
I can't imagine them having found anyone other than Max.
But he does it with brilliant humour 
: 
 a child with autism.
I mean, I don't really think it gets more difficult than that.
: 
 but he's amazing. He's so... He's brilliant. He's a little pro.
: 
 he's done a fantastic job.
I don't know... Yeah, I don't know how he does it.
Maybe he could tell me and give me some tips!
: 
 we wondered if we would find him and every day through shooting we wondered how we'd been this lucky.
He's been brilliant, he's been amazing.
It is the canvas upon which our story plays out.
: 
 and the landscape plays a role in the storytelling then.
: 
 for the character of Joe, that wilderness, that space.
: 
 he, dealing with his condition and his autism...
: 
 so having a very vast setting, that's very changeable, I think, is absolutely perfect.
The A Word 
 and any audience can look at 
 and hopefully see themselves, or people they know, reflected.
I think they'll really connect to it because they'll connect to this family 
 that everyone has within their family.
: 
 how we all get through life.
: 
 amazing, for something so simple as well. I mean, it's just a normal family.
: 
It's got strong characters and a complex family dynamic and it also doesn't shy away from the issue.
You know, there's no bells and whistles and by that I mean, you know, there's no car chases, there's no special effects, there's no, er, 
 and it's almost a simple story but... beautifully complex and beautifully told... I hope.
: 
It is the canvas upon which our story plays out.
 to a family drama.
I knew when I wanted to write this, that I wanted it to be in a place that was both 
 problems to seek help, particularly for Joe, the central child.
: 
 so I basically went round, I spent three or four weeks going to every single village in the Lake District.
 we thought could be possibilities, narrowed it down to three or four.
Then went out again with more people, 
 what made our village life in our story from two or three separate ones.
From, just purely from an aesthetic point of view, it's both beautiful and it carries a threat.
But also, I think the Lakes, as beautiful and stunning as it is, 
 going about their business in a way that's not at all picture book, I guess.
So that was important, too.
: 
 and look at the locations that we had to find.
 the architecture was... It was a collection of small rooms, 
Let's take a look at the Hughes' house.
This is the dining room, the living room, and the study, opened up to make it easy to film.
This is the hallway, and this is the kitchen - the heart of the Hughes' house.
 so we tried to make it a reasonable size but not too big.
In reality, only this part of it is the main Hughes' house that we filmed in.
 to give the space some depth.
We made sure that we could see literally from one end of the set to the other.
: 
 all kind of quite sort of foreboding and, you know, big hills, 
 so we can see the jeopardy in what might happen there from the beginning.
So that's what we were looking for, really.
: 
 but also a real challenge to bring a sense of that into the studios.
 in a pretty challenging and muddy environment.
Even though it's been hard work, I think that makes people push a little bit harder, if you think that you're making something worthwhile and something good.
: 
The Lake District has been a great home for 
 and has given us a huge amount of production value and visual splendour.
: 
 Yellow Peppers.
 and not about autism, and what's a better set-up to check it if not with families?
Which is the craziest, funniest, weird thing.
: 
 Wouldn't it be wonderful, wouldn't it be a wonderful dream if we could find a way to bring this here and work out what we could do with it?"
: 
 The A Word 
 quite a long one. The show is based on an Israeli series called 
 written and directed by Keren Margalit.
One of the great challenges in doing this show in another culture, in another country, is to have a writer that will have that sensitivity, that will have that vision.
And we were so lucky to find a writer that took the Israeli show, made it a totally British show.
: 
 into a whole different country, into a whole different language, the first thing you have to find is the writer 
Pete Bowker developed it with Patrick Spence at Fifty Fathoms.
Pete was inspired, very inspired by 
 in the way that only Pete can.
I love the original Israeli series, it's a towering achievement, 
 different with it, and to do something that would become our own.
: 
And he does it with such empathy but also with huge amounts of wit and humour, so you really enjoy spending time with these people.
I suppose what I loved about the version that I have kept 
It's very easy to write a drama about 
So the big thing was the Israeli series gave me permission to do that.
I go where Pete goes, I just find his voice extraordinary.
So, we developed the scripts together, took them to the BBC, and they... they said yeah.
So we've spent 2014, '15, developing the storylines, prepping the show, and began filming in the summer of 2015. And hopefully soon it will be on people's screens in early 2016.
