: Every patient who gets bad news 
But surgeons don't believe in miracles.
We have to make them happen.
Are you okay?
He has all the power now.
It's wrong. I'm his boss.
But I asked him out, and his "No" is always going to be there like a bloated corpse.
I've ruined work.
I've ruined it.
No. No, I'm not okay.
I was asking Alex.
Alex? Alex is fine.
He's lucky he still has a job.
Well, this is not his job. He's a surgeon.
He's still a doctor... in the clinic, where he doesn't have to look all of his stupid mistakes in the face.
Maybe let him answer.
I'm fine.
See?
I'm mean, it sucks, but I'm fine.
If you get any cardio consults today...
I mean even the slightest palpitation... you page Riggs.
I'm his boss. I give you my blessing.
I'm not doing that.
Maggie, this isn't a real problem.
You're making it one.
♪ My mind's blown There she is.
Hey!
Hey, how was New York?
Oh, my gosh, it was amazing.
Callie's got this great place right near the park, and Sofia's got this huge room all to herself.
She loves her new school. It's good.
Very good.
[Chuckles]
Uh, h-hey, when did you get in?
This... morning.
Welcome back, Robbins.
Uh, cool.
Well, uh, the... the gas bill came while you were away, so I went ahead and paid that.
Thank you.
And, uh, the bathroom sink... it just needed a new washer, so don't call your guy.
It's better than it looks.
And at least my eyesight's all the way back.
Good. That's good.
I'm glad.
I got to go.
Yeah.
Marriage is like a bed and breakfast in Vermont, with s*x.
Until you have kids.
And when I want the s*x, I don't have to get out of bed and drive to the s*x.
I just roll right over.
Can you stop it?
Why would I want to stop it?
Married s*x is dirtier than I expected.
Not the s*x, the bragging.
You're flashing your money after going to the ATM.
We get it. You're sex-rich.
It is not polite to brag in front of people who are sex-poor.
Some of us are barely making ends meet.
[Cellphones beeping]
Multiple MVCs coming into the E.R.
Hey, Pierce, I got a valve replacement.
You good in the E.R.?
Yep, I can cover the pit.
Got it. Shepherd.
Grey.
[Door closes]
Was that normal?
Why wouldn't it be normal?
No reason.
I mean, you were a tad deferential.
Amelia, don't.
Damn it.
Come on, I move out, and I'm dead to you now?
You just cut me off?
I asked Riggs out. He said no.
Wait, Riggs?
Yeah. I'm trying not to be weird about it at work, and you just said I wasn't weird, so there.
Not weird.
Except for the part where you keep talking about it.
[Door closes]
Nathan Riggs?
Uh, you're not busy, right?
[Chuckles] Nah.
I'm just carrying 19 pounds of lac trays so I have something to do with my hands.
Uh, can you get Tuck from school?
What, is he sick?
No, he's not sick.
Well, then, why am I picking him up?
Uh, there was an... incident.
What? Is he okay?
No, he's fine. Are you busy?
Yes, there's a seven-car pile-up in the pit.
I know! That's why I need you to pick him up.
Coming through!
[Indistinct conversations]
[Chuckling] Oh, come on. This is too good to miss.
Look, someone ran into a funeral procession just before it reached the cemetery.
[Sighs]
A funeral procession!
Limos hitting limos hitting limos.
And then all the limos smashed into the hearse.
Doors cracked open, casket went airborne.
A flying corpse.
All right, this... this is all one family.
All right, it's... it's... it's art, Miranda.
It's a hot mess of art.
And if you need me... if you really need me, I will go pick up Tuck.
But if you don't, come on, 'cause this is...
This is too good to miss. This is...
Someone hit a funeral, and you want popcorn and a front-row seat.
Shame on you.
Just for that, now you really have to go pick up Tuck.
Oh, I had to pick up Tuck anyway.
Just go.
[Gasping] I can't... I can't get air.
[Breathes heavily]
I know, but you have to put the oxygen mask on so it will actually help.
Where's my... Where's my brother?
Where's Julian?
Um, I don't know, but I can find out for you.
I'm right here, Morgan, just like I was two minutes ago.
Follow the light.
Again.
Can you give her something that'll calm her down?
Sir, I really need you to look this way.
My sister gets panic attacks.
It's not even her first one today.
Well, I'd like to rule out any injury to her heart and lungs, but thank you for the heads-up.
It was just out of nowhere.
We were almost to the cemetery when this jerk just came speeding out of nowhere.
The car just plowed into us!
And there was like a chain reaction like dominos.
Was it a drunk driver, or...?
I don't know.
When I figure it out, I will sue his ass.
It's what Dad would want.
Julian, that's the last thing Dad would want!
This funeral wasn't cheap.
I ordered orchids for the grave site.
Okay, tell me  if this feels dull or sharp.
Films are back, Dr. Shepherd.
And your scans are up.
Thanks.
Is my arm broken? It's broken, isn't it?
In two places.
Ohh!
I'm making a list of everyone in the family's injuries.
We're not paying for any of this!
Excuse me.
I need to find out where Barb is.
Do you know if she's okay?
Well, actually...
Barb is my sister.
She's dressed in black. Oh, that's no help.
She's a little shorter than I am.
Blond hair. Barbara Davis.
Okay, um...
She is in a procedure room.
She is getting a few stitches on her forearm.
Looks fine otherwise.
Oh, thank goodness. Thank you.
And those two over there, they're my children.
Are they okay? Morgan and Julian Fisher.
Morgan... they are making sure that her heart and lungs are okay.
Julian has a broken arm and a cut on his forehead, but I made sure he's okay, so...
And Carl ruptured his spleen. Gene broke some ribs.
Michelle mostly has broken glass in her hair.
Lynne has whiplash.
Only Pete came through unscathed.
Pete is...
Pete is my husband. He's dead.
This was Pete's funeral.
Oh, God, ma'am.
Georgia.
Georgia, I'm so sorry.
You shouldn't... Someone should be taking care of you.
We have a waiting area...
You know, right now, I really feel like I need to be doing something.
But if you could find out where they took him...
You got it, yeah.
Edwards!
Sir, I know...
The patient in this bed is deceased.
I know.
Not just deceased, embalmed.
The deceased, Peter... it was his funeral.
The hearse and the coffin got totaled, and the EMTs couldn't just leave him in the street.
Call the morgue.
I did, but they're taking their sweet time.
There's not a lot of urgency in that job, I think.
Then call them again.
And find some place else for Mr., um...
Peter.
This is a room for healing the sick.
Yes, sir.
Corpse in the emergency department.
It's just creepy is what it is.
[Screams]
Kara, I need you to try and slow your breathing, okay?
Oh, God, is he alive?
I can't even feel his little kicks.
He may be less active from the pain meds we gave you, okay?
Please, just tell me... Is he...
[Heartbeat]
Okay, you hear that?
Mm.
That's a strong, stable heartbeat.
He's okay.
Films are back.
Yeah. good.
Hey, uh, do we know where the deceased guy was put?
Um...
What? Who else is hurt?
Is everyone hurt? Did I kill anyone?
Oh, you were the driver?
[Sobs]
I was late for the funeral.
I came around the corner, and there they were, the whole procession.
I ran right into them.
It was me.
: Kara, it was an accident. I'm sure they'll understand.
Not my family. [Sniffles]
They've never understood me.
I haven't even seen any of them for almost 10 years.
Dad maybe, but Mom, Julian, and Morgan.
[Sniffles]
[Sobs]
God, I never should have come back.
I just wanted to tell my Dad that I love him.
It's okay, it's okay. It's all right.
Kara, your pelvis is fractured, and there may be some bleeding.
We need to do a C.T. scan to check for bleeding and other injures, all right?
C.T.? Is that safe for him?
It's a minimal risk for the baby, but we need to know how badly you're bleeding, okay?
[Groaning]
Yeah, um, just... just page me when she's in C.T.
[Sighs]
The clinic is supplied for crap.
You didn't pick up my calls or answer my texts.
Arizona...
I was worried about you.
No, you were mad at me.
Damn right I was mad. I'm still mad.
You beat up my roommate.
So, that's why you're mad?
Some guy you barely know who pays you rent got beat up?
[Sighs]
What the hell is wrong with you?
Look, let's not do this. I've had enough lectures.
I'm not in the mood for another one.
Your job is to take care of children.
Look, Arizona...
Your job is to take care of children.
You want to throw your life away? Or your career?
The career that I helped you build?
I trained you.
I had your back, and I always pushed for you, no matter what anybody said.
I know!
Alex!
I know all of this.
You can't tell me anything I haven't already heard from Bailey or Mer or Jo... or frankly, the State of Washington.
And hearing it one more time isn't gonna help anything or change anything or fix me or turn back time, so just shut up and back off, please.
Excuse me.
What do you got?
Possible mesenteric tear.
Hm. Hemothorax here.
Is Pierce okay?
She's in the pit, I think.
No, I mean with me.
Oh, don't flatter yourself. She'll live.
All right, all right.
You know, for what it's worth, I feel pretty bad about it.
She's my sister.
You think I like telling her she can't have the good thing?
Then let's just come clean, tell her why.
We'll feel better. It'll feel really good.
Why don't you just focus on your patient's hemothorax?
All right.
"The good thing."
Excuse me.
You called me a good thing.
Forget I said it.
You ain't the boss of me.
Actually, I own a big chunk of this hospital, so technically, I am.
[Elevator bell dings]
Well, then, after you.
Damn right.
Hey, what are you doing here?
So, I've been prescribed movement, since my incision's healed.
I'm supposed to get up, get out.
I can walk now.
I should walk, actually, you know, to get better.
So, walking.
You can walk around the block, you know?
In the neighborhood. It's a really nice neighborhood. You should check it out.
Yeah, I know, it's totally...
It's s-super nice. So is the house.
Um, but I figured... I-I figured you'd want to see the baby.
You know what?
That's really sweet of you.
I-I did just see her like an hour ago.
I know, but look at this one.
You can't get enough of this little nugget.
No, I guess you can't.
Okay, so, we are just gonna go down to the E.R. for a minute, check out what's going on down there.
I hear there's a big MVC.
Really?
So...
What?
You're gonna take her down to the E.R.... a newborn with all the blood, germs, and dying people?
Right. Not a good idea.
No. I'll walk you out.
Who wants to see Daddy?
No, that... Hey, sweetheart.
Oh, there.
You excited to see Daddy? So good.
Okay. Bring her back when she's hungry.
Hey.
I picked up Tuck, and you know what?
Tuck's teacher said he got in a fight.
Oh?
They... They said that he pushed another child and that he started it.
They said that?
They also said they told you all of this already over the phone.
How's that, now?
Miranda.
I must have, uh, misheard.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [Chuckles]
Aren't you gonna go in there and bring down the hammer on him?
I'm gonna let him sweat it out.
But he knows what's coming.
The hammer will fall.
Your husband has been moved to a private room, and the funeral home has been notified.
Okay. Okay, thank you.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
What's wrong?
Your daughter was injured.
She is okay, and the baby is okay.
35 weeks, almost time.
What?
But I'm afraid, uh, your daughter was the one who caused the accident.
No, I think you're confused.
Morgan was in the car with me when we got hit.
I'm so sorry.
Uh, your other daughter, Kara.
Kara?
Like I said, she and the baby are both stable.
Kara's here?
Kara's having a baby?
Kara?
What?
She... is.
She... fractured her pelvis.
Kara's here?
Wait. Kara was driving the car?
: She's pregnant?
You have got to be kidding me!
She had the nerve to show up!
Kara did this to us?!
She said it was an accident.
Of course she did. Classic.
Julian.
Drugs again, right? Has to be.
I hope not.
They said she's knocked up.
Good Lord, what's next?
What Pete and Georgia did to be saddled with that mess!
You said my husband was here.
Can I see him, please?
I'm sorry.
This was the best place we could find for him.
The morgue guys were supposed to come and get him, but they said he was dead when he got here, so he's not their problem.
He's the funeral home's problem.
And it's just become this whole big thing...
Edwards.
Take all the time you need.
Always thought I'd go first.
[Chuckles]
Actually, no.
If I pictured it, I thought we'd go together... holding each other's hands.
Honey...
Kara's back.
It's a miracle.
Kara came home.
Our baby came home.
A felony?
I know.
I mean, he did beat him up really bad.
Yeah, he did.
Then again, you can punch a cardio surgeon in a hospital hallway, and nobody says a word.
Wait, wait... apples and oranges.
And yet Alex is charged with a felony assault.
Apples and oranges.
Riggs and I, it was personal.
No, just apples.
It was about Wilson. It's about a girl.
How is that not personal?
Shepherd just paged. The mom's okay.
Oh, good.
Kara, we just got word that your mom is fine.
She wasn't hurt.
Okay, thanks.
Does she know I'm here?
Yeah, I think that they told her.
Oh, God.
[Sobs]
Then she knows. She knows that it was me.
Maybe that wasn't a great idea.
But, I mean, I thought that she should know.
They haven't seen each other in like 10 years.
Oh. Um...
Kara, I'm... I'm so sorry, but the machine cannot get a clear read unless you're very, very still.
Okay. [Stifled sobbing]
Okay, sorry.
It's okay. It's okay. Take your time.
[Stifled sobbing]
: It's so sad.
I mean, can you imagine saying goodbye to somebody you've woken up next to every day for 40 years?
So, Riggs, huh?
It's nothing. I mean... it's nothing 
It's stilted conversations and avoiding eye contact.
And he said no?
Oh, yeah.
To 
Right? Thank you.
Yeah.
We don't have to talk about it.
I've been trying to talk about it, but Mer won't listen.
She thinks I should just forget the whole thing happened.
They're here for Mr. Fisher.
[Knock on door]
Mrs. Fisher?
Georgia, the men from the funeral home are here.
Oh.
Okay.
[Groaning]
Why is someone with him?
She has had a rough day.
Georgia, I'm sorry, but it... it really is time.
[Gasping]
No, no, no!
Dr. Pierce! Georgia!
Out of the way! Move!
[Monitors beeping rapidly]
She's in V-fib.
Continuing CPR.
Edwards, ready?
Yeah.
Charge to 120.

[Video game beeping]
Well, what... whatcha doin'?
Oh. [Chuckles]
I, uh... I asked you question.
Sorry. I'm leveling up.
Oh.
Well, um, what did your mom say?
About what?
What do you mean "About what"?
I haven't seen her.
What are we waiting for?
Sorry?
Tuck is just hanging in your office, playing on his phone.
No hammer has fallen.
What are we waiting for?
[Chuckles] "We."
[Sighs]
What?
We are not waiting for anything.
He is my child. I will handle it.
Well, right now, you're not doing anything.
You think I don't know that?
Look, I have to bring down the hammer at work every day it seems like lately, so excuse me if I'm not jumping to do it at home, too.
Now I have to explain to my son why 
 to pick on other kids?
It's exhausting! I'm exhausted.
And right now, 
 exhausting.
[Monitors beeping rapidly]
Edwards, ready?
What's going on in there?
They're running a code.
[Paddles whine]
I just froze off a wart.
Continuing CPR.
I just wiped a butt.
[Sighs] I did that, too.
Well, my body is making food for another human.
That's something, I guess.
Charge to 270.
You got me beat there.
Clear.

Charge again.

The force of your fracture tore some vessels in your pelvis, but your scan showed that there's no active bleeding.

What does Mer say exactly when you talk about Riggs?
She just...
So, the morgue is on its way.
Uh, they said since she died in the hospital, they are more than happy to come.
Tell them to wait, and keep your voice down.
Show some respect.
Respect?
Uh... we're having a funeral?
That's allowed?
It's fine.
Okay. I'll let the morgue know.
You were saying.
What?
It's like she doesn't want to hear it.
At all.
Like I'm annoying her.
Which, maybe I am, but be a sister, sister.
I mean, if it was her and she was... craving something that she couldn't have, I would commiserate.
I would at least listen.
I'll listen to you. Anytime.
Mm, I don't think that now is the best time.
I'm not listening.
Then how'd you know to say that if you weren't listening?
[Door opens]
If Dr. Webber finds out about this, I'm gonna be in trouble.
I told you it's fine. Nobody needs the room.
This family was primed for a funeral.
Not hers.
I wish I was as good as Mer at forgetting things.
My life would be a lot easier if I was.
Okay, she does not 
 things.
She 
 them.
She thinks they're gone, but trust me... they are not gone.

What?
No, she squeezed it.
I was holding her hand, and she squeezed it.
I'm telling you.
Morgan, I am sure that you did feel something.
No, no, no, I-I don't think she's dead.
The body can experience residual reflexes.
Yes, muscles can spasm, and then they stiffen.
There are a lot of reasons for slight movements.
This wasn't slight.
Okay, I promise you it does not mean that she is actually...
[Gasps]
[Screams]
No, that woman is alive.
I love my job.
She 
 dead?
Yes.
And now she's no longer dead.
Also yes.
We saw her flatline, and she's not dead.
: Lazarus syndrome... spontaneous return of circulation after failed attempts at resuscitation.
: Or a miracle.
You can't rule it out.
Well, when we tell a family a patient is dead, I prefer we be correct!
It's a low, low bar for a physician.
How is she, besides undead?
We won't know about neuro deficits until after the cardiac workup.
I did detect a slight murmur.
I'm going to run a T.E.E. to make sure there aren't any abnormalities.
Edwards, will you check on that?
Hell yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yes.
Yes, Dr. Pierce.
We got her back. Don't blow it.
Do not lose this woman a second time.
Understood.
Got it.

: Let's continue with chest compressions.
What's going on in there?
A guy came in... fell three stories off his building into the alley.
Ooh, Dumpster dive.
Guys, don't mess around with intubation.

What are you waiting for? There's too much swelling.
Just cut him already.
Come on, you guys!
There it is.
Okay, they got it.
God, I miss this. I miss the pace of it.
Yeah.
I can't wait to get back here.
I cannot wait. Can't you?
Well, you know 
 coming back.
I'm sorry.
I should get going.
Guys, just push more epi.
Sorry.
You're doing great. Good... Good work, everyone.
See, now, this is where his eye 
 be, but instead it's trapped in the broken bone.
Geez.
Yeah, that's what can happen when you punch people, Tuck.
Mm-hmm.
Who is that?
Doesn't matter. I'll tell you who it used to be.
He 
 a surgeon.
That's right.
But now he may never be one 'cause he's blind in one eye.
What?
Oh, oh, and the guy who hit him? He's in jail.
Probably for a long time.
Want to go to jail, young man?
No, sir.
Well, that's where fighting gets you.

Uh, yeah, and that's his collarbone.
[Loud snap]
Lazarus syndrome has only been reported 38 times since 1982.
Advance the probe, please.
She could have had impaired venous return due to dynamic hyperinflation of the lungs, which caused delayed action of the drugs we gave her during CPR.
Or a transient myocardial stunning or electrolyte imbalance.
No one knows for sure why this happens.
Or she missed her daughter, wasn't ready.
I'm just glad we were there.
Oh, God, because what if she'd woken up in the morgue?
She could still be there for all we know, just crying out for somebody, no one's there.
Banging on the wall of her metal drawer.
Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk.
I really have to concentrate on this.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
'Cause if we lost her a second time, ohh, that poor family.
Could you ever count on anything again?
I mean, it'd be like we were throwing away a second chance.
And not just Georgia's, but ours, 'cause we're never gonna see this again.
Statistically speaking...
Edwards.
All this woman wanted to do was die holding her husband's hand, and she did that.
She got to die holding his hand.
And then she came back to life.
[Chuckles] Sorry if I'm too amazed.
[Baby crying]
Wait. Georgia's 
 dead?
Curved mayos.
Not according to Shepherd.
Incredible.
So this little guy is gonna get to meet his grandma after all.
Take him to the NICU and page Karev.
Um, Karev's in the clinic.
Oh, right. Uh, just take him to the NICU.
You don't know that.
Know what?
If Kara's mom would ever forgive her. You have no idea.
Of course she will. It's her mom.
Well, not every family is like that.
It's just really dangerous to get someone's hopes up.
That's not the kind of thing that you promise.
Geez, Wilson, have a little faith.
[Monitors beeping rapidly]
B.P.'s dropping. We're losing her.
There's some major hemorrhaging. Let's get some laps.

You hear about the miracle lady in the E.R.?
M.I.... coded her for 40 minutes, dead for 20 more, then she sat up.
[Gasps]
Shut up.
Yeah. Awake and alive.
She's got to be gorked.
You can't be down for that long without deficits.
We'll see.
Pierce is doing a cardiac assessment now.
Could be a miracle.
She's gorked.
You ever have that dream?
What dream?
The miracle dream.

I'd roll over in bed, and there she was, asking me to go make coffee.

♪ Oooh, ooh ♪
A knock at the door.
Sorry?
He knocks at the door, says he forgot his keys, and he's sorry for being gone so long.
She's gorked.
Pupils reactive, reflexes intact.
I'm seeing no neurological deficits.
: We're gonna keep an eye on her heart, but for now, she looks good.
Do you hear that, Mom? You're okay.
How are you feeling?
Tired.
How about Kara? Is she okay?
I'm sure she's fine.
Yeah, she always walks away from the wreck.
Oh, please.
She is your sister.
And maybe you have had your problems in the past, maybe she is a train wreck.
Maybe she is a walking demolition crew, but she came back to you.
She came back to her family.
Yeah, and she killed our mother!
And your mother came back, too.
Do you know how rare that is?
Since 1982, that has been recorded...
Edwards?
38 times.
Which might as well be never.
And now Mom is fine, and you're both fine, and you should all be celebrating.
And instead, you're just whining and fighting when your sister came back.
And your mom came back.
Do you really want to throw that away?
Is that what your father would have wanted?
[Sighs]
You two deserved that.
[Cooing]
Aww.
I would have thought you would have both been gone by now.
Oh, yeah, you know how it is with a baby.
Everybody wants a turn.
Uh, pretty bad Le Fort fracture in O.R. 3.
I saw that.
Should have seen the intake. It was gnarly.
How gnarly?
Uh, about 8, 9.
Nice.
You are bored out of your freaking mind.
Oh, my God, I'm so bored.
[Breathes deeply]
And I can't move as much as I want to, so we just sit and stare and stare and stare.
And I love Harriet. I do, obviously.
I mean, she's a miracle.
She'll make a little face or, like, a little sound at me, and I'm just like dumbstruck with gratitude and joy.
Just, like, delighted and amazed.
Yeah.
But th-then the delight and amazement fades a little when she goes back to sleep.
And I stare.
I did not know a miracle could be so boring.
Why don't you go check out the Le Fort for yourself?
Really?
Has everyone had their turn?
'Cause Daddy would like one.
Thank you.
So sweet.
[Cooing]
Hey, sweetheart.
[Sighs]
Kara, he's right here.
Hi. He's okay?
Yeah.
I didn't screw him up?
He's great.
[Sighs] You're here.
Hi, you.
You both did great.
: I hear we have a nephew.
Uh, they... they said it was okay if... if we're family.
We just wanted to see if you were all right.
If you needed anything or...
I'm so sorry.
Hey. Hey.
It was an accident. Everyone's okay.
It's okay.
No, not Mom. Mom's not okay.
Mom's fine.
What?
Yeah, Mom's good.
I mean, you killed her, but she's really good now.
See? They forgave her.
Yeah. You got really lucky.

You know, all I've been doing today is listening to siblings talk and complain and talk and complain, and all I really want to do is to get something to eat.
I'm good with that.
What about you? I can't be the only one talking.
Sisterhood is a two-way street.
Is there anything you want to get off your chest?
Any guy you're into?
No.
The fever breaks. The stitch holds.
The bone heals.
That's why they can be hard to spot and why they can be such a pain in the ass.
You're not supposed to be here.
[Sighs]
I heard you did an emergent C-section.
Yeah. I almost lost the mom 
 the baby.
You're pissed.
Yeah!
Yeah, I'm pissed.
That baby deserved the best peds surgeon we have, and we didn't have him because you screwed up.
Yeah.
Today, I froze a wart, diagnosed three sinus infections, gave someone a laxative and waited until they pooped.
I wanted to quit every five minutes today.
I wanted to walk out the damn door and never look back.
So now you're gonna complain?
That's the point. I'm not.
I'm gonna do my time, work in the clinic, and help people.
I want to come back, and I'm gonna do whatever it takes, and I'm not quitting.
And that's the guy you... trained and raised and whatever, so...
Okay?
I missed you today.
But I'm still really, really mad at you.
I know.
Me too.
