Previously on Z Nation.
Forget about humanity, Warren. It's over.
Join my mission.
And be your bitch blend? I don't think so.
Hi. I'm Simon. Who are you?
Kaya.
I also go by...
Citizen Z.
I'm a huge fan.
Enders.
They're humans, but their brains are fried.
We're gonna find Murphy.
And then you, Dr. Sun, will make a vaccine and save this sorry ass world.
What happened? Where is everybody?
We're going our own way now.
Where are you going?
To start a new world.
[horn honking]
Come on! Move it!
One other car in North America, and I'm stuck behind it.
Get out of the road, Apocabillies!
You're gonna attract Zs.
Relax, kid. You're with me.
Maybe we should help them.
I'll handle this.
Don't.
Don't. Don't!
She's dying.
[crying] Don't touch her! No!
We can't let her turn.
What is it gonna take to get you people out of the road?
Our daughter's dying.
Oh.
Maybe I can help.
(Warren) Sounds like we're getting close.
He can't be far.
The signal's too strong.
We don't find him soon, we better quit looking for Murphy and start looking for some gas.
Less than 500 meters. Straight ahead.
All right, people.
You know who we're dealing with. So let's be ready for anything.
Well I hope you plan to give Murphy a stern talking to.
I'm gonna hog-tie and shrink-wrap him if I have to.
Just say the word.
We must be right on top of him.
I don't see the Murphy Mobile.
Where is he?
[growling]
After you.
[electric zapping]
[electric zapping]
That's either some kinda zombie pacemaker or we just found your transponder.
Good thing we got all this high tech help.
Is it me or is Murphy getting smarter?
Now there's a scary thought.
What's next Jefe?
We're running on fumes.
We gotta keep moving until we can't.
Gotta be something we can find for fuel.
[gagging]
All right, everyone. You know the drill.
Not much here.
Yeah, the entire world's been picked over 100 times by now.
Maybe we'll get lucky.
Yeah, I dunno why I just said that.
Look alive, everyone. Puppies and kittens.
[snarling]
Wow. Somebody really wants their mail.
[snarling]
Anyone noticing anything unusual?
Yeah. They're not interested in us.
[snarling]
Looks like they're after something.
There's someone inside.
[snarling continues]
What are you thinking, boss? Piking party?
[snarling continues]
Why do you want to stir up the anthill?
[snarling continues]
Yeah, I suppose we can't just leave him in there.
[snarling continues]
No! Don't hurt them!
For God's sake don't hurt them!
Did he just say don't hurt the zombies?
Don't mercy them!
They're just a little riled up!
Hang on!
Oh oh oh, look.
I got a treat. Go, go. Go get it.
[snarling]
[snarling continues]
Wally Becker, USA Postal Service.
Follow me if you want to live.
Do what he said.
[snarling]
Neither rain nor sleet nor zombie hordes.
[snarling]
[electric guitar theme music plays]
You've only got a minute before they find you again.
Now, what do you want?
We're not bandits.
Just some weary travelers, man. Looking for fuel and water.
I might be able to help you. On one condition.
No zombie killing.
Seriously?
I have my reasons.
Besides, these walkers are too slow to be any real threat.
You'd have to be an idiot to get killed by them.
So no piking, no shooting, no mercy of any kind.
What are you, some kind of zombie hugger, bro?
You want my help or not?
Okay. We need your help. So no mercy it is.
But we will defend ourselves if we have to.
Just do what I say and you'll be fine.
This is the safest building in town. Follow me.
Lets go.
[snarling]
Six.
Eight.
Ten.
Eleven.
You skipped seven and nine.
They're unlucky.
Since when is seven unlucky?
I don't know. I hate exercise.
Come on.
One more time around the village.
You need your strength so we can get you back on the air.
You can do this.
Comin' at you on all frequencies known to man.
Short wave, long wave, dark wave, broadband, x-band, two cups and a string.
If you can hear the sound of my voice, I want you to get up off of your ass and get ready to fight back.
Kaya.
You can do this.
Kaya, stop.
Listen.
I'm super grateful for everything you've done for me.
But there's no more transmitter, so there's no more Citizen Z.
All right?
I'm just Simon now.
Even if I could get back on the air, I'm not even sure there's anybody left to listen.
I'd listen.
Nana would listen too.
Come on.
One more time around the village.
Why are we stopping here?
To take in the view.
There it is.
Home of the 1974 World's Fair.
You ever hear of the Lilac City, kid?
Course you haven't. You grew up in a cave.
Take it in.
You got nature right here.
It's perfect.
Our new home.
Spokane!
[growling]
[growling]
You sure they can't get in?
Positive.
The McCloud Branch of the USA Postal Service is the safest building in Siskiyou county.
And in disaster, this is a civil defense shelter.
Oh, well we'll keep that in mind in the unlikely event of a disaster.
You live here alone?
Oh, I'm never alone.
I'm always surrounded by my friends and neighbors.
You're aware that your friends and neighbors want to eat your brains, right?
Well they can't help it.
It's their nature.
I usually have no problem keeping ahead of them.
But my battery died.
Why haven't you given them mercy?
And be all alone?
I love these people.
I don't have the heart to mercy them.
We've all had people that we love turn.
Mercy is better.
That's why they call it mercy.
You knew them all?
It's a small town.
I was postmaster for seventeen years. Oh, yes. I knew them.
Birthdays. Wedding announcements.
What magazines they read.
Who got the plain wrapped packages.
I knew everything about them.
Maybe too much.
That's why I just can't bring myself to mercy them.
Little late for Christmas, bro.
My favorite time of year.
I try to open a few cards every month or so just to cheer myself up.
I've been living off all the Christmas packages.
Fruit cake?
Fresh as the day it was made.
That's what I'm afraid of.
No, I'm good.
You read their mail?
Nothing else to do.
Keeps me in touch with them.
I don't usually make contact with strangers, but it's been so long since I saw another living soul.
I thought I'd take a chance.
What is it you need?
Gas, food, and a little water, and we will be on our way.
Is there a two-way radio anywhere nearby?
Radio?
Well there used to be one over at the city motor pool.
Doubt it works though. No power.
If you could show us, please.
Yeah, sure.
There's something you folks could do for me too.
Help push start my mail truck.
Let's do it.
Magnificent.
Unapologetically powerful.
Just like I remember.
What are we doing here?
Oh ye of little imagination. This is where it all begins.
Where the new world order, my world order, stakes its claim.
You're insane.
The definition of insanity is doing the same exact thing over and over and expecting a different result.
Look at me.
We've been doing the same thing for two years. It ain't working.
Time for something completely different.
You will see the wisdom of my actions.
And thank me.
[snarling]
Relax. They won't hurt you.
You're with me now.
I'm not with you.
I'll never be with you.
And yet, here you are.
We need to start setting up a lab and working on the blend vaccine right away.
But first, we need a base of operations.
My castle.
My lair.
My fortress of solitude.
Come along.
We're wasting precious time.
[muffled sounds]
Hypnotic, isn't it?
Come on, kid.
It'll be okay.
[growling]
No offense but the good people of McCloud are starting to give me the willies.
They're actually good company once you get to know them.
Their behavior is just a parasitic reaction to stimuli.
That's where you're wrong.
Motor pool is just over there.
Radio's in the dispatcher's shack.
Mail truck is back is way.
We'll get the mail truck started, fill up these gas cans, swing by and pick you up in 20.
Copy.
And no piking!
You know those things are gonna eat your brains someday, right?
You want your gas?
[growling continues]
I love zombies.
[growling continues]
Hey, what's wrong with us? Breath not bad enough for ya?
(Addy) Doc! Come on!
Radio must be in there somewhere.
Any locals?
Puppy and kitten free.
Yeah, this has got to be the place.
Yeah, let's check it out.
[growling]
No, no, no, no. Remember no mercy, no killing, no piking.
What am I supposed to do? Pants him?
Yeah, sure. Can't chase us with his pants down.
Come on, sailor. Don't be shy.
Come on!
Come on.
Doc.
[gunshot]
We have work to do.
I'll put it in neutral. You two push.
Uh-uh, baby. You're pushing. I'm driving.
Nobody pops a clutch better than me.
Come on. Let's go. Come on.
[snarling]
Come on, shortpants. Push. Push!
[snarling]
What are you feeding them?
Brains.
Brains?
Where you getting brains from?
Don't worry. It's all roadkill.
Yeah, well keep pushing or we're gonna be roadkill.
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on!
Go, go, go, go.
[snarling]
Hey, hey, hey, hey. That's my job.
She's right, Sun Mei.
Addy's got mad skills when it comes to electronics.
I don't need her help.
It is your help that we do not need.
Do you even know what you're doing? This has no power.
There is now. I have a solar charger and AC inverter.
It only holds a few minutes of charge, but that should be enough to contact my ship.
Wow, that would have been nice to know.
Okay, if we have power, we have to use it to contact Citizen Z.
Your people have been zero help up until this point.
I'm sorry, but I have my mission and a chain of command to report to.
Chain of command? Your mission failed.
You do what Warren says now.
And if Warren was here she would tell us to contact Citizen Z.
Get out of the way!
No.
You will have to kill me.
Addy, maybe we need to wait till Warren gets back.
I cannot wait.
Look, the world doesn't need another zombie.
[sighs]
There's nothing broadcasting except number stations and ghosts.
That's why we have to get you back again.
Hey. It's been months since I had any contact with Operation Bite Mark, or anyone else for that matter.
Kaya, there's nobody out there.
Kaya?
[crying]
Oh no. No, don't do that.
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[crying]
No. Hey, come here. Don't cry.
Oh.
It's just that since you came here, I had hope. You know?
And without that, I don't know what happens.
[crying]
I know.
The Apocalypse sucks, huh?
[crying] Big time.
Hey, listen.
Just because Citizen Z is dead, doesn't mean hope is dead.
You're still alive.
You know?
We're still alive.
[radio static]
What is that?
I don't know.

We found a transmitter.
Sun Mei got a signal that her reinforcements were dead.
Sorry.
Any word on Citizen Z?
[whispering] No.
Damn.
Yeah.
Let's go.
[snarling]
I'll admit, I got a little crazy up at Northern Light.
All by myself. Year after year with nobody to talk to.
Solitary confinement in 65,000 square feet of military base.
All of that death and not a damn thing I could do about it except talk.
Even that didn't help much.
You know, I'm not proud of everything that I did, but I tried.
I really tried.
I gave it my all.
Now I feel like I've got nothing left to give.
You ever feel like that?
Good talk.
Wow, that looks amazing.
I'm starved after all that exercise.
God damn fuel line.
Poorly engineered hunk of junk.
Then the damn carburetor.
So, I saw you working on that seaplane.
Yeah. Lost a half a tank of fuel.
Oh sh1t. I'm sorry.
Yeah, only fuel for a one way trip.
Nowhere to go anyway.
What's this?
Dinner.
You need your strength.
Yeah, but aren't you all eating?
We've taught ourselves to live on less.
No, no, that's not right.
I can't eat all this while you guys have nothing. No, no.
Here. Nana, have some fish. Here you go Really. It's okay.
No. Not okay.
I made it for you.
[burping]
You guys are starving.
How much food do you have left?
That's it?
That's a few months at best, without me.
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.
I'm pretty sure the Apocalypse is not your fault.
I know where there's more food.
[snarling]
Mrs. Macgillicuddy! What are you doing?
Why are we stopping?
This will just take two seconds.
Getting killed takes one second!
Well I can't just leave her like that! She's a librarian!
What?
Uh, zombies!
[snarling]
[snarling]
[snarling]
[snarling]
Does anyone else wonder why all these Zs don't give a damn about us? They only want the postman there?
I had the same thought.
They focus on him to the exclusion of all other stimuli.
Yeah. What she said.
[snarling]
It's because he feeds them. They just want his bag of chum.
It's not the food they're after.
I'll meet you back at the post office!
I think we need to take a closer look at Mr. Mailman.
Wait just a minute.
I remember this.
The Museum of Progress. Expo 74. Wait till you see.
There's all kinds of cool futuristic stuff that we can use What happened here?
Looters.
Well that's progress for you.
Promising.
Looters really stripped this place clean.
They use every part of the buffalo. But hey, it saves us having to clear out the old future to make room for the future.
Dead body here and there.
But otherwise, not bad.
Place has good bones.
Plenty of room to expand.
Dr. Merch, this could be your lab.
And this someday soon will be Lucy's room.
Lucy?
She's alive?
No, I fed her to the Zs on a cracker.
Of course she's alive.
I did what I had to do at the time because I couldn't trust certain people.
Things are different now.
We're putting down roots.
A girl should grow up with a father.
Look at those windows.
This definitely reads inner sanctum.
Love the sound of a waterfall.
Maybe I'll even sleep at night.
Endless fresh water.
We can grow our own crops.
Even generate power again someday.
The building's defensible.
See my whole world from here.
And this?
This shall be my throne room.
We're home.
Did he just say throne room?
[muffled screaming and grunting]
[muffled screaming and grunting]
[muffled sounds of struggle]
[screaming and grunting]
[screaming and grunting]
[gunshot]
So. This is an Ender, huh?
Sure he's human?
Barely.
What are you gonna do to him?
Shoot him.
You crazy? No.
I asked nicely.
Shoot him.
You're not the boss of me.
Sure about that?
More sure than anything in my life.
Shoot him.
No.
Shoot him.
No!
Shoot him!
No!
Shoot him!
No!
Silly boy.
Kids.
Shouldn't play with guns.
Even ones that aren't...
[gunshot]
Loaded.
Somebody clean that up.
[growling]
Something wrong?
That would be a big mistake.
You open up your home to people, and this is what you get.
Don't worry. You'll get your gun back.
Maybe.
We just wanna ask you a few questions.
Why are these undead attracted to you?
I told you.
After being friends for so many years, somewhere deep down they still know who I am. They love me.
Zombies love one thing. Brains.
Trust me, brother. They are not your friends.
Check him for bites.
No bites.
Or signs of infection.
You ever met someone named Murphy?
Who?
Blue guy. Yea tall.
Ever been clawed by a zombie? Exchange bodily fluids?
No, of course not. I'd be a zombie.
Any sexual contact with the undead?
What? Sexual contact? Hey, what is this? Who are you people?
I need to take blood.
I can field test it for antibodies.
Come on.
See if there's something about his blood that attracts Zs.
Seriously?
You think Murphy and Becker... you know?
I don't know what to think. Blood will tell us more.
Negative. He hasn't been bitten.
Everything else within normal levels.
I need to run another blood panel.
Look for exposure to other vaccines.
Maybe another disease is a cofactor.
I don't know who you are or what you think my blood is going to tell you.
But I want you out of here. You've got your gas.
I'll give you food. But then you've got to go.
Lead on.
Can I have my gun back?
No.
This is a fully stocked civil defense emergency shelter for the entire county.
Enough food and water for hundreds of people.
Nobody lived long enough to use it.
This way.
I always forget which key it is. Can you hold the light?
Hey, Addy.
Shine your Swiss Army Whacker over this way.
Oh, hello.
We got a dead body back here.
Just a poor mercied mail carrier.
Nothing to worry about.
There's another one in here.
Shot in the head.
Hey, Mr. Postmaster. Who killed the mailmen?
They all have headshots, but they hadn't turned yet.
[growling]
[yelling]
[growling]
[growling]
[glass shattering]
[growling]
[growling]
[growling]
[growling]
Don't you look at me!
Don't... you... look... at... me!
[yelling] You see! You see!
[growling]
[growling]
[growling]
[growling]
[thud]
[growling]
[growling]
[crash]
[growling]
Special delivery.
[gunshot]
Everyone okay?
Yeah. Where's Warren?
In here!
Meet the real Postmaster Walter J. Becker.
Shot in the heart.
Same as all the other friends and neighbors.
These people didn't all just die. They were executed.
Looks like somebody went postal.
[snarling]
[snarling continues]
[beeping]
Let me guess.
Your tests came back negative.
These zombies don't follow you because of anything in your blood.
I tried to tell you.
Now I'll just have to show you.
[whispering] Go. Go, go, go.
What is this?
I believe the correct term is abattoir.
That means slaughterhouse.
I know what it means.
It means you're insane.
Compared to who?
You're the people on a mission to find a blue messiah.
These aren't my people.
These are all strangers sent here by fate like you.
They died so my friends could live.
A source of brains other than my own for them to eat.
They aren't your friends and neighbors.
They're your trophies.
I knew you were the smart one.
That's why I picked you.
You have a big brain.
You don't have to do this.
I can help you. With your work.
No. You're just like the others.
The truth is...
I hated these people.
Seventeen years I delivered their postcards from vacations I would never go on.
Their birthday cards I never got.
Oh, the love letters that the women in this town would never write to someone like me.
I'm just the mailman.
I'm just the one who's late with your check.
The one with the junkmail and the catalogs.
I'm just the one stepping in dog sh1t [yelling] because they won't lock up their god damn dogs.
So, when Day One came to McCloud, I knew what to do.
I shot them.
Every man, woman, and child.
Starting with my boss.
I shot them in the heart so I could watch them turn.
Now listen to them.
Now they know who I am.
The last thing they saw before they turned.
But, they have to be fed.
So if you wouldn't mind...
[gun cocking]
What are you gonna do with that?
Stay back.
It's locked.
[gunshot]
[growling]
No! No!
[screaming]
[growling and munching]
You're alive?
We thought you were Becker.
He's a wacko killer.
That dude's mail is certifiable.
He's dead.
You killed him?
You killed shortpants?
Not precisely.
But he will be spending much more quality time with his friends and neighbors.
[wind blowing]
Hey!
[wind blowing]
You okay?
[wind blowing]
We're not far now!
I can see it!
[wind blowing]
[snarling]
So if it wasn't his blood, and it sure as sh1t wasn't his personality, what was it that made the zombies want him so bad?
He was the last thing they saw before they died.
Maybe deep down in their soul they still hated him.
Zombies don't have a soul.
Then why do we give them mercy?
That mailman licked the wrong stamp.
[snarling]
Something about this feels so right.
There's somebody here to see you.
Who is it?
The family with the sick little girl.
The road hogs? Send them away.
We just wanted to thank you.
Thank me?
For giving us back our little girl.
Bite is getting better.
Well good. I'm happy to hear that.
It's not just that she's cured. It's more than that.
She's not afraid anymore.
It's a miracle.
We just have one more favor we'd like to ask.
Would you bite my wife?
