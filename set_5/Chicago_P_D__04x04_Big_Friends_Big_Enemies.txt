[/i][indistinct chatter]
Thank God that's over.
I mean, how many encores can one person do?
[sighs]
[chuckles]
So, what, you avoiding going home already?
What?
Dude, I'm working overtime so we can pay off my place faster.
It's your place.
Our place.
Uh-huh.
It's been four days.
Well, still.
What?
Nothing.
I'm not avoiding going home, I...
You know, out of all of my friends, I am not going to take relationship insight from you.
No, no, no. What? No, see...
No.
Erin, you don't want to get punched in the face, you got to talk to the guy with the broken schnoz.
Okay.
You know.
Sure.
I'm just lookin' out for ya.
That's all.
You can learn from my mistakes.
I just think you and Halstead should have a plan.
Dude, you and Burgess had the ultimate plan.
What happened?
That's a fair enough point.
[gunfire, screaming]
Go, go!
[panicked shouting]
[gunshot]
Get down!
[indistinct shouting]
Police! Get down!
Everybody down!
Down! Everybody down!
Everybody, get down!
Get down!
Get down, get down!
Get down! Stay down!
[gunshot]
Get down!
[gunfire]
Get down!
[screaming]
Get down!
[gunshot]
[indistinct shouting]
I don't have a shot!
[tires squealing]
Lincoln 5021, we have shots fired at the Riviera.
Offender in a black SUV, fleeing southbound on Broadway.
Roll ambulances to our location.
4698 North Broadway.
We have multiple victims.
Gunshot wounds, struck by vehicle... we need help!
[sirens wailing]
[indistinct chatter]
Uh, let's set up the command post here on Broadway, staging center for victims off of Lawrence.
Hey... no one leaves, you understand?
Get a statement from everyone.
Copy that.
Single car.
Yeah.
Driver was the only shooter.
He opened up on the crowd from inside the vehicle.
Yeah, we got multiple people shot, multiple people run down.
This guy, he drove right through the crowd.
It looked like Nice, boss.
Well, until we know what this is, I'm initiating a plan three.
Get a street deputy down here, notify ICE, Homeland, FBI.
Kevin, I want you to clear this entire crime scene.
Only medics.
Okay, let's go.
I need everybody off the streets.
I need you to gather everybody past Lawrence for me.
Is she hurt?
No.
No? Okay, can you follow those officers for me?
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.
[wincing]
[i][groaning]
[grunts]
Hey, hey. Hey, no, no, no, don't move.
Don't move, don't move, don't move.
I'm the police.
I'm the police... you gonna be okay.
All right, all right.
Okay, I got you. I got you.
I need some help over here!
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm on the job! Get me a medic!
I need a medic right now!
[groans]
Please... not like... not like this.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's not gonna be like this. Okay?
It's not gonna be like this. I got you.
I got you, okay?
Look at me, look at me, open your eyes.
Look at me. Right? Okay?
Stay right here, look... look at me, look at me.
Look at me! Look at me.
Huh? I'm right here, okay?
Let's keep it right here.
Let's keep it right here, little homey.
You got it, okay?
Stay strong, little homey, come on.
Come on, man.
We got six injuries, two clipped by the van, four shot.
All non-life-threatening, except the boy in the alley.
The kid was one of the rappers performing.
Took two shots, center mass.
Shooter knew what he was doing, too.
I mean, he knew exactly when the concert was getting out.
Hey, what you got?
Witnesses say the shooter was parked at the curb, he opened fire near the side entrance, then drove into the crowd.
You got a description yet?
Nothing.
People were running, there was rapid fire, a muzzle flash... no one could see.
Anyone heard the offender say anything?
Pledge any allegiance?
Didn't say a word, just fired.
Now, we've got a score of witnesses saying the shooter was masked, but just as many insisting he was Muslim.
All right, you run command and activate pinpoint.
We'll run parallel.
Guy's still out there; we need to worry about a secondary attack.
How long before a terrorist group would claim something like this?
Usually pretty fast.
Patrol found the SUV.
It was torched in a parking garage off of Southport.
Shooter tried to remove the VIN number, but he didn't know about the one on the frame.
It's registered to a Greg Penley.
Guy's got a prior for a hate crime.
How 'bout that?
TV's been on in the living room since we got here.
We've not seen anyone in or out.
No cars in the garage. We ran everything you asked.
No one should be in the home but Penley.
All right, let's do this.
[doorbell rings]
Good evening, sir, we are with the Chicago PD.
We've been notified that there's a gas leak in the area.
We need to evacuate the block as a precaution.
A gas leak?
Yeah, if you just step outside, we'll get the fire team in and clear your home as quickly as possible.
Yeah, I need to grab some stuff, first.
Just step outside, sir.
Just don't...
Outside.
Nice and easy.
Get down on your knees.
Give me those hands. Let me see your hands.
You tell me!
You're never getting out of here until you come clean.
And I mean, like, never getting out.
I didn't do anything! I've been at home.
Ten years ago, you were convicted of assault with a deadly weapon for smashing a Pakistani shopkeeper's skull in with a baseball bat while shouting racial slurs.
And I did my time for that.
I was young.
[yelps]
That ain't youth. That's hate.
Call it what you want, I'm not like that...
Then how'd your car end up at a mass shooting?
What?
I have no idea!
Someone must've stolen it.
And you didn't notice, didn't report it?
I keep it parked in a crappy lot.
On the West side.
I barely use it in the city. [choking]
I use it to go up to my ma's place, up in Michigan.
I had nothing to do with this!
I got a half a dozen people being treated at Chicago Med, one of 'em a 16-year-old boy who is clinging to life.
So you're gonna lose the wide-eyed act... and you're gonna get real honest.
Real fast.
I swear on my mother's life.
I had a pizza delivered around 10:00.
I can give you the name of the place.
Uh, Sarge, we got something you need to see.
[gagging, grunts]
So CPIC said they noticed it about 20 minutes ago.
Since then, I found 13 posts.
This profile belonging to a banger with the G Park Lords was the first.
"TK Ice, bitch thought he tough, but we SHK. G Park Lords gun that punk down. That's right, we get to you anywhere, even when you think you made.
Bang bang, bitch."
TK Ice is the 16-year-old victim from the alley.
His real name is Terrel Kenton.
He's a rapper from the South Side.
His lyrics are violent, but he's got a clean record.
I mean, the kid's from Englewood, so even with no priors, a rapper from that neighborhood is definitely connected to the Southside Hustlers.
I mean, everything runs through the gang.
Everything from the manager, to the label, to the artist...
So if he was our target, this whole thing... the multiple casualties, fleeing into the crowd...
Wait, so we're saying a banger drove all the way to a concert on the North side, shot up a whole crowd of people, just to get to some 16-year-old rapper?
They were looking to send a message.
Even if this kid's not a banger, that hit's a pretty big show of muscle.
I'm gonna have the gang unit send us all the territorial conflicts.
All right, somebody build me a profile on this kid okay?
What do you want to do with the owner of the SUV?
Check his alibi, corroborate the stolen car.
If it syncs, kick him.
Got it.
Guys, we got a shooting in G Park territory.
We got more bodies.
All right, run this whole thing down with the FBI.
We might not be looking at terrorism.
This could be a gang war.
Hey.
Homicide thinks this is retaliation for TK's shooting.
Now, the shooters came from that gangway.
And they just opened fire.
This one was shot in the back first.
Hmm.
His buddy had enough time to grab his weapon, but he didn't get a shot off.
And the woman across the way... was just returning from work.
This guy doesn't have any ink.
He was ID'd as G Park Lords?
Loosely... I mean, he lives up the block, but gang unit says he wasn't a heavy hitter.
That's a lot of rounds.
Yeah.
20 slugs in the tree.
See, I don't think these guys had anything to do with shooting TK.
Whoever did this just wanted bodies.
Hey.
Any witnesses?
Neighbors said it was too dark to see.
Everyone on the block was sleeping.
Woke up to gunfire.
Damage was done by an assault rifle.
I've seen too much of this.
[child crying]
Sarge, this can go sideways six ways till sundown.
Yeah.
Sarge.
Yeah?
You're not gonna believe this.
Video was posted live, just got shared.
[gunfire continues]
[gunfire continues]
Area central's gang enforcement tracked the video, picked up the two Southside Hustlers responsible.
Still had the guns on them.
Both of 'em lawyered up just as soon as they got the cuffs on 'em and neither one of 'em is saying a word.
All right, so what's the traction on the video?
84 posts so far, and they're all direct call outs.
Direct threats.
So this is a gang war now.
All right, bring in someone from CPIC, we got to track this in real time.
Every one of those posts could be a hit.
All right, this is TK's manager.
Mark Cains, aka "Markey."
Now, Markey's a Southside heavyweight.
Since TK signed with him, the kid's been picked up by patrol three times.
He always skates off, but the arrest records are who's who.
Big friends, big enemies.
All right, so far, it looks like the gunners are members of one of three G Park Lord factions.
Three Corner Kings, 71st Street Rollers, and the Shreveport Knights.
We got to narrow it down from there.
That area's always hot.
I mean, you got the three G Park factions and the Southside Hustlers in a 12 block radius.
It could easily be a retaliation for some online beef or power struggle.
If we're looking for enemies, Markey's label is no joke.
He gets talented kids to rap about violence, brings in cash.
And if TK is a rapper for Markey, he's making more than music.
He's definitely making enemies.
[key tapping]
He's making gangsters out of kids.
It's a wonder he got shot.
A victim's a victim.
All right, get all of patrol to flood the zone.
We got two priorities now.
Locate TK's shooter, and keep this neighborhood from going up in flames.
Hey, I was just calling to check in on you all.
Uh...
Something popping off at work, so...
I'm gonna need you to call me.
Call me as soon as you can.
[knocks lightly]
Hi.
You're, uh, you're Jenny Barcles from CPIC?
Yup.
Was I supposed to tell someone I was here?
Uh, just me, yeah.
Okay, so you're who I should talk to?
Yeah.
I've narrowed down likely next targets and shooters.
It should be printing.
Okay, so this is the strategic subject list?
No, I'm not printing you that list.
How do people always think data is king?
Predictive analytics is only as good as the person reading it.
That's your copy. What's your name?
Um, Adam.
Adam, can I eat the food in the fridge?
Sure, if you're hungry. Yeah, sure.
Sure.
Uh, there's 22 names on this list.
Well, it's easier to narrow once more bodies drop, but the point's to prevent that from happening.
We slim it, predict it... who, where, when.
Okay.
A list?
Yes, ma'am.
Your son's been identified by the CPD as a potential suspect in future gang violence.
You saying he's done something?
No, not yet.
'Cause it sounds like you're accusing him.
We believe he's likely to commit or have violence committed against him in the very near future.
We got boys dying on these streets, and you all here, asking me questions?
We would like to relocate both you and your son.
CPD will move you for a few nights...
No, no, no, y'all got to leave.
I can take care of myself.
Were you not online posting threats?
Yeah, you could get killed. That's why we're here.
Jordan?
What're you doing here?
Hey! Uh-uh.
You're coming with me.
What're you doing?
You can't take...
Yes I can. Tell her.
It's fine. I know her.
I don't understand.
We thought this was some kind of terrorist attack.
How could our boy be involved in this?
We have reason to believe that TK was actually the target.
Do you know anyone that he was having problems with?
No. No.
Anybody that he was beefing with online, or... or calling out in his music?
No, I...
I'm sorry, I don't listen to his music.
Ma'am, do you know how long your son's been a member of the Southside Hustlers?
That's what you want from me?
We already have three people that are dead.
My son is a good boy.
Those people are his friends.
They're also members of a violent street gang.
He's a child!
An hour ago...
I thought you would find his shooter.
Now I know you won't.
This is the South side of Chicago.
Murder's always free here.
Sir...
No, sir.
Okay.
So let me get this straight.
TK, who is your artist, was walking out of the venue into two vehicles that you had waiting on him and you weren't anywhere to be found.
What were you doing... catching a cab?
Taking a bus home, what?
I was at the merch table.
Checking receipts.
And you haven't heard anything?
Not even on the streets?
Like I said to all your other guys, I don't know nothing.
Okay, well, I know who you are, Markey.
And I understand that you might try to handle this on your own, but I guarantee you we'll do a better job, dog.
I got nothing else to say.
We done?
Yeah, for now.
[sighs]
Anything?
No, man, it's been, like, a stretch of 11 open homicides in that neighborhood over the past month.
I don't think anybody's saying anything.
This is totally unnecessary!
I wasn't even doing anything, you can't do this...
Shut up! It's enough.
After everything your brother's done for you, everything Kevin sacrificed, I find you, while I'm on the job, hanging with those boys?
All you should be saying to me right now is "I'm sorry, I screwed up."
Okay!
Hey, Jordan.
You shouldn't be out there, okay?
It's not who you are.
All right. I'm sorry.
Yeah, that was TK two years ago.
He won the school talent show.
Then Markey got ahold of him.
Huh.
Just a good kid in with the wrong people.
Hey, boss.
We got something. Tell me.
Take it away there, Jenny.
Uh, yeah, uh, so... so, bangers use a certain syntax, language... mostly letters, a shorthand.
Certain bangers have certain voices.
Makes it easy for us to track them over multiple profiles.
But there were some that popped up right after TK's shooting.
We noticed a few I didn't recognize, and, uh... you're Voight?
Hank Voight? Correct.
I worked in the Ivory Tower for a spell.
I've read a lot of files on you, I guess you'd say... a lot of allegations.
Huh.
Okay, um... we, uh, tracked the first two profiles to post after TK's shooting.
Uh, they've also been the most dominant.
One belongs to a G Park Lord, the other to a Southside Hustler.
Jenny here tracked down the IP address and they match.
Two opposing gangs making posts from the same place.
So that means that one person started this and is stoking the others.
So we got somebody purposefully fueling a gang war?
Last inflammatory post was made from an IP address belonging to Charles Backer.
He's a black male, mid-40s.
History of gang violence?
He grew up in Englewood.
All right, get an LKA, have Antonio and Olinsky hit it.
Got it.
They're all true.
Got something.
Chicago PD!
[shrieks]
Charlie posted the place online and I needed a cheap place to rent.
He hasn't been by at all, I swear.
I just mail a check.
What about you guys?
You're her roommates?
I'm her boyfriend.
I'm nobody.
We're gonna need a little bit more than that.
Really?
Look, I don't know what you think you saw, but just so you know, nothing was happening between me and him.
Who has the keys?
Just me.
I'm not an idiot... I don't go handing my keys out.
Of course not.
By the way, this was completely consensual.
By the way, we don't care.
What about your internet?
You share the Wi-Fi with the neighbors?
Really? Can you even do that?
No, it's just us.
Tenants' phones and computers check out, but this house has been rented out 10 different times in the last four years, which means a hundred different people could have used it and got the Wi-Fi password.
So, best guess is, whoever's making the posts is mobile.
Drives up, makes the post, rolls out.
And there's no traffic cameras on this street.
No, whoever's behind this wants to keep bodies dropping, so they're gonna be back.
All right, have Antonio and Al sit on the location.
All right.
Maybe you should work downstairs?
Yes, sir.
[muttering indistinctly]
Hey, Kevin, hang back.
What's going on?
Tay.
Burgess picked up Jordan.
What do you mean she picked up Jordan?
Is he okay?
Yeah, he's fine.
We were visiting potential shooters and targets and Burgess found him hanging out with a friend.
The friend was on our list.
Kevin, TK's out of surgery. We're heading to Med.
It's all right, Kim's got him.
But I should... I should probably stay...
Burgess has it.
She already cleared it with me.
She's got it handled, Kevin.
Go on.
Go do your job.
Go on.
Hey.
Hey, I was just gonna call ya.
The surgeons managed to repair the damage internally, but he lost too much blood.
It was too late.
He went into DIC.
[sighs]
All right, thanks, Maggie.
Yeah.
I can have Dr. Halstead brief you.
No, it's all right. Thanks.
All right.
Excuse me.
Hey, Markey, can I lecture you for a minute, man?
Whatever, toy cop.
No, listen to me, bro...
Keep your hands off me, man.
Bro, listen to me, man!
Huh? You gonna listen?
Kevin...
Because I was there.
When TK was dying, I watched that scared kid bleed out next to the trash, man.
You shoved this life down his throat.
Why?
To fill your pockets?
Let him go.
Huh? This is on you!
Yeah, whatever, man.
Toy cop.
Kevin.
Let's get out of here. Come on.
Yeah?
The G Park Lords are posting up.
We got a retaliation hit coming.
Uh, looks like maybe 71st and Stewart.
Let's do this.
[tires screeching]
He lives off 71st and Racine.
Got two cousins on the same street a block over.
All of them could be targets.
Hold up, hold up.
Move, move, move!
[tires screeching]
5021 George, emergency.
Dark green sedan fleeing westbound.
Are you all right?
We fine.
We fine.
Can I get a mobile with 5021?
Yeah, go for 5021.
Copy.
Do you think they even know who they were gonna shoot at?
You know, back at the crime scene, when you said that you've seen too much of this...
I was just running my mouth, I'm fine.
This could be our guy.
Latino?
Both social media profiles are posting live.
That's got to be him.
Want to take him?
No.
Let's tail his ass.
All right, 7113.
Get on the horn with HIDTA.
Run the location.
Hey, this is Detective Dawson, Intelligence.
Followed a priority target in real time.
We need to de-conflict the location.
7113 Morgan Street.
There's three direct conflicts at this address for narcotics.
Tied to the Latin Players.
It's probably a stash house.
Thanks, I'll reach out.
On your knees.
Quite the left hook there, Antonio.
Yeah.
Get up.
Latin Players.
There's a third gang behind this.
Hi.
Luis Garza.
Affiliated with the Latin Players.
What were you doing posting social media from G Park Lords and Southside profiles?
Hey, listen, you want us to talk for you?
All right, that's fine.
We can do that.
You know what I think?
I think you saw TK.
Maybe it was 'cause he was fronting.
Maybe it's 'cause he was making something of himself.
Whatever it was, you saw a kid whose death would shatter that block.
So you drove down to his concert, and you shot him.
Then you hid behind your computer, prodding for more.
Mm, with enough bangers shot or picked up, take over some territory.
We close yet?
[scoffs] All this over a couple of dope corners.
Mm-hmm.
Baby...
I'll tell ya the problem with letting us speak for you.
We get to say how it ends.
[sighs]
I didn't kill nobody.
I was out with my girl when that rapper got shot.
Oh, he was out with his girl.
Then why were you making those posts?
Talking trash.
Being a troll ain't a crime.
Luis.
You got a lot more skin in the game than that, baby.
Oh, you can go ahead and skip to it.
Skip to what?
The part where you uncuff me and say I swung at you.
That's not gonna work, neither.
[laughs]
Oh, baby.
Get where he was with his girlfriend.
[laughs]
It checks out.
He was out with his girlfriend at a diner on Wabash from 10:00 p.m. to 11:45. and she corroborates.
And two waiters.
Checking all numbers called, all historical cell sites.
All right, I want a full profile.
Arrest records, cell mates, his family, roommates.
Anybody who came within spitting distance of him.
I tracked the serial number off Garza's laptop.
It was purchased in cash at a pawn store in Will County.
The buyer didn't match Garza's description.
The store sent this over.
Can you enhance that photo?
No, it goes to snow.
The store owner says his receipts show that this guy bought the laptop, a video game, a bag of chips, and a box of 223 rounds, same used in the shooting.
Guy got ID, I ran it, came back bogus.
Why don't we put that guy through facial recognition and cross-reference him with Garza's known associates?
Nah, there's no time for that.
I got this.
I'll go with you, Sarge.
No, you stay put.
Because?
'Cause I said so.
There he is.
You guys give us a second?
Appreciate it.
What's up, Mal?
Voight.
I got this little theory I've been working on.
Feel pretty good about it, too.
See this guy?
That's the kid that shot that rapper.
Started all that violence over on 73rd.
And then he hires this guy...
Luis Garza, to go online, and fire up a war between two gangs, neither one of 'em his... or yours, I should say.
Now, Chicago PD has been devoting a lot of resources to these two warring gangs.
And they're about to be turned on yours.
We are gonna hit your streets hard.
Knock down every door.
And I'm gonna personally make sure we pay particular attention to Stewart Street, your cousin's place off 71st, that house you put your ma up at.
Eggleston and 69th, where your girlfriend and your child sleep.
Or you can give us the name and location of this guy.
We'd cap the arrest, no one has to know.
There are families getting killed.
Hey.
I got no problem coming after yours.
That guy's small dice.
Both of them are.
Maybe it was a half-cooked plan to catch a rep and move on up... but they both had no permission.
Uh-huh.
Name's Alex.
He hangs with the boys at the pool hall on 70.
Yeah?
Now we're getting somewhere.
[phone dialling]
Players run this place off the books, so there's bound to be plenty of bangers inside armed and high.
So we don't make a sound; no one knows we're here.
We lure Alex out on Voight's cue; we take him.
If he's not alone, we take whoever's with him.
You two take the front.
Ruzek, cover the side.
Jay and I have the back.
We're set.
Copy.
It's your moment.
I want to see every letter before you press send.
Okay.
Sent.
Eyes open, target's been warned.
Go.
Chicago PD... keep your mouth shut, don't move.
Stop moving!
♪
Turn around.
Put your hands on the car.
You got ID?
Spread your legs.
That's our guy.
Hands behind your back.
[sobs]
He's just a kid.
All right, let's go.
Go.
I'm getting my gat back before I go.
Shut up, just go.
I tell ya, 15 years ago, I would've played this a lot different.
I'd just work my way up the ladder, making arrests till some shot-caller stomped it all down to keep business rolling.
Well, we're not there anymore.
No, sir, we ain't.
I mean, now I'm just a guy sitting in front of a computer that predicts which child's gonna be shot next.
It's a whole new thing.
I'm here to tell you, you both got played.
Park Lords didn't hit TK, someone else did, to pit you against each other.
Then who the hell did it?
You know I can't tell you that.
But I can tell you... that you played right into their hands.
Look, I know you're gonna do what you're gonna do, but... this is your neighborhood, this is your families getting shot up.
And we got the offender, he's in custody.
So now this is about nothing.
Nothing.
And that's the truth.
All right, man.
You're still here?
Yeah, I'm heading out.
Just making sure the radios are quiet.
Heard Markey already jacked up the prices on TK's music, so kid's about to be famous.
Yeah.
I'll never understand it like you do.
That doesn't mean I won't pull you from the edge when I have to.
You got to care and not care at the same time, I guess.
That's exactly right.
That's exactly right.
It's just tough sometimes, Sarge.
Yeah.
I'm glad you're in my unit, Kevin.
[indistinct chatter]
Two children were shot this weekend as gang violence erupted in the streets of Chicago.
The latest wave of attacks started when Chicago rapper, TK Ice, was gunned down in a drive-by shooting...
[door opens]
Hey.
Hey.
I appreciate you.
Yeah.
I've always got your back. You know that, man.
Yeah.
Come here.
Thank you.
He's in his room.
[sighs]
Kevin.
Your brother's a good kid.
Yeah, I know.
[door opens and shuts]
[sighs]
Bro.
Kim brought Jordan home in a squad car.
She didn't have the lights on, but I mean, she hauled him in here.
It was insane.
She called him a dumbass.
Hey, dumbass.
Shut up!
Look, I was just out for two seconds.
Was just gonna check on a friend, that's it.
Man, you know... you know those lists are straight BS, anyways.
Cops never get 'em right.
My bad.
But I swear... I swear none of those guys were gonna go out.
[sighs]
Y'all hungry?
Aren't you tired?
Nah.
I think we should get something to eat.
I could eat.
Let's eat.
Let's go.
Come on, hurry up. You're hungry, right?
Yeah.
All right then.
