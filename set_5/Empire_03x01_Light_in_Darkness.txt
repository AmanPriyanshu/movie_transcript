Jamal!
Mom.
I'm pregnant. It's Hakeem's.
My baby, he is making me believe in myself again.
He?
This is Leah Walker, Lucious's mother.
You have no idea what you've done.
What's your half brother Tariq doing here?
Look, I know you're a Fed.
You better not be putting the squeeze on my family.
I had to put in work on a couple of cats.
The three horsemen who wanted us dead.
: Well, there was a fourth horsemen.
But Shine, he ain't gonna snitch.
Anika Calhoun, you've been served.
See you in court.
‭What?
This isn't gonna be my life, I'm sorry.
If Anika and I get married...
‭Wait... what?
.. the Feds can't force her to testify.
Y'all know I love you, right?
But me and your daddy...
I can't do this no more.
Get your hands off me!
: You may kiss the bride.
I know you pushed me, bitch!
(groaning)
(screaming)
No!
: Hakeem, wait!
Leave me alone!
Hakeem.
‭Shut up.
Bring your ass back here.
(tires squealing)
Look at all these damn people out here.
Any one of them could be Feds.
Son, you know what?
Get my mama home.
Makes sure she's comfortable and calm, okay, when she goes to bed.
Come on, Grandma.
Okay, where's Andre?
(crash and glass shattering)
(chorus singing "Exclamavit")
(screaming): No!
Move.
Oh, my God.
Rhonda!
Rhonda!
‭Oh, my God!
Andre!
(sobbing): Andre!
Andre!
What did you do?!
(sobbing)
What did you do?
You killed my wife!
She attacked me, Andre.
(liquid splattering)
(sobbing)
She attacked me, Andre.
My water.
(crying): My water.
Please, help.
Help me.
Come on.
(sobbing)
Help!
(phone buzzing)
Hello.
Jamal.
Wait, wh... what hospital?
What?
Okay.
I-I'm on my way.
(rhythmic knocking on door)
What the hell?
Oh, God.
What do you want, Hakeem?
I got it all wrong.
I'm here to get it right.
Uh, you need...
Hakeem.
What?
What are you doing?
You know I always loved you, but that bitch curved me at the altar.
I'm sorry, but you can't... no.
No, no, no, no.
No. Put your... no.
Pull-pull up your pants.
Put your pants back on.
Look, you know I always loved you.
(sighs)
(exhaling): Oh, God.
(phone buzzing)
(indistinct PA announcements)
: Andre, baby?
Here are Rhonda's things.
Andre.
You know we're gonna take good care of you.
You know that, right?
Look, there's a chapel in the hospital.
We can go pray.
I'll call Reverend Pryce.
No.
Are you sure?
Dre, it may help you.
Yeah.
What's he gonna do?
Tell me this is all a part of God's plan?
I'm done with God.
Andre.
And his plans.
No.
He can use his plans for somebody else.
No, Andre, you don't mean that.
We're being punished.
We're all being punished.
Shut up with all of that.
Shh.
Where's Hakeem?
Your brother's a selfish son of a bitch.
Dad, seriously. Not now.
Those aren't Feds.
: All right, ready?
(overlapping speaking)
Okay. Yeah, excellent.
Okay, I'm just gonna... very good.
Push. Good progress.
(groaning)
The baby's crowning.
(yelling)
: Sir, I'm sorry, unless you're the father, I'm gonna have to ask you...
That's my wife.
‭DOCTOR: We're in the home stretch, Dad.
Where's my mother?
How's the baby?
: Six weeks premature.
We've got an incubator at the ready, but so far so good.
Breathe.
(Anika moaning)
: And... push.
(groaning) LUCIOUS: Anika, you can do it.
Push. You can do it.
Can I touch her?
You got it, you got it.
Push.
Push, push baby, that's it.
That's it, that's it.
All right, breathe.
Speaking of push, you see the cops out the window right now?
Nobody pushed Rhonda.
She jumped, you tried to stop her.
She overpowered you, tried to take you with her.
Grabbed you by the throat, which is what's going to happen, if you don't go with the story.
You hear me?
Very good. Not too much pressure.
Okay?
One final push.
(groaning)
Push, push.
Push.
(screaming)
Oh, hello.
Oh.
(Anika crying)
Congratulations.
It's a girl.
You want to cut the cord, Dad?
No.
You lied to me.

Put some money where your mouth is.
Let's start with a stack.
Well, you know, I like big spenders, why don't we throw your whole catalog on the table?
My catalog.
Nephew.
What my catalog got to do with this table right now?
Y'all know I'm relaunching Swiftstream under a brand new banner called Empire XStream?
And I want to make an offer for exclusive rights to your music.
'Cause I know how to get a brother paid.
Is that right?
My pipeline brings the revenue directly from the subscriber right to your pocket.
No middle man.
I mean, what do we look like, selling our catalogs to you?
For your streaming service, when Empire's falling to the bottom of the ocean, man?
Ain't nothing happening.
Your stock down... Everything about you is going to the bottom of the ocean.
You're a Titanic boat.
You're right where the anchor's at.
I know y'all think you're all smelling blood in the water, but you better check your own damn panties.
'Cause I don't lose.
I always ride the wave, because I am the king.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
This man did not say he's the king.
30 solid years in this game.
How could he be the king?
If he the king, then what are we?
But how can a king be a king when he lose his queen?
Make me understand that.
When she stood there and watched you marry your ex, that's a bad vibe, if you ask me.
What's the king without a queen, man?
Wait till I launch.
I'm gonna turn all of Time Square into my bitch... I'm talking about every screen.
And y'all gonna wish then that y'all had made this deal.
♪ ♪
All right, where in the hell is Andre?
Really, man?
He's probably...
Hey.
Your son lost his wife.
On top of all the horrible things you did to him, Lucious, give the boy the chance to grieve, okay?
Either one of you heard from him?
I talked him into coming to stay with me so he wouldn't be alone.
Okay.
So, he's getting by.
Tell him we missed him here today.
Yeah, tell him that.
And tell him I'm sorry we... had to deal with work while he's still grieving.
You tell him that, okay?
: Worried about work?
You think this is just about business, man?
This is our legacy that's on the line.
Now, this launch we've been planning, it's got to make a statement.
Jamal, we need you to perform.
You're the hero now, we got to lean into that.
Ooh, I got an idea.
How about I perform?
Give 'em something real.
How about you show up not smelling like some liquor?
Hey, I'm tired of you disrespecting me.
I'm a grown-ass man.
Well, grown-ass men don't miss the birth of their children.
So is that why you put your name on the birth certificate?
To teach me a lesson?
Look, you get your daughter back when you start acting like her father.
But it's my daughter.
Well, not according to the birth certificate.
Yeah, we'll see.
‭COOKIE: Sit down.
Hakeem, sit down.
‭Or what?
I don't see no brooms around here.
Oh, Lord, Hakeem.
What you gonna beat me with now, Ma?
Come on.
Oh, no, you grown.
You grown. We heard you.
You grown.
I'm done beating your ass.
You the one runnin' round here talking about respect...
You can be a deadbeat if you want to, but if you don't step up...
...you gonna lose my respect.
Yeah, that's right.
Whatever, I'm in the studio.
Run on out of here like a little girl.
Come on, come on.
I'll talk to him. ‭Okay.
Well, go get his ass.
I will.
Thank you for having my back.
I don't have your back, Lucious.
(Cookie chuckles)
I'm barely trying to keep it together around here.
Well, at least Jamal's in line.
So, what do you think?
Is he ready?
You know what happened to him at that wedding.
He didn't perform and sing and jump around like a little monkey when you commanded him to?
He was sick to his stomach watching you marry his brother's baby mama.
Oh, Lord, this family.
I swear. Mm.
See, there it is.
And why are you grinning like The Joker?
'Cause I know we still good as long as I see that fire in your eyes.
I need you to hear me loud and clear, Lucious.
What me and you had is dead.
Don't say that.
Yeah, you married now.
You ruined it.
Forever.

Oh, my God, that weave was sitting on top of her head looking like a parrot.
‭And y'all remember Tariq?
He thought it was a parrot.
And then he kept wondering, "Why ain't the parrot repeating what I say?"
(laughs)
Didn't her and Tariq get together at some point?
Yeah, I remember.
They made a funny-looking couple.
: They did.
Tariq and... what?
(both laughing)
Hmm.
What?
Why y'all keep bringing up Tariq?
He got to you, didn't he?
What did you tell him, Candace?
Nothing.
He just wants to talk.
Follow me, I want to show you something.
What?
The door.
Cookie!
Oh, no, Cookie, look!
No, you gotta go.
All he said was that he wanted to talk.
I don't care what he said.
: I'm serious.
What is he waiting for...
(chuckles)
I was right.
Y'all was buttering me up for his ass.
He only wants Lucious.
He's not after you, or-or Carol, or anybody else.
I know Lucious married Anika just to keep her from testifying.
I can prove that the marriage is fake, I could subpoena her.
All right, look, Cookie, come on.
After everything Lucious did to you, really?
To us? Come on, why would we protect him?
: He's like a mangy mutt with a bone, Lucious. We got to get to Anika before he does.
Mr. Lyon, your wife's been discharged. You just missed her.
The nurses gave her the cutest teddy bear.
What?!
Wait, wait. I called here and said specifically to hold her.
I was coming to get her.
I'm sorry, there must have been a mix-up. Nobody gave me that message.
Damn.
She's headed back to her place. We got to stop her.
If she gets back to her apartment, it's a wrap.
The Feds will have proof that your marriage is fake.
Lucious, she needs to look like she's moving in with you in that mansion.
That's all right, I'm gonna call the head of my security, have him intercept her.
It's all your fault. You know that, right?
Hey. Where you at?
Okay, what am I supposed to do here?
I don't have any of my things.
We'll take care of it. Don't worry.
Welcome back, Ms. Anika.
Thank you, Juanita.
Good to see you.
May I?
Yes, you may.
This is Bella.
Oh. Bella. ‭(chuckles)

Oh.
Well, apparently, so do I.
So do we.

You about as trustworthy as a snake in a hamster cage.
I got my eye on you, sista.
And don't touch any of this food.

Juanita, take me to the nursery, please.

Compliments of Mr. Lyon.
No, thank you.
Yo, scrapple and eggs.

Thought you could use a little taste of home.
(chuckles) I haven't had scrapple in years.
Well, you'd be surprised at things I can make happen.
Like getting to Anika before I did and moving her in? (chuckles)
That ain't gonna stop me, brother.

Well, I know Lucious didn't approve it, so, what, you just gonna spring it on him?
I'm gonna ask for forgiveness, not permission, Ma.
Jamal, why?
Ma, because Freda's entire trial is stalled.
Her lawyers don't care about her, and the whole world hates her for what she did to me.
But, honestly, my family is to blame.
You want to pick a fight with your daddy?
It's on you. Just better be damn ready for it.

Come on, give me the baby. Come here, come here.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
What are you doing?
You don't know how to hold a baby?
Man, you got her neck all collapsed on her. Let go.
There you go.
There's Daddy, baby. You've been missing your daddy. (laughs) Come on.
Yes. Mmm.
Can't have all these strangers touching you.
There you go.
Yeah.
Why y'all so quiet?
We're all here so that we can welcome Tariq to his family.
Speaking of family, how'd you get yours to participate in this sham?
Ain't no sham.
What you see is what you get with us.
You know, in the olden days, a marriage wasn't real unless it was consummated.
What, you want to come and examine our bed sheets? (laughs)
(clears throat)
Do some DNA on 'em?
Or would you prefer to have me and my wife just get butt naked on the table and get busy?
You'd do it, wouldn't you? To avoid a warrant.
(silverware clinks on plate)
No need to be gauche, gentlemen.
Trust us, Tariq.
This marriage...
It's very real.
(Tariq laughs)
: Tariq... he's the only one from the family that came to see me at the home until Andre.
Is that right?
You remember me, Andre?
From when you was a shorty?
Yeah, I remember you.
Your pappy raised you to be the perfect little henchman.
Now you're a henchman with an Ivy League education.
(chuckles) What a waste of a good mind.
(laughs) What's the matter with you, young bull?
Huh? Yeah.
You talking to me?
He kicked you in your nuts over and over again.
Messed with your love life, took over your wedding.
He even stole your baby.
Here you are, sitting at his table.
My turn now?
Mm-hmm.
Let me help you out real quick.
‭Mm.
I was six years old when my father threw me in the trash.
At 18, he made me marry a girl I barely even knew, 'cause he was ashamed of my sexuality.
And then, uh, most recently, he... tried to take me down over some petty-ass ASA.
But that's my father.
And if he can't take down his own family, what makes you think that you and your little bitch badge can?
(chuckles)
: Be nice.
But Jamal is right.
Your family is real strong.
We've been thinking about you.
Mm.
All of us, a whole lot.
Thinking about you in that studio apartment, eating baked beans and Vienna sausages right out of a can... on rented furniture, when... you could be living like this.
'Cause we're family. You're my brother.
And as you can tell, I'm very generous to my family.
Are you bribing a federal agent?
You should go home... You're losing.
Oh, am I, Cookie?
Mm-hmm.
It seems to me you're the biggest loser here.
All right, uh-uh.
Really?
You're sitting at the table that should've been yours but never will be.
17 years? And you keep playing second fiddle to this... mulato bitch.
(chuckles) You gonna keep on protecting him while he treats you like second-rate trash?
I won't spend...
(family clamoring)
Who you talkin' to!
Jamal!
‭(others shouting)
Who you talking to, huh?!
Everybody, calm down!
Sit down, Jamal.
(Tariq chuckles)
: He's not worth it.
He just real thirsty, that's all.
: Get a bitch some water, then.
: I can handle this jerk.
Yes, I did make a sacrifice for my family.
That's what you do for family.
But I see you know nothing about that. And you might bend your feelings a little bit.
You didn't have much of a family, and neither did Lucious, but together we built this one.
And we're strong.
And we don't have time to entertain you and your little shenanigans anymore.
We have a show to do tomorrow.
Okay? (sniffs, clears throat)
Somebody pass me the salt, please?
Thank you.
You want a to-go plate?
: You are literally surrounded by Empire music.
Everywhere you turn, there's an artist whose music is going to stream exclusively on Empire XStream.
We are taking over the world!

Now, I want to welcome to the stage, performing for the first time since his brief taste of the Angel of Death, my son and progeny, the incomparable Jamal...
Lyon...!
(loud cheering)
(cheering continues)
(whistling, whooping)
: Listen, um, we live in a really, really heavy time right now.
