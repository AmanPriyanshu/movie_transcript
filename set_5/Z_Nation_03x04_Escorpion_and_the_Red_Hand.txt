Previously on Z Nation.
Where are you going?
To start a new world.
You're with me now.
I'll never be with you.
I've been a one man Apocalypse all my life.
[explosion]
Yo soy Escorpion. I don't die. I kill.
No one disrespects me and lives.
I saw Escorpion's tattoo.
We're exactly the same.
In that one second I saw every horrible thing I ever did.
And I wanted to die right there and then.
But I had to survive and make up for all the things that I did.
Maybe this is how I do it.
Thank you.
De nada.
I'm not that man anymore. That man is dead.
[creak]
[slice]
[hiss]
[thump, thump, thump]
[hiss]
[fire crackling]
[snarling]
[snarling]
Looks like something I would do.
Damn. It's been a long time since something shocked me.
So what do you make of this?
Territory thing?
Someone's trying to send a message.
Someone who doesn't want to be misunderstood.
Heads up!
[muffled growling]
[growling]
[growling]
[punching]
[electric zapping]
[growling]

[gunshot]
[smack]
[slicing]
[gunshot]
Yeah, I could have told you this was a sketchy neighborhood.
Could tell by all that damn graffiti on the wall.
[gunshot]
No, no, no, no, no, no. Uh uh. Uh uh.
Hands when we can see them!
Easy now.
Admiring your work?
Come back to finish us off?
You got it wrong, brother.
You and every one of the Red Hand are gonna die for what you did here.
Hey, we had nothing to do with these killings.
We were cutting down our friends to bury them.
Yeah, well you dropped them right on us man!
Let me see your hands!
The backs of your hands! Now!
Look! We don't want any trouble!
Their hands are clean.
What are you doing here then? What do you want?
Look, we were just passing through here when we came upon this.
What happened?
Red Hand.
Two days ago everyone was alive.
Now look at this.
We're gonna bury our friends, and then we're going hunting.
We're gonna kill every last one of the Red Hand.
And their scumbag leader, Escorpion.
Been here a couple of months. Good water supply.
Pretty good weather. Not a lot of Zs.
Not a lot of trouble.
Then Red Hand came through like a storm. Killed everyone.
Tortured them all first.
The Red Hand?
Vigilantes.
A gang of psychopaths, really. I'd heard about them.
But I thought it was an Apocalypse story.
Like Ant People or The Murphy.
But they're real, all right.
And after they've had their fun, they paint their victims with the red hand.
They left him alive as a warning.
Might as well be dead.
[squeak]
They're all cult crazy sons of bitches, now.
Taking orders from Escorpion.
How do you know it's Escorpion?
Tell him about the tattoo.
He's got some kid on his arm.
We're going to get justice.
Then we're gonna watch him turn.
[splorch]
Red Hand!
[gunshot]
Take cover!
[gunshots]
[glass breaking]
[fire roaring]
[growling]
No matter where you run, they will always find you.
Looks like we have some Murphy-seeking squatters out in the cheap seats.
Just finished repairing that section of fence.
Would you like to show me where to put the compost pile?
Yes.
I'll check out the zombie moat while I'm at it.
Well, the zombie moat seems to be working nicely.
Thank you. I followed your specs exactly.
It's a little thin on the Z side.
Get some more zombies in here?
I'm on it.
Who built this thing? Hunchbacks?
Fix that.
I will.
The Murphy.
No, no, no. Let him come.
Mr. Murphy, come, please. We need your help.
I think she's dying.
Please, save her.
Bite her like you did the others.
I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm too weak.
They've been taking my blood to make the vaccine. I'm sorry.
I can't. I can't bite all of you. I'm sorry.
But a cure is coming!
The Apocalypse as my witness, we are developing a cure.
Trust me.
I don't know, I'm just dragging, you know.
I don't have any, you know, pep.
Maybe I have low T.
You need to keep up your calorie intake.
I'm going to need a lot of blood.
Define a lot.
Sometimes I feel myself slipping away.
Like I'm not there anymore.
Like I'm becoming one of them.
[gasping]
We need to stop this process somehow.
This is a booster shot.
Original vaccine.
Oh no. No, no, no, no. Doc. I've had that stuff, remember?
I am not in the mood to have my head explode today.
Your head is not going to explode.
This is a booster with a micro-dose of the test vaccine you were given.
It should make you feel better.
You mean more human?
I mean less dead.
Can you cure me?
I'm working on it.
Now that I have your blood, I can mix your Z virus antibodies with the original vaccine.
When we inject the vaccine with your antibodies into humans, it creates a zombie/human blend.
A blend that I control?
Correct. In the meantime, these boosters with the original vaccine arrests the effects of your deterioration.
Without periodic boosters, you'll eventually end up like Patient Zero back in Colorado.
Some of the refugees won't take no for an answer.
I just saw two of them inside the fence.
The natives are getting restless.
We need that vaccine now.
It should be ready within 48 hours.
And you're making sufficient quantities?
As you instructed. 10,000 doses.
But I need to do more testing before we use it on humans.
I don't know if it's safe yet.
Blah, blah, blah.
The Apocalypse is one giant human trial.
The future is here. My people need that vaccine now.
[gurgling]
Wait.
Doc and Addy?
They went the other way.
[squeak]
[squeaking]
So not funny.
[muffled thumping]
[muffled screaming]
[muffled thumping continues]
She alive?
Try not to move.
The Red Hand.
Who are you with?
You Red Hand?
Are you with Escorpion?
Estás con Escorpion?
You are surrounded by a hundred Red Hand.
And they will feed your heart to Escorpion.
Easy, easy.
Is she hit?
I don't know.
No, it's my tooth.
I'll be okay.
[fart]
Choose your weapon. Whoopee cushion.
Exploding pen.
Chattering teeth.
Rubber chicken.
Hey, Addy.
Looks pretty bad.
That tooth is most definitely infected.
And spreading.
It will kill her.
You're gonna have to let us pull the tooth, sweetie.
Guys, start losing teeth and it's over.
Uh uh. Not gonna happen.
Hey. How are you doing?
Can you sit up?
Come on.
What happened?
You stabbed me.
You were under Murphy's control. The bite on your neck.
What?
I gave you a dose of the original HZN1 vaccine.
It counters his bite and frees us from Murphy's control.
I've been taking it too.
I need your help.
Murphy wants to save humanity by turning them into human-zombie blends.
What are we gonna do?
We need to destroy the vaccine.
These injectors are our boosters.
Without them, we will slowly slip back under his control.
When do we take them next?
You'll know when.
Just don't wait too long.
And be careful.
We're immune to Murphy's control, but not to the zombies anymore.
And the Zs know it. Go get a vehicle.
I will meet you out front after I destroy the batch.
Where are we going?
I don't know. Away from Murphy.
[whispering] Okay.
He has to help us! We can't wait any longer!
You have to bite us! We've seen you save them! Save us!
I told you.
I can't bite everyone.
I'm sorry.
I've seen what your bites can do.
Look, have mercy on us, please.
I'm sorry. I can't.
Just a few more. Have mercy!
It would kill me. And then we all die.
Then her. Just her. Just bite her.
Everybody else can wait. Please! Just take her!
Shelly! Shelly! Shelly, no! Shelly!
Shelly, shelly. Shelly, shelly.
It's the Murphy. Shelly.
[snarling]
Wait, wait, wait.
[snarling continues]
Shelly.
[snarling continues]
She can be part of the moat guard if you like.
Sorry for your loss.
[whispering] Shelly.
Shelly!
I need that vaccine now!
[crying] Shelly.
[glass breaking]
[thump]
[thump]
[thump]
[glass breaking]
These brick walls ain't gonna keep them out forever.
What's all this Escorpion talk?
I don't know.
I think somebody's impersonating me.
Or someone's taking advantage of your brand.
If the Red Hand are ex-Zeros, that would be bad.
These people find out you are Escorpion, that would be worse.
No matter how far I go, my past will always haunt me.
These are my ghosts.
What happened here?
Justice.
Justice for who?
What happened?
Hey, what's going on here?
Look at her hand.
She's one of them.
She's been gut shot.
Good. Let me help her along then.
Hold on. She may have information.
Ask your questions.
Then she gets what she gave.
No mercy.
Where's Escorpion?
No!
No!
Hey!
What really happened here?
What? What'd she tell you?
I wanna hear it from you.
They tortured and killed our families.
What more do you need to know?
Why they target you?
How should I know? They're crazy!
Everyone's crazy! Why are they crazy for you?
Those bodies hung like that?
That's somebody sending a message.
It's a warning.
Why they spray paint "thieves?"
How should I know?
[muffled explosion]
You're putting us in danger. Why are they after you?
Answer her!
They said we stole it, but that's our food. We found it.
We were starving.
We were on our last legs.
And someone had stored emergency rations here.
Wasn't much, but it saved us.
Shut the hell up!
They killed for that food.
Innocent people.
Escorpion is the protector of the innocent.
That was our food!
We did what we had to do.
You'd kill me right now if it suited your purposes.
And I'd do that same.
Ah.
I gotta make my way. Same as you.
It's the way it's always been. It's nature.
Addy. I got some crushed up Oxy here for you.
Not exactly the party I had in mind.
Get it back there. Get it back there.
You okay to fight?
Nevermind.
Oh sh1t.
Oh sh1t.
Go, go, go!
[gunshots]
[glass breaking]
Come on, Addy! Got to go!
[glass breaking]
Where are we going?
[glass breaking]
That way!
[glass breaking]
[moaning and gasping]
Fever. Erratic heart rate. She might be going into septic shock...
[moaning and gasping]
Who is Escorpion?
¿No sabes?
What does he look like?
El se parece a ti.
You.
No.
No soy Escorpion.
Back off.
What'd you say to her? What did she say?
She said "you."
She says she doesn't know.
[growling]
¿Verdad Escorpion?
Yo trabajo para usted.
No. No soy.
What about Escorpion?
Move.
[crash]
[growling]
[growling]
What? What?
[smack]
[thwap]
What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?
[splorch]
[smack]
[slice]
She turned. I had to mercy her.
[groaning]
Easy.
[groaning]
Shhh, shhh. Shhh, shhh. [groaning]
[groaning]
[moaning]
Restrain her!
I'm trying! Quit moving around so much!
[struggling]
Take it easy, Addy.
We're just trying to help!
[gasping]
[screaming]
[glass breaking]
[fire roaring]
What did she tell you?
You'd know if you hadn't run.
Why did she call you Escorpion?
She said she didn't know where Escorpion was.
Well she's dead now, isn't she?
What you saying?
I'm saying it's pretty convenient.
I'm sure she doesn't think so.
[muffled drumming ceases]
Now what?
Is that what I think it is?
Yeah.
A bomb-zombie?
Gotta admit, whoever they are they got style.
Really?
Hang on.
Move.
[growling]
[explosion]
It worked.
[clank, clank, clank, clank]
Oh sh1t.
Get back!
[explosion]
Wake up, Lieutenant.
Wake up.
Get up, Lieutenant.
Get up!
Get up.
Wake up, Lieutenant.
Get up, Lieutenant.
Please get up.
I need you. You hear me?
Now get up!
Get up!

I'm all loaded up.
Let's get your stuff, and let's go.
Dr. Merch?
Dr. Merch?
I'm sorry. You looking for these?
Sorry, but these are for me.
But you do look like you could use a little Murphy booster to keep you in line.
Don't worry. I don't have to bite you again.
You can be the first to try the new blend vaccine.
Now, now. We don't take what isn't ours.
I'm trying to help you, God dammit.
What's the matter?
You're not one of those anti-vaxxers, are you?
[glass breaking]
[crash]
[moaning]
Catch him! He's got my medicine!
After him!
Everybody after him!

I don't blame you, son.
But Murphy cares about you.
And he only wants to help.
It's time to come home.
You are Escorpion.
You did this!
You got it wrong, man.
Tell your men to back off!
They're not my men. I have nothing to do with the Red Hand You're lying!
The tattoo.
I'm not that man anymore.
So you are Escorpion?
I was Escorpion.
And for that I deserve to die.
But not for this.
And not by you.
Die you son of a bitch!
You don't have to do this, bro.
Let him go!
You don't have to...
[groaning]
[gurgling]

Help us! Help us!

So nice to see you recommitted, doctor.
We really are doing God's work here.
Welcome to the future.
Why are you so glum?
We are saving the world.
You're part of the cure.
Welcome to the future.
[vomiting]
That's not the last time that's gonna happen.
Can someone bring a bucket or something?
Is this about 10K?
Is that it? Cuz that is on you. It was not my fault.
I know you're still fighting this. I can feel it.
But you'll come around.
It's inevitable.
Welcome to the future.
There's no other conclusion you can come to other than, I am right.
These 10,000 doses, they're just the start.
After that, we'll make another 10,000.
And after that, another 10,000.
And after that, ten million.
Think of it!
A life without fear.
A life without desperation.
We'll start over, and we will do it right this time.
We'll do it my way.
[growling]
[growling]
Well that was fun.
I'm sorry I...
You were in a lot of pain.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Don't ever touch me again.
[spitting]
The drums.
That good or bad?
I dunno.
I don't see anything moving.
Let's get out of here.
I'm never gonna get away from who I am.
None of us gets away. It's the Apocalypse.
My ghosts will always be with me.
As long as I'm with you, the team will always be in danger.
I don't give a damn about your ghosts.
With Vasquez gone, I need your firepower.
These men are dead because of me.
It's gonna happen to you too.
Everyone close to me dies.
Everyone close to everyone dies.
I don't need a saint.
Or a lover.
I need a killer.
The only redemption any of us has is to survive.
To live another day.
Look. You can't change who you are, Hector.
But you can change what you do.
Use who you are to give us all another chance.
Looks like we missed a hell of a party.
The Red Hand moved on. But I don't believe it.
Glad to see you're all right. We heard the explosions.
We're alive.
How are you doing?
Better. Thanks to her.
So they can't find anything but spray paint in the Apocalypse?
I don't think we've seen the last of the Red Hand.
So let's get moving.
[hollow whispering] Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Just keep walking.
Merch! Merch! Merch!
[snarling]
[snarling]
[whimpering]
No! No! Stop! Stop! Don't do it! Stop!
[screaming]
[yelling]
[growling and munching]
