Did he take something?
I don't know. Probably. It's a party.
Probably O.D.'d. Give him a shot of Narcan.

Yeah, but not warfarin.

Yeah. I've been hounding the folks at Pressler Pharmaceuticals for months to get them to choose us for one of their studies.
They've got this high-tech transcatheter valve... gets patients in and out of the hospital in, like, half the time.
So what's the holdup?
The holdup is they're only giving sample valves to four hospitals nationwide, which means that we all have to bend over and grab our ankles just to get a meeting.
Sounds like a hell of a meeting.
Hi. Uh, you must be Dr. Clemmens.
Jessica Sanders, Pressler rep.

Hey.
[Siren wailing in distance]
What are you still doing here?
I-I didn't wanna be alone.
That's why I brought T.C. food. [Sighs]
That's why I helped Topher with that OD.
Yeah, I get it.
Anything to avoid the middle of the night struggle.
Staring at the ceiling, waiting for the sun to come up.
Pretty much.
I know you two aren't close.
I know about the whole Jordan thing, but he's been amazing to me.
Taking care of me, helping me. He's been my rock.
That's really great.
Yeah, but it's a lot of pressure, too, you know?
I feel like I can't be totally honest with him, like... he'll be nervous or get worried or...
[Voice breaks] I just... I don't wanna disappoint him.
You know, it's gotta be about you.
That's what scares me.
I keep thinking about that... man, that boy who ODed tonight.
I just keep thinking that could've been me.
It's not.
You're here, alive, working your program, step by step.
I know.
But something that Shannon girl said...
Oh. Do 
 listen to her.
She's mouthy, that one.
[Laughs]
[Chuckles]
Yeah, that's for damn sure.
Still, I just... [Sighs]
What if I relapse?
What if I'm not strong enough?
Then you get back up and you start over.
Have you ever relapsed?
Yeah. It was last year.
I relapsed last year.
[Cellphone chimes]
[Sighs]
[Cellphone closes]
I gotta take this.
: Uh, it could be a reaction to the anesthesia?
No, she must've had a pleural tear.
And the positive pressure from the vent has caused subcutaneous emphysema.
What does that mean? Is she okay?
Air from her lungs is leaking into her soft tissue.
[Alarm beeping]
Uh, guys...
She's blowing up.
[Monitor beeping]
Her sats are dropping.
Constricting her lungs.
Do something! Help her!

BP's down to 63 systolic.
All right, we gotta go.
Stay with us, Alina.
[Monitor beeping]
[Monitor beeping]
Pressure's holding.
Okay, I need to make another incision.
All right.
[Gasps]
So, I, uh, I talked to that pharma rep.
And she's gonna try to get you in on that trial study.
I told you I didn't wanna do that.
Look, you are not gonna make it to Mexico without some help, all right?
You fainted, you have a fever.
You need this. Thank you.
Why can't you just take "no" for an answer?
I don't like to quit.
Why does that bother you so much?
Well, can't someone just care? I mean, come on.
Yeah, but there's always a deeper meaning to it.
What is this, a therapy session?
Who's treating who here?
I guess I didn't mention what my job was.
I'm a therapist.
Oh. Well, that makes sense.
Where have you been my whole life?
I'm here now.
So what do you think this not being able to quit is about?
Come on, let me feel like I'm helping somebody again.
You really wanna do this?
You talk to me...
I will try your study.
Feeling better now, huh?
Yeah. That was scary.
I bet.
The air will continue to drain, so you might feel a little swollen for a few more days.
And you'll be immobilized for a while with that pelvic fracture.
But she's gonna be okay, right?
: Physically, she'll heal okay.
[Gloves snapping]
Alina, we, uh, we need to talk to you about the medication you were taking.
What medication?
Ruprorin. The acne medication.
Yeah, it's got some pretty serious side effects, including suicidal thoughts.
It wasn't the pills.
I hadn't taken it yet.
What?
It's just been really hard for me this year with school and just been feeling alone.
Alina, why didn't you tell me you were feeling that way?
Didn't wanna bother anyone.
The second I stepped off the balcony, I changed my mind, but... it was too late.
Alina, I've been there.
[Voice breaks] You have?
Yeah.
When I got back from the war, I lost my brother, and I didn't see any reason.
But there was.
And I got help.
That was the best thing I ever did.
I'd like to go get someone to come talk with you.
Would that be okay?
Okay.
Are my parents coming?
Yeah, they got in the first flight to come see you.
Can I stay with her?
Yeah, of course.
We'll, uh, we'll check in later. Okay?

Oh, yeah, if Drew didn't break your elbow, you would've smoked her.
Hey, it's not broken.
Okay? Just sprained.
You are gonna have to wear this sling for a week.
What? I don't even get a cool cast for people to write on?
Sorry. And I'm really sorry about all this.
I know it's not the best way to end the night.
It's okay. I had fun.
And at least my mom will get to see the video of my first match.
Yeah, and she'll get to kill me when she comes home and sees you.
Yeah.
[Chuckles] Yeah.

Hi, Mom. No, I'm fine. No, it was all my fault.
I know. I tripped. I'm a klutz.
But wait until you see the match. I was awesome.
There have been times in my life... my father, uh... he's dead, by the way.
And in my personal relationships where I feel like I have quit.
I feel like I...
[Sighs] could've done more to help them.
Um, since I don't have what it takes in my personal life, I make damn sure not to quit in my professional one.
Whoa.
You are messed up. I'm sorry I asked.
I gotcha, didn't I?
Yeah, a little.
Which tells me that you believe that crap.
Which crap?
The crap about you quitting on people.
I mean, it's not as simple as it sounds, but you know you bust your ass with your patients.
So why won't you give yourself the same benefit of the doubt with your relationships?
I don't know.
Well, then that's what we should be talking about.
: So that's when you relapsed?
[Sighs] I settled the lawsuit, and I gave them everything I had.
I lost everything.
But I still couldn't stand the guilt.
And I tried to go see him, but they wouldn't let me.
Still won't let me.
And so then...
I had a drink.

But then you just... stopped yourself?
Barely.
But it never even should've gotten to that point.
There's always help available, but I ignored it.

Hey, uh, Shannon. Um, I'm glad I caught you.
There's something I-I need to say.
What's up?
Um, earlier, when you seemed nonchalant after we lost the patient...
Topher...
Just hear me out 'cause this is important.
I know we see some terrible things in this job.
And in order to survive, we do need to be able to compartmentalize certain things and not get too attached.
It's not that.
Look, that kid who overdosed and then seeing that girl jump because I thought she was drunk, it pushed my buttons.
How... how so?
Where I grew up, drugs and alcohol are everywhere.
So when I see some rich, white college kid who has it all and just throws it away?
I worked really hard to get to where I am today and I almost didn't make it.
I would've given anything to have the opportunities he had.
So I'm sorry, but I don't have a lot of sympathy.
Well, there's nothing wrong with being proud of what you've overcome, but you do have to find a way to make an emotional connection with your patients, No matter what biases you might have.
We all bring our own baggage to every case, especially when you first start.
But you have to find a way to put that aside if you ever hope to grow as a doctor.
Okay. I'll work on it.
Okay.
I will.

I'm sorry. I am... I'm a Lucha Libre newbie.
Oh. Well, the people hated me, and I didn't like it.
So, uh, I laid low for a minute, reinvented myself.
Hmm. Sounds like something I just did, you know?
Went on a sabbatical, disappeared for a while.
[Coughing]
Hey. Hey, hey.
You're okay. You're okay.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
All right, let's do an AP lap of his chest, and page RT for a breathing treatment.
[Continues coughing]
All right. Breathe.
Oh, man.
Hey, Heather, it's the last bag of ice.
Thank you.
Every bed is taken with a heat stroke patient.
Can't get a repair man here for another two hours.
But never mind that. [Laughs]
I'm Dr. Zia.
Hi. Normally, I like to stand up when I meet new people, but there's a needle in my back.
I-I see that.
[Sighs] Fever and a rash, headache, vomiting.
Blood work is clean.
Meningitis.
Yeah, sounds like it.
I don't know if it's bacterial or viral.
Let's hope it's the latter.
Yeah, we should isolate her and start her on antibiotics just in case.
Isolate me?
No, it's just a precaution.
You know, Georgia here is training to do a Tough Mudder.
Dr. Zia's trying to get in shape.
Perhaps you could give him some pointers.
Oh, thanks. I-I got it covered.
Really?
Yeah, Doc, you look a little scrawny to me.
[Laughs] Listen, two months ago, I couldn't run for seven minutes.
Now I can run for 7 miles.
That's pretty good.
But let me guess you hit a plateau.
Come on, give me a break.
I just quit smoking, my mother lives with me.
Oh. You definitely get a pass.
[Laughter]
Uh, can you send that up to micro?
I'm gonna get the isolation room started.
Okay, thanks.
Georgia, back in a couple minutes.
Hey, hey.
You okay?
Yeah, I, uh, I just brought a girl in from the halfway house.
Drying out from, uh, heroin and a heat wave don't mix.
You want me to take a look at her?
No, she's just dehydrated. Kenny's giving her fluids.
I'm gonna grab something from the cafeteria and head out.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Pfft. What... [Chuckles]
What... what are you doing here?
I have an ENT who's using a new laser.
I had to give him a refresher course.
My job is getting old.
I need to find something more challenging.
Mmm, any chance you can sneak away?
I just need you for 5, 10 minutes tops.
[Sighs] Yeah, I wish, but... I got a patient.
Oh.
Well, if you change your mind... there is nothing between me and these pants.
Nothing.
I don't need that.
Doc, my cousin's had this cough for the last few weeks.
He went on antibiotics twice and they didn't work.
Yeah, I heard him coughing at the match.
It could be bronchitis or asthma.
Okay. [Sighs]
Victor, your x-ray patterns are suggestive of TB.
We're gonna have to get you and anyone else who was on that tour tested.
That means you, too, Matador.
Are you serious?
I'm always serious. Shouldn't we isolate both of them?
Yeah, but where?
Okay, T.C. already has a patient in isolation.
And if this is a bunch of people with tuberculosis, we are screwed.
: How does a ring girl get messed up instead of a wrestler?
Removing a piece of lamina.
Oh, damn.
Clot and bone fragments are blocking our access.
: Yeah.
All right, let's get it all cleaned out.
It's gonna take too long to clear all this out.
Any delay with this heat, too risky.
Chance of infection's too high.
We need another way in.
We can go through the mouth.
We can bypass the debris and cut the OR time in half.
Through the mouth?
Have you done that before?
I assisted in the exact same procedure on a corporal in Bagram.
He had a piece of shrapnel lodged on his second vertebrae.
And it worked?
Yeah.
I'm not gonna lie. It's pretty tricky.
But if we don't, this girl will never walk again.
Well, you Army docs do stuff on the battlefield every day that we've never tried around here.
Let's do it.

You okay?
Just remind me never to promise a patient anything ever again.
♪ ♪
Okay, I need you to check every person in that waiting room who was on that tour who has TB symptoms.
Okay.
Hey.
So I saw something you should know about, but you'll be happy you didn't see it.
T.C.'s hooking up with that new drug rep, the one with the $600 stilettos and Ducati.
Uh... that's great.
I'm... I'm happy for him.
Hmm.
You know, you shouldn't gossip so much.
You never know if it's gonna come back and bite you in the ass.
I wasn't gossiping.
This is all about sisterhood. I thought you'd wanna know.
Well, thank you.
But, uh, let's keep it between the two of us, okay?
And you have a patient.
: 82-year-old female with heat exhaustion and syncope... Whoa. What's going on in here?
Dante's nine circles of hell.
Should you guys still be taking patients?
Topher's call.
Hey.
Hey.
I thought you had the night off.
I did until the audience decided to join in on the fighting and a crazy fan tried to kick me in the head.
Well, I'm glad you weren't kicked in the head.
Yeah, me, too.
Here, you might need this.
Oh. That's... sweet.
[Chuckles]
Okay, okay. All right, I...
I'm at work. Gotta go.
Think T.C. knows about those two?
I-I didn't know, so I-I doubt he has any idea.
Not sure how he's gonna take it.
Oh, he's a big boy. He can handle it.
Yeah.
Well, I didn't see nothing.
[Mutters]
[Laughs]
I didn't... oh! I didn't see... No, man. [Laughs]
Are you okay?
Yeah, I just got a cramp in my... my glute.
[Clears throat] Ah! Whoa.
What, uh... so speaking of muscles, how's... how's your bike training been going?
I did 40 minutes on the stationary bike yesterday.
Hey, tomorrow, I'm taking you outside on the terrain.
All right? Stay hydrated.
[Under breath] Thank you.
Oh, man.
Hey, uh, Topher.
Hello, Sam.
Should we be rerouting patients to another hospital?
Uh... I called St. Luke's. They're just as slammed.
Could you and a couple of your guys bring as much ice as you can get your hands on?
If you have any extra fans at the station, bring those, too.
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
I, uh, I have your patie... I-I have your labs.
You're a lab tech now?
No wonder you couldn't hack the ER.
I was... I was coming to check on...
You know what? Do you want your patient's TB results or not?
'Cause... they're negative.
So I'm good, right?
We'll still send this off in case it was a false negative.
Anything else?
Maybe you'd like to pull up a chair, play some "Farm Heroes" on your phone?
What...
What's happening?
Okay.
Help him!
Jordan!
[Victor continues coughing]
Okay, I need an ultrasound.
Okay, all right.
His liver's bleeding.
Let's get him to the OR.
All right.
Looks like you got your first patient.
Cousin! I'm praying for you, man.
He has a cyst on his liver near the bleeding.
It could complicate surgery.
Paul, take care of this guy, okay? He's special.
I heard that.
You're in good hands, Victor.
I already was.
Scott's in OR 2. Grab him.
OR 2.

Okay, Scott, I got my finger on the anterior tubercle.
Grab it carefully with a Kocher.

Exactly.
Okay, once that's aligned, I'll place an odontoid screw.
Dr. Clemmens? You're needed in OR 1 immediately.
Don't worry, Scott. I got this.
If you need me, I'm 30 seconds away.
All right, Nurse. Hold traction.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Hi.
Oh, I brought in someone from the halfway house.
Kenny told me I'd find you up here.
Yeah. Um, I have your wallet.
Oh, you could've given this to me later.
I know. I just...
I'm being kind of silly.
I kind of wanted to see you again.
I'm really happy to see you. But I'm running into surgery.
So why don't you pick me up later and we'll go have breakfast?
Okay. Good?
Jordan. Hi.
Hi.
Scott and I just started dating.
I see that.
It's very new. We... we haven't told anybody yet.
So does that mean T.C. doesn't know?
I... I kind of wanted to wait and see where things were going first.
But... I guess it looks like it's going someplace good.
Okay.
Hey. Brought you another fan.
Oh, point it right at my face.
Georgia, your cerebrospinal fluid was positive.
I have meningitis?
Yeah.
We're not sure what kind yet 'cause the cultures haven't come back.
So hopefully, it's just viral and it'll go... go away.
You okay?
[Grunts] My chest hurts.
I can't breathe. [Gasps]
What's going on?
Toph, she's having a heart attack.
I'll page cardiology.
All right.
That's it. That's it. Okay.
[Monitor beeping steadily]
How's Victor's surgery going?
We're almost done here.
Repaired the lacerated liver and removed the cyst.
: Blood pressure's down to 72 systolic.
: He must be bleeding somewhere.
The field looks dry.
Did you check behind the liver?
Yes. I did already.
He's down to 58, guys.
We're gonna lose him.

Cardiology has somebody in the Cath Lab, says she'll be next.
Just started heparin and a nitro drip.
We're missing something.
Meningitis doesn't cause heart attacks.
Unless the same virus is attacking the heart.
But her viral panel was normal.
Topher. Look at the skin on her hands.
What the hell? It's peeling off.
Yeah.
Conjunctivitis, skin shedding, strawberry tongue.
This is Kawasaki disease.
The diffuse inflammatory reaction could explain the multiple symptoms.
Yeah, and it causes aneurysms of the coronary arteries, which would explain the heart attack.
Okay, get cardiology. She's gotta go to the OR for bypass surgery.
: I'll take her right away.
[Monitor beeping rapidly]
Crit is stable.
So he's not bleeding.
Levophed is maxed out. It's not working.
Maybe he's septic?
No, white count and temperature are normal.
Could be an adrenal issue. Let's put the films back up.
Okay, hold on a second. Um...
All right, he was traveling in Mexico for about a month.
And his cousin said he was eating pork like it was going out of style.
Parasites?
Hand me the specimen container with the cyst.
Look at those suckers. Unbelievable.
He's in anaphylactic shock from the parasites pouring into his abdomen.

He's crashing.

Hand me an epi now.
Suction.
Meds are in.
Come on, come on, come on.

BP's up.
That was close.
Almost too close.
All right. Nice work, Paul. You good to close?
Yep.

[Sighs] Hey. What's going on?
I could be hallucinating from the heat, but I think Drew's doing a spinal surgery through a patient's mouth.
Wow.
Where'd he learn how to do that?
It's the Major that he worked with during his last deployment.
She made a real impression.
Guess our little boy's growing up.
I guess so.
How's Georgia? So far so good.
Uh, surgeon thinks we got it in time.
Heat wave ended up saving her life.

I didn't want you to hear it from one of the nurses.
Seems like a nice guy.

You really moved on?
Mm-hmm.
Hardest thing I've ever done.
Hydatid cyst. It's crazy.
Haven't seen one of those since residency.
Yeah, well, thanks for pulling out all the stops.
Hey, whatever you wanna say, just say it, Jordan.

Oh, do you?
Yes.
I know that she is sober and she is trying to be a better person, but I have seen her go down that path a hundred times before and it never works out.
So you're an expert on all things Annie?

Okay? She stole from T.C.
Yeah, and she came back, and she's been trying to make it up to him.
Do you have any idea how hard that was for her to do?

Well, obviously, someone is feeling better.
Hmm.
Okay, Victor, you are going to have to take an anti-parasitic pill for the next few weeks, but you should make a full recovery.
So the parasite's giving him that cough?
Yeah, he had an autoimmune response to the parasite which caused areas of swelling in his lungs.
And, Victor, that parasite in there is why you couldn't gain weight.
Awesome. So I could put on some muscle now?
Yes. Yes, you can.
[Lowered voice] Hey. Hey, Doc.
So what are the chances that Victor's ever gonna bulk up like me?
Slim.

You know what I mean?
Hmm.
I have an idea.
So my body's attacking itself?
Yes, but this medication will stop the process.

We, uh, we rarely see this disease in adults.
