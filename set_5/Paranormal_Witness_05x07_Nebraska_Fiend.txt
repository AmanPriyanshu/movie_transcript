(SOLEMN FLUTE SOLO)
This actually happened. This wasn't a dream, Mom.
She was scary.
Mama. Mama.
It sounded like a little girl's voice.
(CLATTERING)
I've never been so scared.
(FLAMES WHOOSHING)
Mom! (SHRIEKS)
(GASPS)
It's your job to protect those kids.
I didn't.
(GASPING)
Mom, Mom, my back! Oh!
What's doing this? Who's doing this to you?
Did you mean to scare the little girl?
(STATIC CRACKLING)
"Yes, she better run."
It's been in my house...
With my kids.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Moving-in day was pretty exciting.
It was just kind of a humongous shock to me, you know, being 12 or 13 years old, because 
It was so much bigger than our old house.
Rhiannon is the best big sister that I could ever ask for.
She's a really nice person, loving.
It's your own room.
Wow.
Rylee does have a speech impediment.
She's had it since she was a little girl.
You like it, Rylee?
You bet.
And everybody asks her where she's from and where her accent is from.
(MURMURS)
Oh, sure.
Oh...
I was just tired of having to share a room with my sister, and I was so happy to get my own room.
We always did want to have a son, and the girls wanted to have a brother in the family.
So, because of that, we decided to look into the adoption process.
Big enough for your new brother?
He'll love it.
When's he coming?
I want him to see it now.
We got to get everything ready first.
Population about 48 people, nice and small, quiet.
When we moved in, it was the perfect beginning to the next chapter of our lives.
Hey, is that ours too?
Sure is.
Cool. Let's check it out.
 and it was decrepit, and it had to be over 100 years old.
(INSECTS BUZZING)
(DOG PANTING)
(DOG WHINING)
What is it? What's wrong?
(DOG WHINING)
(DOOR CREAKS)
(WINGS FLUTTERING)
(FLIES BUZZING)
It was disgusting.
(FLIES BUZZING)
(FLIES BUZZING)
It smelled like rotten wood or eggs.
It was really bad.
(WOOD CREAKING)
(FLIES BUZZING)
It was weird and it was freaky...
 the animal heads were watching you.
Let's get out of here.
No. I want to check it out.
It was just kind of scary. I left.
I wanted to leave, but I felt like I was a piece of metal being pulled by a magnet.
I needed to be there.
Rylee?
(CHILD GIGGLING)
And no one was there, and I thought, "God, that was weird.
I swear I just... I just heard someone."
(METAL CLANKS)
I was, you know, poking around things.
I remember thinking, "What am I even doing in here?"
I didn't know what I was looking for.
(CLATTERING)
A little girl's voice saying...
"Mama. Mama."
Is Rylee with you?
No, honey. She's back in the house.
Maybe I'm tired. I just need to sleep."
And I just ignored it.
Wow.
Would you look at this?
It's beautiful.
Once we had my grandmother's dinnerware in there, it just seemed to fit perfectly in the house.
(DOG BARKING AND WHINING)
And my back is turned to everybody.
Edith, dear, I'm home.
How was your day today, Archie?
Girls and I were in the living room, watching a TV show.
(KNIFE CHOPPING)
Mama. Mama.
I heard this voice right in my ear.
(DOG WHINES)
(GROWLING)
What do you want?
Hmm?
What are you talking about?
I think you're losing your hearing in your old age.
"You're losing your hearing in your old age, going crazy"... teasing her about stuff like that.
I just went back to cooking and let it go.
I let it drop.
(CREAKING)
(CLOCK TICKING)
(FEET PATTERING, DOG WHINES)
 thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump of little feet going out on the tile.
(GIGGLING AND FOOTSTEPS) (GROANS)
Somebody's still awake. Go see?
 outside of our bedroom door.
We heard some giggling, laughing.
(SIGHS)
 didn't see no kids or nothing.
I started hearing a noise.
I couldn't quite figure out what it was.
It sounded like it was a type of a lullaby being played on a flute or something like that.
I was like, "Oh, God, it's my alarm.
I'm gonna be late for school."
So I get up and I look at my clock, 
(CLOCK TICKING)
So I thought, "This is something.
This is weird."
Can you hear that?
What is that?
(DOG BARKING)
It was just really unnerving and unsettling to have this music there.
 that is making this music noise that I'm hearing.
So we... okay, maybe we're hearing things.
(LOUD KNOCKING, DOG BARKS)
(DOG BARKING)
(DOG GROWLING)
They were very distinct.
(KNOCKING)
It sounded like the banging was coming from the china hutch.
(DOG GROWLING)
(DOG BARKING)
Must be the pipes or something.
(DOG BARKING)
Come on, boy.
(DOG WHINES)
We just kind of let it go and forgot about it.
I thought it was all over.
(DOOR UNLATCHES)
(DOOR CREAKING)
Mom, is that you?
(INSECTS CHIRPING)
 the figure I'd seen was gone.
 It was probably just a shadow, you know? Nothing scary. Just a shadow. 
I left the lights on that night because it scared me so much I didn't want to sleep in the dark.
I didn't want to see another shadow.
Forecast: plenty of sunshine for today, with seasonal temperatures...
Morning.
Morning.
Clear skies tonight with a low near 70.
Increasing cloudiness tomorrow, sticky and humid, with a high...
Morning, sweetheart.
Yeah, I know.
 she didn't look like she was very well-rested.
What's up?
 because I didn't want to burden Mom and Dad with the stress of thinking their daughter's insane 
Nothing. I'm just tired.
(DOG WHINING)
(BARKING)
(FLUTE MUSIC)
I was asleep in bed when I was awoken by a strange noise.
Then I started listening, and it sounded like music.
(WIND BLOWING)
(BANGING AND RATTLING)
 the bed started shaking.
(WHIMPERING)
(BANGING AND RATTLING)
(GASPING)
And all I could do was just sit there in terror.
(SCREAMING) Mom!
Mom! Mom! (CRYING)
It felt like fists were hitting my bed and punching me.
Mom! (CRYING)
(DOOR UNLATCHES)
(GASPING)
Something's under the bed, shaking it.
Just frantic, screaming that something was under her bed, shaking her bed.
(SOBBING)
The bed wasn't moving.
There's nothing there, honey. It's okay.
It was solid.
It wasn't shifting around.
(SOBS)
It must have been a bad dream.
It wasn't a dream!
I was telling my mom that this actually happened.
"This wasn't a dream, Mom.
This actually happened."
But she didn't believe me.
(CRYING)
 and I didn't understand how to... help her feel safe.
(CRYING)
I don't want to sleep in here tonight.
And it makes me feel bad now knowing I didn't believe her at first.
(BIRDS COOING, WINGS FLUTTERING)
We were watching TV.
(WHISPERS) Go get some ice cream.
Rhiannon nominated me to go get the ice cream from the basement.
Really?
It's scary down there.
Are you chicken?
(DOOR CREAKS)
(LIGHT BULB BUZZING)
I heard a strange noise.
I couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from.
There was a woman standing next to the freezer.
(MARKER SCRATCHING)
Honey, is everything okay?
When I looked over her shoulder, I saw what she was drawing.
The face was angry.
It was so mad, and it had, like, black slashes for eyes, 
Why are you drawing that?
Because I saw it in the basement.
What?
I wanted to draw the woman so then other people could see what she looked like.
I went to go get some ice cream, and I saw her.
She was scary.
Come on downstairs, honey.
I had no idea what was going on.
I couldn't explain what had that ability to scare her so much.
Are you sure you're okay?
But then I got all protective, like, "No, don't do this to my little sister. 
(FLUTE MUSIC)
I was flipped onto my back.
It was as if my body had been taped down.
I was stuck.
(GASPING)
I couldn't move.
And I couldn't yell for help.
The girl was on the ceiling, staring down at me.
I've never been so scared.
 and she had the most... angriest expression I have ever seen.
Suddenly, she was gone.
(HEART POUNDING)
(GASPING)
I'm not going insane.
I'm being haunted.
(SNIFFLES)
We need to tell someone.
And just seconds after deciding that...
(SHRIEKING IN PAIN)
It felt like claws were being drug down my back.
(CRYING)
Mom. Mom, my back!
"What the hell's going on?" You know?
 and she was scared, and she said, "Something's on my back. Something's on my back."
(RHIANNON SCREAMS) Oh! Oh!
These three scratches appeared, going down her back.
It's okay, honey. It's okay.
I was so mad when I saw them, because I thought, "How dare something hurt my baby?"
Mom, it's been happening here.
Bad things.
There was this girl in my room, all bloody, and there was this voice in the barn, and I keep hearing this freaky music.
That's when she started to tell me about everything that she'd been experiencing.
What's going on?
Come here, honey. Come on.
It's hard to believe, you know, this is happening to my daughter.
I was upset because I couldn't do nothing to stop it.
And I didn't, because I couldn't.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
Danielle? Kris. We spoke on the phone.
Oh, thank you so much for coming.
That they were nervous and had been very frightened for a while.
Please.
 that they would solve the problem and that they would be able to take care of everything in the house.
Sometimes it's just misunderstanding environmental stimuli.
You know, old houses make noises.
There can be air in pipes that make banging noises.
(DEVICE BEEPS)
 before we assign anything, you know, as being paranormal.
 and accompanying changes in temperature also accompanies paranormal activity.
You see how it's just above zero there?
That's normal.
We couldn't find anything to explain what was going on.
(SOLEMN FLUTE MUSIC)
Tell me about the barn.
We don't go in there much.
Looks pretty old.
There was something just a little eerie about that place.
You could feel it before you even went inside it.
So we set up some stationary infrared cameras to try to capture anything that we might not be able to see with the naked eye that the camera could pick up.
(SNAPPING)
We also set up our digital audio recorders.
Okay, I'm going to need total silence.
Who are you?
 you can capture answers on the recording devices.
What is your name?
Are you trying to hurt Rhiannon?
Nothing. Silence.
Why do you go to Rhiannon's room?
(DEVICE BEEPING)
Paul?
What's going on? That can't be right.
It was 0.5, and then 10.
(DEVICES BEEPING)
Is there a power source coming to this building?
No.
No power lines outside?
Nothing.
There was no electricity going to the barn at all.
What's going on?
 like there was still electricity on.
What?
And that's just totally unheard of.
I've never seen that before.
(DEVICE BEEPING)
What's going on?
(DEVICE BEEPING RAPIDLY)
What is going on here?"
(BEEPING)
(GRUNTING AND GROANING)
(COUGHING) You all right?
(COUGHING, GAGGING)
Are you okay?
And dizzy.
That vertigo feeling.
I'm going to have to look at what we have and do some more research.
Okay?
Yeah.
 and make it stop.
(BIRD CAWING)
 we decided to check a little bit of the video from the barn.
Oh, my God.
(SIZZLING)
It made me worried for the family.
Okay, I'm going to need total silence.
So we start reviewing the audio evidence.
And then we got this male's voice that said...
"Stephen."
We also caught the name Richard.
I honestly thought that the name could well be a positive sign.
Why do you go to Rhiannon's room?
Do you realize that it scares her?
Did you mean to scare the little girl?
Very clearly, you could hear it, as plain as day.
"Yes. She better run."
I was excited as a researcher, as an investigator, because you don't get a whole sentence often.
 but it really scared me to death for her, because I thought it was very threatening.
Until we dug into the historical research and we realized that it was one person, one and the same:
Who's Stephen Richards?
I've never heard of this man.
You need to sit down.
Stephen Richards was the first serial killer ever hung in Nebraska.
He was often called the Bloody Butcher of Kearney County, and that's the name that we got in your home.
I couldn't believe what she was telling me about Stephen Richards.
I mean, this was something out of a nightmare or a movie.
His longest position that he was able to hold was at the Iowa State Insane Asylum.
Part of his job there was to bury some of the most unfortunate inmates.
(SHOVEL SCRAPING, MEN SCREAMING)
In 1878, he traveled to Nebraska and met and befriended Mrs. Harelson... and her three children, Daisy, Mabel, and Jesse.
Mrs. Harelson and her three children quickly fell under his spell.
They trusted him completely.
(LAUGHTER)
Richards was only interested in their land and their money.
(PAPERS RUSTLING)
Oh, my goodness.
This is his actual confession?
Ugh.
"I have killed, in all, nine persons.
"on the 26th day of April, 1879.
I killed the Harelson family and have kept people in ignorance... until now.
He's been in my house... (CRYING)
With my kids.
"I have been asked a good many times why I killed the Harelson family, and I have kept people in ignorance until now."
And approached the bed in which lay Daisy, asleep.
"At this, she moved a little and murmured something like..."
Mama.
Mama?
(CLATTERING)
And without waiting any longer, I...
"...Approached the bed of the mother, and getting a good aim at her head..."
"She, too, stirred but little and made no noise."
"Next I killed Mabel... Struck her on the forehead with the flat side of the axe... One blow... And killed her dead."
(BABY COOING)
(AXE CLANGING)
"I then stood still a moment, looking at the bed, 
Mom!
"And then she lay quite still."
Oh, God.
It almost makes me sick that this thing is in my house.
(SIGHS)
You will now be hung from the neck till you are dead.
He confessed to a multitude of crimes, never once showing any remorse.
I've never been happier in my life than at present.
On the morning of April 26th, he was hung for his dreadful crimes.
(ROPE STRAINING)
I was absolutely livid that this... complete monster was terrorizing my children.
(CRYING)
What do we do now?
How do I stop him?
We need to do a cleansing ceremony.
Because of the severity of the activity there, we felt like we should do a cleansing of the land.
I'll get everything ready, and we can do it tomorrow.
(MATCH FLARES)
(FLAMES WHOOSHING)
(FIRE CRACKLING)
(RATTLING)
(KNOCKING)
(DOG WHINING)
(RATTLING)
(KNOCKING)
(RATTLING)
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
(DOOR UNLATCHES)
(RATTLING)
(CREAKING)
I was like, "Oh, God, something is going to happen."
It felt like these two humongous hands just went... whoosh.
(GAGGING)
But it was, like, right here.
I then noticed some flashing lights underneath the window.
It's like, "Oh, crap.
Get the kids up. Get 'em ready."
Danielle, call 911!
We need to get them out of the house, 'cause we don't want to take any chances.
Get the kids! Get 'em ready! Come on!
His tone of voice was so not Randy.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC, EERIE WHISPERING)
The entire barn was engulfed in flames.
(FLAMES ROARING)
(GASPING)
I was being choked. I couldn't breathe.
(DISTORTED LAUGHTER)
(DISTORTED VOICES)
(DOOR UNLATCHES)
Get up. We got to get out of here.
(FLAMES CRACKLING)
To this day, we still don't know exactly what caused the barn to burn down.
I think Stephen Richards was sending us a message not to be messing with him.
(SIGHS) I can't even put it into words.
It was just... To me, it was magical.
It was miraculous.
We were one big happy family at last.
It was like, "Wow. We're free. There's nothing here to hurt us anymore."
Get it.
