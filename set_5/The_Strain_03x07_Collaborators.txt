Pop, I didn't come here to fight. I came here to warn you.
You need to get out of this city.
You appear after two years, and I'm supposed to flee my home on what?
The word of a stranger.
What is the status of the Aurora Cutlass?
The ship left port in Egypt.
Now we just need you to make sure that it ports here in New York.
We never cleared Central Park.
Until we take the Park back, we don't win.
The big nest. You have a plan?
Star-spangled time.
Rockets' red glare, bombs bursting in air. Boom.
Fire in the hole!
(Creatures screaming)
Pull up the checkpoint feeds.
: They lured us to keep us out after nightfall.
Pull out of the Park! Now! Withdraw! All units, withdraw!
It's over.
The strongest will prevail.
Where's my son?!
Your wife and your child call to you.
Ugh! Yaargh!

Wiped out a nest of thousands of munchers.
By the time we got to the surface, reinforcements overrunning Central Park.
It was a bloodbath, Professor.
You cannot defeat an army that can regenerate itself every few days, which is why we have to be more creative.
Putting 'em in a box.
Not just a box.
A box lined with silver and lead.
The silver will incapacitate the Master. The lead will cut off any signals from the Master to his army of strigoi.
Who am I to argue?
After what happened last night in Central Park, I, uh... don't know if the city's gonna make it.
Faith, Mr. Fet, stick close to it.
I see you've been busy, Doctor.
You don't know the half of it.
Strigoi brain stem.
(Growling)
We think this is their communication center.
: "We"?
You haven't been introduced.
Dutch Velders...
Yeah, I know what you are, who you are. Sorry.
Hmm...
What do you hope to gain from dissecting these unfortunate creatures?
Their communications ability is one of their distinct advantages.
We saw that in action in the Central Park massacre.
See this?
This is a sampling of all strigoi communication.
It's... varying but occupying a fairly predictable range. Until here.
That looks like a call to arms to me.
A direct signal from the Master, right?
A passage in the Lumen refers to "the silent voice of the Master."
Interesting, yet trivial.
Not if we can isolate it.
If we can set it out from the rest of the strigoi static, then we can use this technique to track him down.
So we need a point of reference.
JFK.
The black box.
: From Regis Air 753.
: It might still have his "voice" or whatever command he used to incapacitate 210 souls on board.
JFK, that's well outside the safe zone.
Even if we go in daylight, we don't know what we'd be getting ourselves into.

After all this time working together, I think that's the first time you asked me a personal question.
I never had reason to.
That's pretty simple.
Pop was a stubborn SOB; we never got along.
I never lived up to his high expectations, and... he never missed an opportunity to let me know it.
One day on the phone, we had a blowout, and, uh, I hung up. And that was six years ago.
Come on! Come on!
(Thundering explosion)
I finally broke the silence.
Went back to see him a couple of weeks ago, and I told him to get the hell out of the city.
You'd think he'd take some stock in what I had to say but... he didn't.
Generally, I've found that more intelligent people are usually among the last to accept the existence of strigoi, and therefore the last to flee.
But at least, he spared you the horror of having to release him.

My pop isn't the first one in my family to commit suicide.
His father, my grandfather, also shot himself because he couldn't live with something he had done.
As a Ukrainian soldier conscripted by the Russians, he was captured by the Nazis and forced to work for them.
Or chose to?
No one really knows.
However it happened, my grandfather was a Holocaust collaborator.
He killed Jews in the concentration camps.
To my pop, this was the shame of the family, you know?
And he never spoke of it.
I learned all this from my mother.
He shortened our name from Fetrovsky to Fet, and became an academic... you know, a life of the mind... to separate himself from his father's darkness.
That's why he... he hated me being an exterminator.
You know, someone who kills for a living.
He feared that darkness in himself... and in me.
The war caused many atrocities, Mr. Fet.
It exposed the worst in human behaviour.
He had a choice.
Some men seek not the right path but the safest one.
Some men believe only in survival, no matter what the costs.
Your father made the right decision.
The difficult decision.
It doesn't change what his father did, but it shows that he learned.
Now you must do for your father what he could not do for his.
You need to forgive him.
What good does my forgiveness do him now?
There is a saying, "To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that prisoner was you."
This is the place?

You're bluffing. What use is anything without the Master's identity?
A vessel owned by Stoneheart docked here in New York from Egypt, carrying a very important cargo.
What cargo?
Well, that's just it. I don't know.
Its contents were kept from me.
But clearly it is of immense importance to the Master.
Let's just go there.

Too late. I tried.

All dead.
