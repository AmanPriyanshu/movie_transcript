 Gotham...
: Who are you?
Oh, my word.
Please don't hurt me.
We caught a spy.
Ivy?
No!
Watch out!
(screams)
Ivy?
(crying)
: 
It's time to round up our friends.
(shouting)
: 
Former white knight cop. Now bounty hunter.
: 
: 
Who the hell are you, Jim Gordon?
Wait...
Shut up for once.
(drumroll)
(clucking)
(laughter)
(barking)
(imitating animals)
(chuckles)
When I count to three, you will all awake and have no memory of your animal identity.
One, two, three.
(laughter, cheering)
Thank you. Thank you.
A magician? Really?
Hypnotist. I like him.
Plus, the place is packed. Be happy.
: Just a taste, ladies and gentlemen.
But now let us venture into something more... arcane.
I'll need a single volunteer.
(audience murmuring)
Hmm.
You, sir.
Beautiful suit.
Thank you.
Lawyer?
Uh, doctor.
Oh.
Your mistress?
My-my wife.
Oh, delightful.
(laughter)
(watch ticking)
Listen to the watch.
The way it's ticking synchronizes with your heartbeat.
(heart beating, watch ticking)
Look into my eyes.
Not above them, not around them, (echoing): but deep into their center.
(heartbeat and ticking slow)
You are completely relaxed and are becoming weightless.
Are you ready to do something impossible?
Yes.
Stand upon the chair.
(audience chuckles, murmurs)
No.
The back of it.
Remember, you weigh nothing at all.
(audience gasping)
He'll fall.
Not at all, my dear.
(audience gasping)
In a hypnotic state, unburdened by doubt and fear, we can accomplish the impossible.
Now... one foot.
(audience gasping)
So you could get him to do anything you wanted?
Did you have something in mind, Miss Kean?
Jump down, sir.
(audience cheering)
(quietly): Lock sense away.
Awaken the rascal.
When I say it is so, your home is my castle.
Now, I'm going to count down and clap my hands and you will awake.
Three, two, one.
How do you feel, sir?
I feel great.
(chuckles)
Thank you!
(applause)
Thank you. (chuckles)
Very impressive, Mr. Tetch.
You have quite the gift.
But you didn't answer my question.
Can you make people do anything you tell them to do?
Only things they secretly wish to do.
It's surprising what people wish for, secretly, deep down.
Mm.
True.
You must be a very popular man.
Oh, I wish.
Parties like this help pay my way, so thank you.
And you're new to Gotham?
Yes. Just arrived from up north.
You have a place to stay?
Not yet.
But something always seems to turn up.
This is weird for me, too.
What's-what's your name?
Five.
Well, 514A, but they call me Five.
At Indian Hill?
Yes.
And how 'bout before that?
I-I don't remember... I don't remember anything before that.
That's convenient, isn't it?
I mean, nothing?
I mean, you must have had a home, family, friends, parents.
If I did, I can't remember.
I woke up in that lab over a year ago.
I was locked up the whole time I was there.
They gave me books, did tests on me.
Many tests.
I heard the other inmates in the halls, but I never saw them.
Not until Ms. Mooney broke us out.
I'm sorry I surprised you by coming here.
When-when I saw you...
I had to meet you.
You saw me?
On the rooftop.
With that girl.
Selina. She gave me money.
I followed her.
You're welcome to stay here as long as you need.
Perhaps we should contact someone with more expertise in these matters, Master Bruce.
It's late. That can wait until tomorrow.
I'll make up one of the guest rooms.
: Master Bruce, we have to get rid of that thing as quick as possible.
He's a human being, Alfred. He's in need of help.
Look, I-I understand you feel sorry for the boy, but have a butcher's at him, will you, huh?
I mean, he's you. Hugo Strange made another you.
I reckon it's got something to do with that secret society or something.
So what do we do?
Throw him back on the street? I-I want to know who and what and why as much as you do, Alfred.
Better he stays here until we find out.
Fine, but tomorrow we call Lucius Fox.
Maybe he'll know what to do with it. I mean, him.
(flame sizzles)
Valerie.
James.
You want some breakfast?
There's a place around the corner.
Pass.
I have to be at City Hall in an hour.
I have to go home and shower.
I have a shower.
No, you have a dark hole in the wall with no water pressure and one damp towel.
Right.
Well, I'm collecting my bounty from the GCPD today, so, uh, I can stop on my way home, make things a little... nicer.
Yeah, good luck with that.
That was fun.
See you around.
Okay. See ya.
: 
 but the simple truth is this department has missed you.
God-given talent like yours is hard to find.
Your expertise and your professionalism is exemplary.
I'm very pleased that you're returning to the GCPD.
Where else can you make a difference like this? Nowhere.
I know. It's not that...
Look...
(grunts) now, forgive me if I'm, uh, stepping into a delicate minefield, but if what you're worried about is Jim Gordon, he no longer works here.
No GCPD affiliation whatsoever.
(indistinct chatter)
Hey, Harvey.
Jim!
Buddy. Pal. Ha-ha.
Let's get a cup of coffee.
I just came by for my check.
City still owes me for bringing in the last of Strange's creeps.
Yeah, you been hustlin'...
: Jim?
Hello, Jim. What-what are you...
Hey. You look well.
Thanks.
You visiting?
No, we're... um, I'm-I'm moving here.
Permanently.
With my fiancé.
He's been offered head trauma position at Gotham General.
A doctor. Good call.
Captain Barnes has been nice enough to offer me my old job back. Here. Um...
I haven't decided yet.
Well, if you did, you'd see me.
I'm here now and again getting paid.
It's good to see you, Lee.
I guess I better get going. The movers are due any minute.
Be well, Jim.
Jim.
Where's my money, Harvey?
(thunder rumbling)
(phone ringing)
(grunts)
(clears throat)
Hello?
: Lock sense away.
Awaken the rascal.
When I say it is so, your home is my castle.
Go to the door.
(clock ticking)
(heart beating)
(ticking and beating slow)
(thunder crashing)
(wood creaking)
Honey?
(creaking nearby)
(thunder crashes)
Wh-Who are you?
: Who am I?
I haunt your dreams like a ghost, for I know what scares you most.
So you run, run!
(whimpering)
As fast as you can!
There's no escape from the magic man.
(screams)
Jolly good.
Now, get some plastic, wrap her up and bury her in the garden.
Oh, and I'm gonna need you to kill yourself, too.
Chop-chop.
(door opens)
My sweet sister.
Alice.
I've traveled so far.
So come out, come out, wherever you are.
(grunts)
(doorbell ringing rapidly)
(fervent knocking)
: Alice!
Hey! Alice!
(doorbell ringing rapidly)
(pounding)
(lock clicking)
This time, no excuses. My money... where is it?
I'll get it for you.
You said that last week, the week before that.
I should have known you're a liar.
A cheat!
I lost my job.
Then get another! Don't cheat me!
But, uh, perhaps... we work something out, eh?
If you're a nice girl?
Are you a nice girl?
Stay away from me.
Oh, be nice to me.
Stop, you don't understand.
(cackles) Be nice...
Oh!
(grunts)
(growls)
(grunting)
I'm so sorry.
(gurgling)
You shouldn't have done that.
You brought this on yourself.
(screams)
: 
 of Galavan, the office of mayor has been governed by the elected officials you see behind me.
This city desperately needs experienced, seasoned leadership.
And so, in their wisdom, they have persuaded me...
Much against my will...
To resume the office of mayor until elections can be organized in the new year.
Stop!
This proceeding is a sham.
Security, remove this criminal!
Criminal?
I was jailed illegally by a corrupt system.
A corrupt system that was put into place by this man, who has the audacity to put himself back into the position that he brought so much shame and dishonor to.
How dare you?
No, how dare you waltz up there and announce yourself mayor?
The people demand to have a say into who will represent them, who will protect them.
Yeah! Yeah!
: Yeah!
It was I...
I alone... who drove out the monsters that plagued our city.
Oh, please. Where were you then, while I faced peril at the hands of those abominations?
Sir, are you challenging James's appointment to office?
I most certainly am.
(crowd clamoring)
You better get a close-up.
(applause)
(mic feedback)
To govern this city, one should be
 elected, which is why I, Oswald Cobblepot, announce my candidacy for the office of mayor.
(crowd clamoring)
And I demand, and the people demand, that an emergency election be held forthwith!
(cheering and applause)
: Cobblepot! Cobblepot! Cobblepot!
Good, good, good.
(grunting and panting)
One more time, one more time.
And again.
(exhaling sharply)
Good boy.
One more time.
Good morning.
(exhales) Did you sleep well?
: Yes.
Would you like to try?
: Uh, I don't think that's a particularly good idea, do you Master Bruce?
Come now, Alfred, I think a little exercise before breakfast might be just what he needs.
Fine.
I'll go easy on you. Pop these on.
Right hand in. And the other one.
Like that. All right, step up.
Now, just remember...
Let's see what you got, no, keep your gloves up.
Protect the chin at all times, all right?
Ready? Here we go. Bosh.
Ready?
(exhales sharply)
Come on.
(Alfred grunts)
: Sorry. Sorry...
No, ab-absolutely fine.
Let's see if we can do that again.
Here I come.
(spits) Bloody hell.
Who taught you how to do that then?
No one.
If they did, I... I don't remember.
Right, well, let's see what you got, sunshine.
Here we go again. Here we go.
(grunting)
: Oh.
Oh, dear. I'm frightfully sorry.
What for?
Your nose.
: Didn't you feel it?
No.
Should I?
Right, well, I think that's, uh... quite enough for today, don't you, Master Bruce?
Here you are.
Press that hard against your nose.
All right? Here you go.
Stem the flow.
Good lad.
Well, that's a very nasty scar.
Where'd you get that? Or can't you remember?
What did they do to you in there?
Good day, Mr. Gordon.
Tea?
: 
Oh, you're famous, sir.
Your name's in the papers.
The fearless bounty hunter.
I want you to find my sister.
We're very close.
We lost our parents at an early age.
I became her guardian.
But her condition proved too much for me. I sought help.
The worst kind.
The fiend, Professor Strange.
Her condition?
Some poison in her blood.
Very rare. Unique, in fact.
He took her in.
Said she needed constant supervision.
He wouldn't let me see her.
You go to the police?
Useless.
This is Gotham after all.
The years passed and I lost hope.
But then I heard about the breakout.
I assumed she escaped with others.
But now she is out there.
Alone.
Afraid.
Indian Hill escapees get five grand from the GCPD.
You able to top that?
I'll double it.
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you very much.
Leave your number.
You've seen so much pain and tragedy, Mr. Gordon.
I hope it hasn't left you too alone.
: 
I'm just saying, it's a big step.
Holy crap.
(phones ringing)
Headquarters, let me just say one thing first.
Gotham is rife with crime, Butch.
Who better than a criminal to clean it up?
Okay. Look, you know I've faced the worst Gotham has to offer, but politicians, they scare me.
The people of Gotham are with me.
They are scared, which means angry.
And who have they got to turn to?
Aubrey James? (scoffs)
Please.
That man is a hack.
This is my opportunity to create a legacy.
One that my father would be proud of.
: Mr. Cobblepot?
Oh.
What do you think?
(sighs)
You got my vote.
(chuckles)
Mr. Cobblepot, I have Aubrey James.
He'd like to meet you, alone.
Hmm.
What are you looking for?
The scars on your back are distinctive.
I was hoping to find a reference, a clue as to why they were made.
(door opens)
You need to hide.
What?
She won't understand.
What are you doing?
Homework.
Is something wrong?
(sighs)
Ivy's missing.
She'll turn up somewhere.
Doesn't she always?
This time, she fell.
And it was a long way down into water.
And maybe she survived.
I got a bad feeling.
No offense, but... it's not like you to care.
She had nothing, that kid.
I was it.
No one else would even talk to her.
(chuckles)
I shouldn't give up, right?
Maybe take one more look at the shelters, our favorite hiding spots?
Sure.
Good idea.
(sighs)
Will you come with me?
If I had a car, I could get around much quicker.
Uh, yeah, I mean... no.
No. Not-not right now. I just...
What?
That's too much to ask?
After everything I've done for you?
Selina, it's not like that. I...
(sighs) Forget it.
It was stupid of me to even come here.
Sel... I just... It's-it's just not a good time.
(scoffs)
You're a selfish son of a bitch. You know that, right?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
(mimics Bruce's voice): I'm sorry.
Selina?
What do you want? I'm looking for someone. I think you may have seen her.
And if I have, why would I tell you?
She's in trouble, and I can pay you.
(sighs)
I don't need your money.
So what do you need?
Ivy.
She's missing.
For how long?
Too long.
(sighs) Just... keep an eye open for her, would you?
Will do.
She's from Indian Hill.
Yeah.
I saw her with Mooney, but only for a day or two.
Last I heard, she got a job at The Narrows Bar.
All right. Thanks.
(door creaks open, shuts)
(animal squeaking)
(door opens)
Who the hell are you?!
You a cop?
Nope.
Well, if you're looking to rob the place, you're too late.
Fire took everything I had.
I'm looking for someone.
Her name's Alice.
This some kind of joke?
No. What's funny?
That crazy bitch is the one who started the fire.
Why'd she do that?
How the hell do I know?!
Said she cut herself. "Clean yourself up then," I say.
"You don't understand," she says.
"My blood is on the counter." Next thing I know, the whole damn kitchen's in flames.
Someone's got to pay for this damage.
You tell me where she is, my client will pay.
Who's your client?
You know where she is?
If I did, would I be talking to you?
Thanks for your time.
I say when we're done.
(gun chamber clicks)
Time to teach you some manners.
(grunting)
(loud thudding, grunting)
You had enough?
(grunts)
Not yet.
(grunting)
(thudding)
(panting)
Now I have.
(groans)
(sighs)
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)
I'm sorry for the delay.
Gotham Friday nights keep us busy.
How you feeling?
Uh. I'll be fine.
Might want to take your shirt off.
Don't want to bloody it up.
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)
(sighs)
James Gordon, the policeman.
Used to be.
I don't need to tell you it's gonna hurt a little bit.
There we go.
Oh. Yeah.
Lee speaks very highly of you.
I'm Mario, Lee's fiancé.
That's nice of her.
Look, Jim, I don't know where your head's at with all this, but I want you to know that I love her very much.
I'm gonna take good care of her.
Good to know.
So we're okay?
Yeah. sure.
Why wouldn't we be?
Lee and I are old news, water under the bridge.
Won't get any problem from me.
Uh... wish you both nothing but the best.
Thank you.
All done.
But, uh... you ever were to hurt her, I'd have to hunt you down and kill you.
(laughs)
Hey, uh, look, um, about three days ago, a girl might have come in here with burns on her.
Ring any bells? I need an address.
Look familiar?
(horns honking)
(opera music plays)
A public place. Smart.
Knowing your flare for the dramatic, I felt it necessary.
(laughs)
How flattering.
But why exert myself needlessly?
The public sees me as a man of action, of change. You...
You are yesterday's sad joke.
While Galavan humiliated this city, where were you?
In a warehouse with a box on your head.
You're an unstable lunatic, Penguin, and people are gonna see right through you.
I've got the judges, the unions, the GCPD, and a whole team of legal experts behind me.
What do you got?
I have me.
(laughs)
You're psychotic!
(gun chambers clicking, women screaming)
(woman whimpering)
Not this time, Penguin.
My head will not be put in a box again.
Oh, you.
So smart. Always one step ahead.
(gun chambers clicking)
Never three.
Relax. I do not want you dead.
Besides, what kind of fun would an election be if I were the only candidate, huh? Oh.
You're right about one thing, though.
I do need a little help, and I have just the right person in mind.
(door creaks open)
(man grunting)
Hello?
(man coughing)
(loud knocking)
(man groaning)
Hello?
(muffled groaning, loud knocking)
(man groaning)
(man laughing)
(man speaking gibberish)
(man yelling)
No one lies to me! Don't lie!
(gunshots)
(man groaning)
: Any of his blood get on you?
No.
Hello, Alice.
I wasn't sure how he turned.
Turned? What's wrong with him?
He's infected.
Infected with what?
With me. Who are you?
Why are you here?
Your brother's looking for you.
He can't... find me.
Alice. Alice!
(crickets chirping)
(door closes)
: He's gone.
He's taken some of your clothes and the keys to the Roller.
Cut his hair, too.
To look more like you.
We have to go after him.
(buzzer sounds)
: 
 who scheduled this meeting, Mr. Cobblepot, but as you can see, I have been burdened with restoring order to this facility, and that is no easy task.
A man of your reputation should not have been sent here to clean up Strange's wreckage.
Indeed.
Get off me! Let me go!
You are aware of my ambitions?
(buzzer sounds)
For office?
Oh.
Once mayor, I will grant you whatever position you care to request.
Gotham's Head of Psychiatry, a chair on Gotham's Board of Health?
In exchange for what exactly?
Even though my victory is inevitable, I fear my campaign is missing one key element.
A colleague of mine is locked up here. Unfairly.
Are you suggesting that I release a convicted criminal out onto the street?
Well, yes. For your betterment.
That would take extensive patient analysis, uh, probational hearings, appeals...
(alarm rings)
 (over P.A.): Lockdown is now in full effect.
Repeat, lockdown...
Of course, there's always plan B.
I give you nothing... (gulps) but I make sure you remain here forever.
 as a warden, no.
(chuckles)
I would see you scrub floors and empty inmates' latrines.
Oh...
Options.
(chuckles nervously)
(watch ticking)
Look into my eyes.
Not around them, not above them, but into their center.
Now sleep.
(watch ticking)
(watch closes, ticking stops)
Now, what would we like to see the lovely Miss Kean do?
Physical feats?
A trip into her psyche?
She said we needed more whimsy.
(audience laughs)
Barbara?
When I count down from three, you will find me irresistible.
You will be madly in love with me.
(laughing)
Three... two... one.
(gasps)
Barbara?
Do you care for me?
Oh, yes.
(audience gasps, murmurs)
Do you love me?
Very much.
(audience gasping)
: Ooh...
But... what if I can't feel the same?
Oh, dear.
What if I love another?
I'm sorry, Barbara, my dear, but...
(audience gasps)
Three, two, one, awake.
She's a bit sensitive to rejection.
(chuckles)
Ladies and gentlemen, the great Jervis Tetch.
(audience cheering)
: Bravo!
(indistinct chatter, laughter)
(quiet ballad plays in background)
Did you find her?
I found her.
Lost her.
She shot a man and set fire to his body.
Said she had an infection.
Also said, she doesn't want anything to do with you.
You want to tell me what the hell is going on?
It's complicated.
My next stop will be the GCPD.
You can explain it to them.
Please, don't do that.
Let's talk somewhere private.
Allow me to explain the situation.
(horns honk in distance)
So what does Alice have in her blood that makes it so infectious?
(watch opens, ticks)
She doesn't look sick to me.
(door closes)
She's not sick.
She's powerful, sir.
Powerful how?
I need answers, Tetch!
You deserve some.
Do you hear my watch ticking?
(watch ticking)
Yeah.
Listen closer.
The ticking, it synchronizes with your heartbeat, yes?
(ticking slows)
Look into my eyes.
Not above them, or around them, into their center.
Are you asleep, Jim?
Yes.
Show me.
Take out your gun and put it on the ground.
Good.
Now walk to the edge and climb onto the wall.
Been such a long, hard road for you, Jim Gordon.
You are so very tired of life, aren't you?
: Yes.
Now you can rest, Jim.
Close your eyes.
Sleep forever.
: Deep down, you want to die, Jim.
You want to end this miserable, empty, loveless life, don't you?
Yes!
Yes.
Let me help you.
I'm going to count to ten.
When I reach ten, you will simply step off the ledge and you will find everlasting peace.
Ready? Yes.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Stop!
Alice?
Thank God!
At last, I've found you!
Tell that man to get off the ledge.
Never mind him.
Put down the gun.
Mister!
Get down!
He can't hear you.
Don't come near me.
Why are you here if you don't want to talk?
Put the gun down, Alice.
You're evil.
Leave me alone!
Or I'll kill you!
But, Alice, I love you.
(screams)
(Alice screams)
(both panting)
Thank you.
(crickets chirping)
(dogs bark in distance)
I'm sane.
Absolutely.
100%. I examined you myself.
And the murder of Miss Kringle?
Committed while you were insane.
Officer Dougherty.
Insane.
Officer Pinkney.
Insane.
And now I'm...
Sane.
And not responsible for any of the acts perpetrated during your sickness.
You're a free man, Edward.
Not to look a gift horse in the mouth, but how did you...
(engine idling)
Never mind.
(window lowering)
Hello, old friend.
(elegant piano music playing)
Still thinking about your meeting with Jim?
No.
There's nothing left to say.
It's all in the past now.
It's been less than a year.
I think there's plenty to say.
After all you went through with him, I just need to know that nothing's left unsaid.
Well, you should speak to him yourself, then.
I did.
You did?
Mm-hmm.
Something you could have mentioned the moment we sat down.
When? How?
It's not like I wasn't gonna tell you.
He came into the ER, he needed stitches.
Of course.
So I took the opportunity to introduce myself.
He didn't make the connection at first, because, um... you hadn't told him my name.
It never came up.
Right.
What do you mean, "right"?
: Did I enter at a bad time?
Glad you could make it, Dad.
I'm honored that you invited me.
(elegant piano music playing)
When Mario was born, I promised my wife that he would never be part of our thing.
That we'd raise him to lead a good, honest life.
And we did.
And he has.
He can't use the Falcone name, but he's brought true honor to the family.
My wife is looking down on us now, and she's so proud and happy.
She would love you, Lee.
You're exactly the kind of woman she would have wished for her son.
Thank you.
There's only one thing that would've worried her.
Oh?
My wife would say you're a little too beautiful.
All the great tragedies start with a face like yours.
Makes men fall in love when they shouldn't.
Makes them do crazy things.
Dad, really?
You're referring to Jim Gordon.
I've spoken with him.
He's moved on.
I'm fine; he's fine.
We both have.
You've got nothing to worry about.
Here's to both of you.
A blessed union.
(vehicle approaching)
What the hell are you doing here?
I wanted to apologize for the way I treated you last night.
I'm sorry. I was insensitive and rude.
Hmm.
Does Alfred know you have his car?
No.
Why tell him? It's mine, not his.
Would you like to go for a ride?
Are you hungry?
What's with you?
You seem... different.
Is that a bad thing?
Mm.
I could eat.
Don't wait up, losers.
