So I opened the door to the arboretum, and there they were!
And I have no idea where the orangutan came from.
Yeah, I mean, how far is the nearest zoo?
And why was he so set on getting my pistachios?
It's the mysteries that make life worth living.
At least that's what it says in my expensive book of mysteries.
Today we are starting on a new physics project.
This will test everything you've learned about gravity, inertia and weight distribution.
All things I utilized in making this beautiful desk.
Solid oak.
[ROMANTIC MUSIC]
Took me the better part of 21 weeks.
Mmm.
[CLEARS THROAT]
[STAMMERING] If you work hard, someday you too may own a special desk.
Not this one, though. This one's mine.
So, over the weekend, you will be building a container, inside of which you will put an egg.
Your grade will be based on only one criteria.
An unbroken egg guarantees the team an A.
All the others will be judged on how well they have applied the concepts we've been talking about in class.
Now, you will all be breaking into teams of three.
So, I guess you three will be a team then?
Cowards.
Any limit on the number of eggs we break while we're building it?
No.
Okay then.
You sure you don't wanna join our team, Melissa?
I named it "Team Melissa."
Not after you. Different Melissa.
No, I'm good.
Really? You're gonna jeopardize those straight A's?
You know, eggs can be rather fragile.
Bring it on. I eat eggs for breakfast!
Yeah, so do all of us.
: Coming!
I got eight dozen eggs. That should last us...
Like I said, I got four dozen eggs.
Wow!
That's a lot of eggs.
I've got a grade point average to protect.
You think that's maybe a little bit overkill? [CREAKING]
No, I do not think it is overkill.
Touché.
So, shall we get crackin'?
That's eggs-actly...
No! No egg puns.
[MUSIC]
Whoa!
Did you just put an egg in your pocket?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's not gonna end well.
Aah?
[BIRD SQUAWKS]
Okay, guys, we are going to crack this thing.
And by that, I mean we are not going to crack this thing.
We have to build something that can withstand a two-story drop, 
: Hey...
: It's all in here. We have to build something that will withstand not only one of these things, but all of them simultaneously.
Well, you know what they say.
Whatever breaks our egg only helps our egg dropping contraption utilize the forces of gravity, inertia and weight distribution better.
That's the spirit!
Who says that?
[SQUISHING]
Okay, team. I give you version 87.3 dash 9.
I'm not naming them anymore. I don't wanna get attached.
Come here, Diogee. [PANTING]
Here it goes.
Okay, looking good.
[GRUNTS] Wait.
Okay.
I think. [GRUNTS]
Well?
The egg is... completely intact!
We did it!
Whoo-hoo!
I've gotta see this. I'll be right down!
Whoa, whoa, no! You stay right there, Milo!
I'll guard Big Bertha for the night.
And Melissa, you take home all the extra eggs.
What extras? That was our last one.
Really? Well, here, then.
Triple-cooler it.
And we'd better get out of here 
: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look out! No brakes!
Whoa!
[GRUNTS]
[ALARM SOUNDING]
Hi, kids.
Hi, Mr. Murphy, we gotta go, bye!
See you tomorrow, team!
[YAWNING]
Okay, Big Bertha, time to get you to schoo...
[GASPS]
No!
[GASPS] Huh. Just a dream.
All right. Time to rise and... [GASPS]
No!
[GASPS] Oh, it's just a dream.
[GASPS]
Well, that is peculiar.
[GASPS] Yeah, that's more like it.
[BELL RINGING]
How's Big Bertha doing?
Good so far. How's the egg?
A-okay!
Let's just get this thing to the classroom.
Three o'clock!
[YELLS]
Ten o'clock!
Actual clock!
He's already here, isn't he?
How'd you guess?
Hi, guys!
Milo, I need to take the egg out. Do you mind?
No problem. I'll stand in the corner.
I'm helping by not helping.
Pilot egg is ready for drop-off.
Whoo-hoo! Oops!
Heads up!
[ALL SCREAMING]
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
That was our last one. Now we can't even compete!
I am so sorry, Melissa. I don't know what to say.
Oh, wait a second. I forgot this one!
Okay, class, take your projects up to the roof while I monitor the drop zone. [LAUGHS]
And send one of your team members down with me for clean-up.
I'll be on the ground crew. Good luck, guys.
And FYI, a tremendous portion of my self-esteem is wrapped up in my grade point average, but, you know, no pressure.
You know, I made that pencil you're holding.
Look, with all our trials and errors, this baby can now handle anything.
Okay, let's go down the check list one more time.
[SQUISHING]
Parachute?
Check.
With 1.5 second deploy speed.
Shock absorbers?
[SQUISHING] Check.
Compressed air plungers braced by interior bendy straws.
Think of my desk! I know I am.
Roll cage?
Check. Vacuum hose with closed foam core.
Oh, uh, yeah, no. Get the mop over here.
We'll show you how it's done.
Bradley's team is the one to beat.
Yeah! In your face, other people!
I'm on your team.
I hope it works. I don't wanna let Melissa down.
Come on. How much can happen between here and the ground?
Come on, hold together.
Okay. One, two...
Yes, yes, yes...
Hey, is this the cafeteria service entrance?
No, no, no!
Uh-oh! Kickball game!
Check, she can handle that!
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
Football scrimmage!
Uh... check, theoretically.
[MUSIC]
[GROWLING]
Polar bear water tank.
What? Give me those!
So, that's where the zoo is.
[GROWLS, SPLASH]
: Uh... check.
Wind turbines!
Uh... check?
News copter!
Come on.
Oh, come on.
[BARKS]
Not you, Diogee.
Seriously, can someone help me out?
I gotta deliver all these eggs.
[GROWLS]
[BARKS]
We have a winner! Team Milo gets an A!
You three did it. I'm so proud of you.
Now, that's a grade A egg.
[BARKS]
Well, I guess the yolk's on...
I said no egg puns!
