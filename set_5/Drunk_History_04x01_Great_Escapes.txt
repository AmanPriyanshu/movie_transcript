Good day to you, my friends.

I have a quick question I want to ask you.
How much is acid?
Okay.
There's my answer.
(Giggles)
Well, it should be free.
(Giggles)
(Laughs)
They're psychopaths!
You're dealing with a psycho... you're dealing with, like, lunatics.
Timothy... okay, so...
And the sentence is 30 years.
San Luis Obisbal.
(Chuckles)
(Giggles)
I can't even sit up.
(Sighs)
He called him baby.
(Laughing) Yeah.
Rosemary raised $23,000.
So the Weather Underground was a group of activist students.
Timothy Leary was playing handball, doing [bleep] bench presses, sit-ups, getting ripped.
So on September 12, 1970, 
Runs that way through it.
So he's hanging... really think about this, man!
(Chuckling)
This is Galileo!
This is one of the smartest people that ever lived!
This is one of the smartest of us.
I'm with you.
All right.
And that's what he did.
Half mile, he's been training for this.
(Both laughing)
He was Rocky Balboa. He...
(Both laughing)
Now you have to say it.
He was Rocky Balboa!
(Dramatic music)
So they capture him again.
He leaves a free man.
He went to jail for nothing.
He was in prison 'cause he was too smart.
What are your dogs' names?
This is Fox and that's Gatsby.
It's ruining everything.
I knew they would.
I thought they were being locked away in that basement?
Well, they got out.
Escaped. My [bleep] dogs...
Great...
: Escape!
Have you ever escaped from anywhere?
Omaha.
How did you escape?
Oh, I just got in my car and drove.
You didn't tell your parents?
No, I said... you know, be back for Christmas.
(Laughs)

Hello, I'm Steve Berg and today, we're gonna be talking about Devil's Island.
William was a guy who had no idols.
Except the fictional character of Don Quixote.
In 1938, William injures his leg, 
 about her son, Bernard.
Amongst the worst oppon... am...
And that was a big thing for him.
That's why he went on these adventures.
Haven't you heard that song?
There was a musical made about it.
That's a great one.
I auditioned for it. Didn't get the part.
(Chuckles)
True story.
Anyway...
And Jules says to him right away... he sees William Willis smile.
And William's like, okay, I like the cut of this guy's jib.
Maybe he's my Sancho Panza.
Jules is like, 
(Hiccups)
(Burps)
All right.
Sorry, one second.
(Clears throat) So they sail around and finally, they get to Devil's Island.
And it is the place that you would call hell on Earth.
(Mumbling): No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
And the witch doctor slices open parrots.
(Both laughing)
Meanwhile, his main man, Jules

Hello, I'm Doug Jones, and today, we're gonna talk about Charles Joughin, the chief baker of the RMS "Titanic," who saved his own life by drinking whiskey.
That was great.
(Laughs)
Also, Charles Joughin was a lover of the booze.
All right, so April 14, 1912, 
(Screeches)
The little bit of whiskey made him keep his cool.
Takes them, throws them down.
(Laughs)
Okay, keep going.
The process of the sinking 
I blew the alcohol into my face.
(Exhales)
I'm doing a good job.
(Foghorn blaring)
(Foghorn blaring)
RMS.
Mm-hmm.
RMS stands for "Royal Mail Ship."
Do you know how it was a mail ship?
No.
It had a big fat dick.
(Laughs)
That's the joke.
There's a huge crash.
He just kept his cool.
He said out loud, 
Charles Joughin was the very last person on the RMS "Titanic."
The rescue ship finally arrived.
(Laughs)
(Both laughing)
I'm gonna... I'm gonna shoot it with you.
But do you realize, we're about to be [bleep] freezing cold?
Remember... This is for Charles Joughin.
If he can do it, I can do it.
All right.
(Screams)
(Laughs)
(Both screaming and laughing)
Okay. Whoo!
Let's get in the oven.
Ugh.
Where's the oven?
