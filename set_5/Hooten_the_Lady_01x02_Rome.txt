Uh, Rome.
Wow!

If a page survives... perhaps the rest of the book does, and it would be valuable.
If it's money you need, I'll get it for you, you don't have to sell your relics.
No.
We must find it.
That's the Vatican's symbol.
Are they the buyers?

We have a friend, in Rome, they will find a buyer. Call them, when you find it.
Anything for you, Sister.

That look would be God's hand guiding me.
: We can start in the library.
: Let's work backwards. General Stilicho had the Sibylline book in 4 or 5 AD.
He must have given it to the Church... Why?
Christians believe the Sibylline book prophesies the arrival of Christ.
It would have been a very useful tool in the process of conversion.
So why doesn't the Sibylline book have pride of place?
Because people are converted. There's only one book the Church wants people reading.
The Bible.
So they hid it.
What did you say the... name of... the founder of your nun's convent was?
: Father Francesco.
And stop saying "nun" like I made her up.
: I knew I'd seen his name somewhere!
Look!
Here's his diary.
Francesco tore out the stamped page in protest at its censorship.
Then somebody called Simoni hid the rest of it.
I don't suppose it says where ?
I don't... I don't completely understand, it says
[MYSTERIOUS MUSIC]
Francesco goes to the convent, to your convent, and then Simoni stays in Rome. He writes to Francesco. He says;
"It is hidden, Father. The key is in my book."
