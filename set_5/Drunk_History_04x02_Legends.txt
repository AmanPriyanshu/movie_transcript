Have you ever known a legend?
I don't know, I think it's too soon to tell.
I know a couple people in good runnings...
So legends have to be dead?
I think so, because otherwise, then, if you're... if you're not dead, you're a hero.
Not like those frat guys that... you got to meet my buddy; he's a legend.
No, that is... those are legends.
Those are true legends.

Sam Patch.
The first daredevil.
It's not even the 1900s yet, and it's just past the 1700s.
So young Sam Patch was working in cotton mills 14, 16 hours a day.
So Sam Patch, like all of his older coworkers, would spend their very little break time next to the river, watching the falls that powered these mills, and so Sam Patch started jumping off 
 and Sam Patch turned out to be very, very good at it.
He would... he would pass around a hat, take, like, pennies to help supplement his income.
So Sam Patch wants to do the biggest jump of his life, 
Sam Patch goes to the falls, screams out to the crowd, some things can be done as well as others.
Takes a few steps back, runs and takes a leap into the air, and then plunges feetfirst in his trademark straight-as-an-arrow dive.
Waves to everybody.
People lose their mind.
That was awesome.
That was awesome. That was sick.
All right, so Sam Patch... on top of the world.
On top of the world.
He's doing great.
That's... that's what you did back then.
If you got to a certain level of success, 
Well, what should we call the bear?
There's no record of a name that Sam gave his bear, but I'm 100% sure that his bear's name was...
Bomzi.
Bomzi?
I feel like I can do better than Bomzi.
Don't... just don't worry about it. So...
I still think I can do better than Bomzi.
Don't worry about Bomzi.
I am. I am.
All right, move on from Bomzi and just talk about Patch.
I mean, you can keep on telling me what you want me to say, but I'm gonna keep on giving you gold.
(Chuckles) All right, so he decides...
So he gets the bear.
Oh, you want to tell the story?
No, no.
He would go to his jumps.
He'd bring the bear up and then convince the bear that he should jump first.

So Ella's on the chitlin circuit.
She's killing it everywhere.
Chitlin circuit is for anybody who's black that performs.
Now, let's talk about the Mocambo.
Can we really quickly?
This is a place where Lana Turner, Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant... this was the hot spot, and you couldn't do it bigger,

She's too chubby.
She's too ugly.

People didn't get it, and they were like, can't you just be our hot thing with no clothes on with the dress blowing up that we love so much?
And she was like, no, I can't.
I want to do some real acting.
So Marilyn Monroe goes in to her voice teacher.
I want to do everything.
I'm taking this class in acting, I'm doing these dancing classes, blah-de-blah-blah, you are my man for the voice.

Her voice coach says, if you want to learn how to sing, buy Ella Fitzgerald's album.
She gets this record.
She lays down on the floor 
She goes, this is the most astonishing voice I've ever heard in my life.
She calls the Mocambo, and they're like, 
Marilyn Monroe, what the [bleep]?

And then people are a-going crazy.
And one person is like, I didn't even know music could sound like that.
And then Marilyn was like, I've heard these songs before.
But I never heard them.
What is going on right now?
Like, I can't even understand my own mind.
That is a human voice singing to us.
And Marilyn, true to her word, 
One night, after Ella performed, Marilyn came backstage.
(Uplifting orchestral music)
So, so, it's just two girls talking about what real life is like.
And, uh... what's her name?
Then Marilyn's like, I had two marriages, and Ella's like, oh, my God, I was married to somebody when I was really young, and then I married another guy.
And then Marilyn was like, I cannot be accepted in this business because of the way that I look.
And Ella's like, I cannot be accepted in this business because of the way that I look!
And these two women, they literally meet each other.
Because Marilyn Maloa... Mon... Meh...
Marilyn Mon...

Maroe... Maroe.
But anyway.
In this moment, that Marilyn helps Ella, she frees them both.
And when Marilyn passes away, because they stayed friends, 
After she personally called the managers of the Mocambo room and allowed me to play there, I was never, ever, ever, ever again in my life relegated to a small club.
She says, Marilyn was extraordinary and ahead of her time.
She loved that lady.
I got to say, here's to people who know when to shut their damn mouths.
Less talking, more texting.
Why are you talking?

Hello, I'm Patrick Walsh, and today we're gonna be talking about the life of Buster Keaton.
Buster Keaton was born to a family of vaudeville performers who toured the country with legendary magician Harry Houdini.
Buster was actually born Joseph Keaton, but when he was 18 months old, 
He can take a lot of sh1t.
And his parents laughed, they were like...
(Laughing) We should call him Buster!
That's a great idea, famed magician Harry Houdini.
♪ ♪
And in fact, they would say, step right up, come see the little boy who could not be damaged.
His father would throw his son into walls, 
And Buster loved it.
He was always fine. He had no marks.
He knew how to take a fall.
Could take a lot of abuse.
In a fun way.
They started referring to him as The Great Stone Face, which was his nickname, really, up until the end of his career.
Buster had a big admirer in Charlie Chaplin, who was the biggest silent film star of all time.
Chaplin, while touring the country with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D.W. Griffith, Chaplin was basically like, guys, we could sort of make our own artist-run movie studio, and we could have complete creative control over the projects we make, and other artists might want to come to us to enjoy that creative freedom.
And D.W. Griffith said, you know, that's awesome, because we can keep black people out as well.
And they all, you know, looked at him a little strange.
They weren't quite sure what he meant by that, and he said, you know, we could tell more stories about how the Ku Klux Klan came to power and how they are the most glorious organization in America's history.
And they were like, yeah, or we could, you know, do other kind of fun stuff and kind of more creative stuff...
No, but the Ku Klux Klan!
You know, I want to make all my... my sweet, sweet Ku Klux Klan movies.
And they were like, maybe we should quit hanging out with D.W.
And he was like, guys, come on.
Ku Klux Klan? Right?
You guys love it. I love it.
America loves it.
He was a racist... D.W Griffith.
You can do what you want to do, we won't bother you, you'll have creative control.
Buster Keaton responded with a hearty nod.
Buster, we're gonna be big, big stars, baby.
And he embarked on, from 1920 to 1929, the greatest run of filmmaking in the history of movies.
Buster had complete creative control.
He was making these amazing movies with these amazing stunts.
So, at the end of the 1920s, Buster Keaton was doing very well critically and commercially, 
Charlie Chaplin goes, Buster, baby...
♪ ♪
You're making a big mistake here.
They're not gonna give you the creative freedom that we gave you here at United Artists.
I know you want the more money.
I know you want to impress your wife.
You can't do it.
So he decides to sacrifice his creative control and freedom, and he went to MGM, and almost immediately, he realized he had made a huge mistake.
♪ ♪
I don't even know where I... where I left off.
It's okay.
At this point, it's just gonna be pure garbage.
That's okay.
Okay.
There is no garbage here.
Okay.
He went completely bankrupt.
His wife divorced him, and he became an extreme alcoholic, so MGM terminated his contract.
1932 to 1934 is the lowest point of Buster Keaton's life.
Things got so bad for Buster with the drinking, they eventually put him in a sanitarium... like, an insane asylum.
And, as was not uncommon at this time, they put him in a straitjacket, because they figured that's the only way they can cure a true alcoholic of drinking.
But little did they know...
So they put him in a straitjacket.
Within about five minutes, Buster's able to get out.
He breaks free of the sanitarium, and he's out on his own.
Eventually he learned, if he wanted to cure himself of drinking, he was gonna have to do it by himself.
You know, he's having hallucinations, saying, come on, Buster, like, you can get through this, you can beat this.
(Dramatic music)
And eventually he does.
He no longer wants to be drunk all day.
And he's able to go back to MGM and get his career back.
And in 1960, he won a lifetime achievement award.
Buster was like, look, I know people think that my life was probably pretty shitty.
The fact of the matter is, my life was great.
I got way more things than I ever expected to get.
My life was way better than I ever expected it to be.
So when things got kind of shitty, I was kind of like, all right, I expect there to be a balance of good and sh1t, and you got to treat both like, okay, all right.
Take the good with the bad... you take the good, you take the bad, you take 'em both, and there you have the facts of life.
He was a big Charlotte Rae fan.
