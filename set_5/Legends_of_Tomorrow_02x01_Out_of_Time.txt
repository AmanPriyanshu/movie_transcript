Heywood, Dr. Nate Heywood.
I'm... here to talk about Sara Lance, Ray Palmer, and the rest of the Legends.
I think they're all in trouble.
Thank you for not having me arrested back there.
Those security guards really overreacted.
You know, one of 'em tried to Mace me.
Dr. Heywood, I only agreed to give you five minutes, which was three minutes ago, because Ray and Sara are friends of mine, but I don't know the first thing about any Legends.
Of course you do, because you're the Green Arrow.
Excuse me?
Huh?
We're done here.
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to drop a bomb on you like that, it's just, I've exhausted all my normal avenues, and you're the only person left who won't think I'm crazy.
Are you sure about that?
I'm a historian.
I specialize in deductive historical reconstruction.
In layman's terms, I'm a time detective, which I really don't have to be to look at a calendar to see one week after you came to this city, Robin Hood showed up.
You said that Sara and Ray are...
Traveling throughout time with the other Legends.
"Legends" is what they call themselves.
Now, for the past six months, I've been noticing subtle changes to history... Almost imperceptible.
Actually, if it wasn't for a friend of mine who's a quantum physicist, I wouldn't have been able to detect the subliminal alterations.
The point being, I think your friends are responsible.
[sighs]
You're looking at me like you want evidence.
Evidence, okay, an illuminated manuscript from 1216 depicting a knight...
Looks a lot like your friend Dr. Palmer...
Same nose and and chin.
Erratic text describing a woman in white with a bo staff.
Uh, hieroglyphic from Mesopotamia depicting an albeit crude ship that flies through the air and disappears.
Let's skip to the part where they're in trouble.
UFO sighting, New York City, 1942, multiple witnesses report a flying machine diving into the Atlantic, which matches not only the Mesopotamian hieroglyphics but...
[clears throat] The part where they're in trouble!
Contemporaneous with the sighting were multiple reports of an underwater detonation of an atomic bomb!
Now, the government has denied this.
You said 1942.
That's three years before...
Before the atomic bomb was supposedly invented, yes.
I told you history was changing.
Dr. Heywood, if the Legends' ship met an A-bomb, they're not in trouble...
They're dead.
Are you seeing the sonar readings of the sea floor?
Either that's a really weird-looking rock formation... or the wreckage of a time ship.

Gideon and I have calculated a 96% likelihood of another aberration in Bhopal, 1912.
Why can't it be Aruba, 2016?
For real. We've been going non-stop for the past six months.
Nobody wants to address the fact that Cardinal Richelieu's men were armed with laser guns?

They had laser guns.

Well, that was fun.
I'm in no mood for a lecture, Sara.
Too tired from dishing 'em out?
Replacing the Time Masters is an enormous responsibility, Sara, and one which I fear our team is ill equipped...
[explosion rumbling]
Gideon, are we under attack?
A what?
A disturbance in the temporal zone caused by an unusually large aberration.
You never mentioned a time quake before.
I've never experienced one before. Gideon?
That's not... possible.
Wait, what wasn't possible?
What?
You said you and the Legends discovered an aberration in 1942, what was it?
My guess is it involved Nazis.
You could say that.
The krauts nuked New York City in 1942.
Wow, someone just blew up New York.
During World War II.
Think we can all guess who that someone is.
Nazis. I hate Nazis.
Aided by some sort of time traveling ally, obviously.
Wait, does that mean the Allied forces lost the war?
In which case, why aren't we speaking German right now?
Because we're in the temporal zone.
And because it takes time for the consequences of an aberration... even one as cataclysmic as this one, to ripple throughout time.
So how much time do we have to stop it?
Isn't traveling to that particular time precisely what Rex Tyler told us not to do?
Well, what's the alternative? We let New York blow up?
It's not like there are Time Masters left to stop it.
Miss Lance is right, we are history's last line of defense.
I like the sound of that.
I'd rather die than speak German.
[sighs]
Best case scenario, let's assume that Mr. Tyler is wrong and we all end up not dying in 1942.
What if, in endeavoring to save New York, we make things worse?
What could be worse than a genocidal fascist nuclear-armed super power?
Relax, Captain.
We got this.
Gideon, I need you to pull up everything you can on the target in 1942.
You are finally getting the hang of this whole revenge thing.
All right, so we know that he was alive during 1942, so we just need to know where he is.

Then I know where to find you. Thank you.
Miss Lance. Any luck pinpointing the epicenter of the temporal aberration?
No.
Oh, that's good news, even though we get nuked, we still win the war.
Look at the date, Dr. Palmer.
In this version of history World War II lasts two more years.
And claims 12 million more lives.
Including Albert Einstein.
Wait. W-wait.
Perhaps these two events aren't merely coincidental.
Think about it, a Nobel Prize winning physicist goes missing.
And miraculously, the Germans get the bomb three years ahead of us.
They must've kidnapped Einstein, forced him to build them an A-bomb, which means the only way for us to fix the aberration...
Is for us to kidnap him first.
Yes! Ha!
Gideon, please chart a course for New York City, 1942.
Oh, my God. [panting]
I can't believe I'm going to meet...
Albert Einstein.
I can't believe you're making me stay on the ship.
Mm. I'm asking you to stay on the ship, Mr. Jackson.
While the rest of you get to have all the fun battling Nazis.
You're the only one that I trust to give the time drive a long overdue tune up.
And build the time library and modify the bridge and half the other 100 things you've been getting me to do.
All right, give me your tools then.
What?
Pack up your tools and give 'em to me.
Why would I do that?
Well, I'm gonna give 'em to Mr. Rory to see if he wants to be the ship's mechanic.
You see, that's not funny.
Quite right, because in the event that we can't stop this nuclear explosion, a fully functioning time drive is going to come in handy.

So how do we find Einstein in a city of 7 million people?
Well, we just look for the physicist with the crazy white hair. I mean the other one.

Who, let me guess, had no one guarding her.
Yes, Einstein's collaborations with Ms. Maric were a closely guarded secret between the two of them.
A secret that the Germans apparently knew, so unless we can determine where they're keeping her while she manufactures their bomb...
