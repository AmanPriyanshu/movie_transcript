Mama? Mama, it's OK.
I just want to give you this. Look. Alright? Here.
I will get them back for what they did to us.

This book, it is bait!
You want the Master? He will come for whoever possesses it.
We want the

(Slurping)
Mom?
(Zack wheezing)
What did the Master offer you for it?
My son.
The
 will bring the Master out of hiding. When he comes for it, I'll kill him.
How do I know you can get the job done?
I've been preparing for this "job" for over 1000 years.
Alright, baby, you're doing great. Just breathe deeply.
In... out.
Enough with the breathing.
Oh, yeah, sure.
OK. Sounds good.
Look, Dr. Somani...
Dr. Somani?
Hi. So we are all set here.
Many, many first deliveries are long labors.
I wanted to do this naturally.
The fetus could go into distress. We've reached the time now where this is the right thing for everyone. Yeah?
So just lie back, try to relax, and this'll be over quickly.
Okay.
Isn't that what I said the night we got into this mess?
Here we go, OK?
I just wanted it to be perfect.
It is perfect. You're being too hard on yourself.
Suction, please?
(Squelching)
Thank you. There we go.
Get those hands in there. Yep.
(Gasping)
Oh!
What is it? Eph? Is it a boy? A girl?
What do we do?
Eph? What is it?
Hand under there, please.
What is it?
What's wrong with my baby?
It's within the caul.
Okay.
But everything's fine. Right, Dr. Somani?
Of course, it's just... it's incredible.
Get it out! Get my baby out of there!
Scalpel.
Scalpel.
Careful now. Gently, gently. Alright.
Alert the PICU. We might need them. Steady.
Steady. Get that head out.
Hand under there, please.
(Baby crying)
Everything's fine.
Alright. It'll be OK.
Beautiful baby boy.
Well done.
(Baby crying)
It was a great omen, Zack.
A caul baby is very rare.
You were delivered from my body but still part of me.
What do you mean?
We have a bond no one can break.
Even with you like this?
I'm sorry you saw me feeding, Zack.
I know it was a shock.
He was a boy.
I know.
But he was suffering in his old life.
It's like you. You're feeling better.
How is your breathing?
Better.
Really good, actually.
What did he give me?
A tiny droplet of what makes the Master special.
So does it mean that I'm going to turn?
The Master has seen this world through the centuries, Zack.
War. Strife. Starvation.
He wants to end all that.
And you can help him.
Yeah, but help him how?
He will show you when you are ready.
I always knew you were destined for great things.

Mr. Fet!
It's gone.
Gone?
My book. The

 is still a
The Born. He took it?
Could be handing it over to the Ancients right now.
Or even worse, the Master himself.
We must get it back!
Can't see any way to do that.
Unless someone who never trusted the Born to begin with slipped a tiny GPS tracking device, like the ones used to track wild animals, into the book's silver binding where no sticky-fingered muncher or half-muncher could ever find it.
Is that true?
Who's your favorite exterminator?
And in the name of all that's holy, let's go get the son of a bitch.
(Intense music)
(Distant men yelling)
_
(Footsteps)
Still agonizing?
Am I a fool?
Well, you're human.
It's a book.
Bound in silver, full of myth and folklore about
 throughout recorded history.
I... It's just a book. I know that.
Yes.
If the Master wants it that bad it must have some value to him.
Or he believes it does.
Exactly.
Am I trading the future of human life on Earth for the soul of my boy?
A parent's love for his or her offspring is one of the prime movers of human experience.
Or so you've been told.
Professor Setrakian informs me that your wife is one of the Master's principal servants.
What about it?
I believe there are other elemental human emotions at play here as well as a parent's love, such as hatred and revenge.
Don't shy away from the truth of what motivates you, Doctor.
That book is the answer to both our problems.
You will get your son back.
And I will kill my father.
(Hubbub)

(Laughing)
Oh, you're right!
(Man): Step up and see the demon child... the two-headed boy!
(Laughing and overlapping voices)
Are you afraid?
(Music playing)
... the horse I gave you.
Oh, yes.
(Overlapping voices)
Gaze upon unknown and mysterious creatures.
Behold the Leech.
(Snarling)
(Crowd murmuring)
It is a mute. The only thing this accursed being understands is a whipping.
(Growling)
I wouldn't get too close.
I want to watch him feed.

I am Ancharia.
I have been searching for you for a long time.

It's alright.
(Bleating)
(Screeching)
You are not unholy. You are blessed.
You are a prince born of a dark being.
But I must enquire, for what purpose do you desire to possess this abomination?
The truth, if you must know it, is that this being you call a "leech," and whom you have caged and whipped like a cur, is a hybrid creature.
Half-human, yes.
And half-strix.
A strix?
But he does not resemble a strix as I have seen them drawn.
They have black hair and curved fangs.
Oh, by Orcus's sword, what have I done?
Ask yourself, how much is it worth to you to remove its curse from your and your family's souls?
(Owl hooting)
Again. Your name?
(Stuttering)
Kuh... Quin...
Quintus.
Full sentence.
My... name... is...
Quintus.
So named because you are the fifth Invictus the unconquerable, the invincible.
Begotten of the Master, the seventh original strix.
It is too hard for you to understand now.
You bear the Master's mark, yes.
But not all who have horns are demons.
The desire you feel, your thirst.
It is your nature. Animal blood is not enough.
You must feed on the very species you were created to save. You must be strong.
The Master has surely been hunting you.
You will remain hidden here, with me, until such time as you are ready to fulfill the prophecy.
(Low growl)
You are exalted, Quintus.
A unique being destined for greatness.
For you alone can rid this world of his foul scourge.
You are the savior.
(Men yelling)
(Gunshots)
(Growling)
It's OK, Mama.
It's me, Gus. I just wanna give you something to eat, OK?

So help me out here.
The Master is not your biological father, of course, because 
 by their very nature, don't possess the proper equipment.
If that inquiry was meant to be a joke, I'm just as happy to ride in silence.
No, no, no, I'm dead serious.
I want to know how it works. Is it transduction?
The transfer of genetic material from one organism to the other by a viral agent.
I was conceived by two humans, just like yourself.
But at some point, my biological mother was stung by the Master.
Turned.
Infected.
There is a stricture in the lore about turning a pregnant woman.
The lore states the resulting creature would bear their mark, but not carry their plague.
And that this creature would be their undoing. At some point, the Master must have sensed the presence of a second heartbeat when he attacked my mother, but for some reason he was prevented from destroying her at that time.
So when your mother metamorphosed into a 
 the Master's infection changed you in utero.
An orphaned monster from the start.
OK, I think I understand that, but I still don't get how when he dies, you die.
All you need to know is that in me, the Master has sown the seed of his own destruction. It is my destiny. So, yes.
This is a suicide mission for me.
If the mythology is true.
It is true.
Three weeks ago you believed nothing. Do not presume to know what you will believe three weeks from now... if you're still alive.
Fair enough.

I got your goddamn book.
If you want it, you're gonna have to come through on your end. Here are the terms.
You will show up yourself.
Not your Nazi butler. You.
You will bring my son.
You will show him to me before I give you the book.
He will be unharmed. He will be human.
The exchange will occur just after sundown.
The location? A favorite fishing spot of Zack and mine.
He knows it. Not Kelly, no one else.
If you don't bring him...
I will know that he is dead or turned and you will never get the book.
Blink if you understand.

I know that you also thirst.
I am dying.

You will continue to waste.
And when the Master returns, you will be too weak to defend yourself.
Drink me, Quintus, and use me and your strength to escape.
Do not fight him.
There will be another opportunity to defeat him.
But not here.
Not now.
You must escape.
I won't do it.
The Master cannot love.
So he takes it from others, feeds upon it, along with their blood.
I don't know if you can feel love, Quintus.
But I can.
And I do.
I love you like a son.
Mother.
Please, my son.
I am suffering.

The majesty of residing underground like a snake.
A fugitive of nature.
Afraid of the sun.
Need I remind you; the night lasts as long as the day.
And I am doomed to stand astride both worlds... the light and the dark.
You cannot control me as you do your creatures.
It frustrates you, doesn't it?
To know you will never be my Master.

I will be if you drive faster!
You know, catching up to him is just like half the battle, right? The Born is kinda fast and kinda strong and invincible.
It's a good thing I brought these along.
Revenge has clouded the Born's mind.
An affliction with which I have personal experience.
But if that white-blooded b*st*rd costs me my best opportunity of defeating the Master, I...
I know where this is going!
Hey, what is this? Huh, what is it?

No fingerprints, no phone call?
Not no more. 10 out, 3 back?
Yep.

Hold on.
Sweep team? What's a sweep team?
We are at war.
We're not gonna have able-bodied men cooling their heels in a jail cell.
