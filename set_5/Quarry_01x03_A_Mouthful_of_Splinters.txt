: 
Yes?
Hey. I-it's Joni, right?
Yeah, I'm sorry. He never mentioned you.
I... I can tell him you came by.
"Never mentioned me"? All I did was save the guy's life, the ungrateful b*st*rd. (chuckles)
Is he home?
He's out at the moment.
And it's pretty late.
I'll be happy to tell him you came by.
 and I know two people in Memphis.
And one of 'em's dead. The other one's your husband.
Why didn't you call ahead?
Well, I... I did earlier.
It's just no one answered, you know?
Come on, Joni.
I gotta piss so bad I could fill a boot.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Ah, yeah. Whiskey if you got it.
(exhales)
Help yourself.
(door opens)
You want me to make you a sandwich?
There's gonna be a next time?
Aren't I a lucky gal?
I'll call you.
It's okay. Take it.
I do make a pretty mean sandwich, though.
(thumps)
(engine stops)
(door creaks)
(phone rings)
Hello?
: 
Who... who... who is this?
Yeah, I'm everywhere.
: 
: 
Yeah, trust me.
It's gonna count for a whole lot.
Where is she?
(Joni whimpering)
Say hi to your husband, sweetheart.
(Joni mumbling)
: 
Baby?
Baby, did he hurt you?
Did he hurt you?
Baby... Joni, listen to me, baby, the blood... the blood, did he hurt you?
: 
Oh, my God, do you understand what I'm gonna do to you?
No, do you f*ckin' understand what I'm gonna f*ckin' do to you?!
You're gonna do jackshit compared to what I'll do to her if you don't stop mouthin' the f*ck off!
: 
: 
And f*ck it, money while we're at it.
: 
: 
How much?
You got until 11:00 p.m. tomorrow.
(line clicks)
: 
Oh, well, if she cheats, you stop playing bridge with her, Mama.
It's that simple.
Oh, no, I ain't gonna stop playin' bridge with that woman. You know why?
She makes the best martini goin'.
Oh, good G... I've had her martini, Mama.
I'll show you how to make a better martini.
Well, your daddy made 'em best of all.
Mm.
Every night, toddy time.
Set your watch to it. Oh, man.
I miss that man's martini, I'll tell you.
Yeah, well, you're right about that.
You got, what, three cases of Beefeater in that closet over there.
You bet I do!
Well, you might as well put them to use.
I got an awful good deal.
(laughs) Yeah, sure, you did.
It has nothin' at all to do with that cute delivery boy.
Aw, it ain't that...
Muscles out to here...
Never mind.
...from carrying all that gin.
Calm down, now! You're gonna burst the stitches!
Hold yourself now. Stop it.
Ow!
Well, you keep shittin' and fallin' back in it, baby.
That's the price you gonna have to pay.
There we go. Perfect.
Thank you, Mama.
Hang on, now. It's the last part.
God!
What's the problem now?
Oh, it's nothing, Mama. I just got shot in my leg.
(chuckles)
The one I use for walkin'.
Probably get gangrenous and I'll die.
Oh, honey, our people don't die of gunshot wounds.
Our people die of alcoholism and heart disease.
Well, still hurts like all hell.
Okay.
Hold on, now.
What'd I do... oh, here.
This is left over from my hip operation.
You gonna take one every six hours, but you got to take it with food.
There's about five or six in there.
Oughta get you through a day or two, help you feel better, but I can always call Dr. Fred if you need more. Now hold on! What'd I say?
You got to take it 
I got some succotash and blood sausage all ready for you.
You just hold on a minute.
(exhales)
Thanks, Mama.
You want me to burn that sausage?
Yeah, burn it black.
I said burn it good.
I don't care. However it comes.

(cheering, applause)
: Okay, maybe... maybe the, uh... the client, you know, knows something.
You know, the one who hired you to kill Suggs.
: Client can't help us. Not with this.
Yeah, but, okay, they must know something more than we do.
You know what? Why don't you let me talk to them?
: That's not an option.
Okay, then. Fine, f*ck it.
I'm... I'm gonna...
I'll just go to the cops.

And tell 'em what, exactly?
I... I'ma tell 'em about Suggs and... (scoffs) okay, look, I'll tell 'em about you if I have to.
(chuckles) Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
That's certainly an option.
Wife of suspected war criminal whose former lover just died is now missing.
That's a head-scratcher.
Not to mention a man with a prosthetic leg being involved in both your friend's murder and your wife's abduction.
That should be easy to baby-step 'em through.
Mm.
Come on, Karl.
You said you were gonna take care of this.
You said you got this handled.
Afraid I was wrong about you, son.
Please, please.
Please.
I need your help.
See, now... that wasn't so hard, was it?
(voices murmuring)
Hey, there.
Tommy.
Yeah?
Sandy Williams.
(laughs)
Cliff's sister.
Holy sh1t, yeah, Sandy Williams.
Last time I saw you, you had a Barbie in each hand and a mouthful of metal.
How... how are you?
Uh, not too good, actually.
Yeah, I'm... very sorry.
Funeral arrangements are keepin' me busy.
Tryin' to keep myself movin'.
The worst is when I don't have anything to do.
And what brings you here today?
I don't know, actually.
Y'all called me.
(sighs) Will you give me a second?
Thanks.
Who called her?
: 
: 
Your friend was higher than elephant pussy when he got up under his car.
We're rulin' it an accident.
An accident already? Why?
Because it appears that it was a f*ckin' accident.
Bullshit. We haven't even taken a run at that Conway dirtbag yet.
We still can about the Solomon case.
The one where people were killed by bullets and guns and not by mixing substances with heavy machinery.
Landsdale says it was an accident, it was an accident.
'Less you got somethin' that proves otherwise...?
Let it go, Tommy.
Lieutenant, we can't close this case yet.
We can't close this case yet. We've been workin' on somethin'.
We got a connection.
Yeah, he told me.
Two dead people in Memphis knew the same woman.
Yeah, and that woman is married to a war criminal.
You got any idea what our numbers are this month?
This f*cking heat is making everybody so miserable, they're killin' each other.
We got no-shit homicides comin' in daily and we got all the makin's of a goddamn race riot over this busing bullshit.
Around here, there are only happy accidents.
Do you understand me?
Fine.
Lieutenant, at least let me be the one to tell her.
Always gotta win somethin', Olsen.
Hey, Sandy, can I get you a drink of water or anything?
Oh, no, I'm all right. Thanks for asking.
Hey, Miss Williams. We spoke on the phone.
I'm Detective Ratliff, Tommy's partner.
Of course, Detective.
So, any update?
Well, the toxicology report came back on Cliff.
I, uh...
Apparently, your brother had been drinking.
Also had marijuana in his system.
Very, uh, high levels.
Okay.
So... so what does that mean?
It means that they're rulin' it an accident.
Just didn't set the jack properly, maybe, but no sign of any foul play.
Okay.
So, I... I guess there's nothin' else that you need from me, then.
Do you have any questions for us, Sandy?
I'm not sure there are answers to the questions I have right now, Tommy.
I'm very sorry.
What do they say? "It's just... it's one of those things," I guess.
Well, when's the funeral?
This weekend. Are you comin'?
Yeah. I mean, I'll definitely try.
Well, thank y'all for your efforts.
Well, you hungry? Could go for a Huey Burger.
(faint pattering)
(phone rings)
Uh, h-hello?
: 
Yeah, who's this?
Uh, wh-who?
I'm investigatin' the murder of your friend, Arthur Solomon.
Mr. Conway, we need to set up a time for you to come on down here to the station so you and I can talk.
It's a serious matter.
Are you there, Mr. Conway...?
(handset slams)
(phone rings)
(rattling)
(faint shuffling)
(door closes)
You want some oysters?
Have one.
Come on, everybody loves oysters.
I'm not hungry.
(gasping)
You too f*ckin' good for oysters?
(choking) I'm... sorry.
I don't...
(gasps, coughs)
Fine.
Eat crackers, then, you picky bitch.
Sorry. That was uncalled for.
I get low blood sugar, I get irritable.
What are you...
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Let's see. Let me see your hand.
(panting)
That's a big cut.
Please...
A lot of letters you wrote.
You know, they say that cheatin's not about the other person.
It's about you and... your need for feelin' sexy or whatever. Being desired.
Still, I don't know why that dipshit husband of yours would go out for meat loaf when he's got this at home.
Hmm.
Well, he cheated on you.
Slings drinks at a strip club.
She's not a stripper, per se. Doesn't take her clothes off for money.
It's more like "has s*x with good tippers," I guess.
When?
I don't believe you.
Believe whatever you want. I don't give a sh1t.
But I had to know that you were there by your lonesome somehow.
So... he knew that black guy that got killed a couple weeks back?
They say a prosthetic leg was left at the scene.
What does Arthur have to do with this?
(faint tapping)
This land mine.
Dak To, '67.
(sniffs) Staff sergeant got the worst of it.
Split him asshole to helmet.
Nah, I'm just f*ckin' with you. It was diabetes.
You killed Arthur.
No.
No, that would have been 
 friend.
Whose throat your husband stuffed a sock in until he wasn't breathin' anymore.
You didn't know that part either.
Hey.
You have any idea who he'd have done that for?
And you don't know sh1t about sh1t.
You have no idea who your husband is.
(chuckles)
What to do, what to do?
(chuckles)
Please...
(gasps)
You reek.
You are a mouthy little c**t.
Married to a mouthy little dick.
You fit well together.
Mm-hmm, mm.
Please.
Okay.
I have my period.
(grunts) I told you at the house.
I have my period.
Come here.
No, no, no, no, no!
Shut up.
Please, please, please, please. Please...?
Shut up.
Stop!
Stop movin'.
You stupid whore.
Stop squirmin'!
Please stop.
Okay.
Get up.
(grunts)
(pants)
Can I have my purse? (sniffs)
My tampons are in my purse.
All right, I don't wanna f*ckin' hear about it.
(pounding on door) Hurry it the f*ck up.
Yeah, all right.
Get down.
Lean back.
Come on.
(gags)
There you go.
(motor chugging)
: 
Oh, yes, picture it... that straw hair and all.
Oh, God.
And then he starts yelling, "Naomi," he says, "you best not tell anybody about this."
I said, "Baby, I ain't gonna tell nobody you got a wooden dick if you don't tell nobody I got a mouth full of splinters."
(cackles)
You did not say that!
Yes, I did. It went on the whole afternoon.
Whole afternoon... pick, pick, pick, pick.
Oh, my God.
Damn. Yeah.
Oh, my God.
(chuckles)
Mm, mm, mm.
(sighs)
I miss these times with you.
I do.
Aw, I ain't complainin', it's just, you know, you're go, go, go all the time now.
Did I ever show you them pictures from me and your daddy's trip to New York City?
I ever show you?
Oh, no. I don't think you did.
Well, I'm gonna get 'em.
That was the first time your daddy ever rode in a plane.
Mama...?
(grunts)
What's the matter, honey?
Sweetheart, what's the matter with you?
I don't wanna do this anymore.
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
I thought you liked lookin' at the pictures.
No, Mama, not...
I'm not talkin' about that. I'm...
(sighs) I'm talkin' about the work I do.
Oh.
Oh, I see.
I just don't think I got it in me anymore.
I'm sorry, Mama, I don't mean to burden you with it.
What you mean, "burden" me? Don't ever say it again.
I just want my boy to be happy... my baby.
Well, how many years you been doin' this now?
Five, now. I don't know. I can't even remember anymore.
I imagine it does.
I'm glad you're speakin' on it.
(sobs) I just feel...
I feel like the inside of me is... it's worn away.
I'm gonna make you another. That's what I'ma do.
Well... (sniffles) as long as you don't short-pour the Beefeater this time.
Mama, it's shaker, ice, gin, tip your hat at the vermouth, and shake.
(chuckles)
Make yourself another while you're at it.
: ...and with the first week of school...
...the busing debate came out in force.
Because of a court ruling, changes could happen...
...or December. Proponents of the plan...
H-hello?
: 
Where are we meetin'?
I haven't touched her yet, but I sure have thought about it.
She reminds me of my mother a little bit, but in a sexy way.
I... I almost have your money.
I'm assumin' you'll be able to get the money within, uh, what, the next four and a half hours?
I'll have it.
You and your friend.
What did I do to you?
If I see that she's safe, I...
I'll tell you everything you wanna know. How's that?
Of course.
Don't keep us waiting.
(line clicks)
(boat horn blares)
Hey, Moses.
Best view of the city.
Great show last night.
Saw you talking up them girls.
Um-um, they were talking up me, my friend.
That right?
What can I say?
I'm just great company.
More like rich company.
I'll take what I can get.
So tell me, how's it comin' with our little girl?
She got her little kids.
They all cute.
Her sister help out. That's about it.
She sure as hell ain't got no $30,000.
You checked her house?
Watched her work her breakfast, lunch, dinner shift two days runnin'.
Not exactly the sign of a woman who's flush.
Maybe she's saving it for a rainy day.
Maybe she don't got it.
Look...
I need something that's gonna pay guaranteed.
Not this Easter egg hunt bullshit.
Not too many Easter eggs with $30,000 in 'em.
There's a man... white guy, 30, dark hair, mustache, stares at stuff a lot.
Name's Mac Conway.
Keep an eye out for him.
Like keep an eye out or "keep an eye out"?
What's the difference?
Well, one involves me being ready to be lethal with this white boy and one don't.
He's a friend of the dead husband.
And he knows about the money.
He workin' for you?
Just keep an eye out... the nonkilling one.
When you play next?
Tryin' to get some studio work down at the Fourge.
It's been a slow summer.
Look, this bitch got a little depressin' life and it's makin' me depressed to have to do this.
When can you throw me somethin' real?
You think you're ready for that after what happened?
I told you that...
 told you...
...ignorance still has consequences.
Sooner you find the money, sooner we can talk.
(knocking on door)
(footsteps approaching)
Can I interest you in the wonders of Tupperware?
This d... this doesn't look like $20,000.
Money's never as big as people think. It's all there.
All right. Look, here.
Okay, he called, okay?
He's at the King Cotton Hotel.
It's 11:00 p.m.
And... and I looked at it and regardless of what direction he comes in, okay, Mm-hmm. he's gotta come in from the north on Monroe.
Come in, yeah.
What?
(chuckles)
Nothing. It's just you're all fired up what with your plan and all.
Got a real sense of purpose...
Yeah, you're right.
I probably shouldn't be taking this very f*ckin' seriously.
You know, if my wife f*cked another man in my bed... if it was me, I'd probably let him have his merry way with her.
Hey, listen, bucko, okay?
This whole back-and-forth thing that we do, the banter, this ain't that, you understand me?
I do.
But if "Peg-Leg Pete" doesn't get his money, your wife vanishes off the face of the earth.
But not before he gives her the high hard one, 
You're under a lot of stress right now. I get it.
So here's a plan.
I'll show up and pop this guy after you've gotten your wife back.
How's that sound?
(taps table)
Oh, uh, the newspaper.
There's a lovely tribute 
You know, s*x... is such an intimate experience, isn't it?
Him staring into her eyes?
The sweat on her breasts.
(sighs)
Anyway, seems like he was pretty well-liked, so...
Thanks for the beer, Quarry.
It's always... always a pleasure.

Did he 
 Mac?
I'm just tryin' to check on you, Joni. That's all.
He didn't rape me.
At least... that part of my honor is still intact. Right?
I need to go to the house.
What?
I need to get my stuff.
No, absolutely not. Out of the question.
Mac, I need to get my stuff, all right?
And then, believe me, I never wanna step foot in that f*ckin' house again.
Okay, what are you sayin', Joni?
I don't know what I'm saying! I'm just... except... there's a f*cking maniac out there somewhere...
Exactly!
That's why going back to the house for anything whatsoever is a bad f*ckin' idea!
Don't you f*ckin' yell at me!
Look, we'll just stop somewhere.
I'm takin' care of this, okay?
I will find him.
Take care of who?
We're gonna get...
Who are you?!
...find stuff for you, and then we'll go back tomorrow when it's daylight.
I'm gonna get my stuff.
You're gonna what, stash me somewhere?
You won't let me call the cops.
Okay, I told you, Joni, I'ma take care of it, okay?
You just have to give me a little more time...
I'm gonna get my stuff, Mac!
Just let me get my stuff, okay, please?
Why won't you just...

Depends.

How fast and far I can drive.
The boss is gonna wanna know where you are, Quarry.
You just tell him to find this one-legged f*ck.
Okay?
What do I... what do I tell her?
Whatever you'd like.
Probably best to steer clear of the truth, though.
For her sake.
Hazard pay.
And, uh...
(exhales)
Thank you, Karl.
You are, oh, so welcome, Quarry.
Drive carefully.
Who was that?
It doesn't matter, okay? I'll explain later.
Get in the car. We need to get outta here.
What about... what about our car?
Joni, please. Get in the car.
