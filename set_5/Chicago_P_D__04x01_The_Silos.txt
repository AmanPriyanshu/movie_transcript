♪ Happy birthday, dear Daniel ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
So you were in town last month.
Yeah, I was seeing a friend.
So who's this friend?
[tires squealing]
Hank...
Justin!
[whispering] You did good.
[gunshot]
[screams]
[shrieking]
I'm Justin's dad.
Start digging.
Please, Justin wouldn't want you to do this.
Erin, get out of here... now.
I'm gonna tell you what I told him right before I put a bullet in his head.
[crying]
[gasps]
What happened?
Nothing.
You okay?
Yeah.
I got to go.
Detective.
On the night the intelligence unit was pursuing Justin Voight's killer, I was monitoring the team's radio transmissions and geographical locations.
I had your cell phone and Sergeant Voight's triangulated the second radio traffic stopped.
The two of you were both right here at the Silos while the rest of the team was pinged clear across the city.
That's right.
We were here.
This is a place that Sergeant Voight comes to gather his thoughts.
And he was reeling after you pulled him off the case, so when I couldn't get him on his cell or the radio, I came here.
And did what?
Talked... about his unimaginable grief over losing Justin.
It was a cop's son that was killed that night, Commander.
I don't know if anyone briefed you on that.
So you agree with what he did?
I don't know what you're referring to.
You pulled us off the case.
We complied.
As far as we know, Justin's killer's still out there somewhere.
How much longer are you gonna cover for Voight, at the expense of your own career and this entire department's reputation?
Does that matter to you?
Or have you been fully absorbed into his world?
I know you're indebted to him.
He pulled you off the streets when you were 15.
But it's time for you to think for yourself.

[rescue radio chatter]
Arson?
No doubt.
Strong smell of gasoline, but no ruptured fuel lines or tanks.
This was definitely a pour.
Victim was probably dead beforehand, otherwise he would've tried like hell to crawl out of there.
Man, what a way to go.
Yeah.
We have guys checking the security cameras over by the containers.
Keep me posted.
Copy that.
Hank.
I heard about your son.
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I am.
That means a lot, Matt.
Yo, Sarge.
Plates came back to a Ted Berner.
55, no priors.
All right, thanks.
Hey, how'd it go?
Not great.
Hey, check this out.
What?
Right here.
What's that on his chest?
Is that a police wire?
Well, let's find out.
Hey, is that my car?
Whoa! Who are you?
Is that my car?
Uh... Ted Berner.
Was it stolen?
No, my son Evan borrowed it.
I hadn't heard from him, so I located his phone on the app.
Is... is Evan here?
Mr. Berner, there's an adult in the front seat, but we haven't identified him.
[panting]
Evan wears my father's, um, watch on his right wrist...
An old Omega.
Is it him?
No. No, please...
Please.
Please... please.
Did he owe anyone money?
No, he moved back home to save cash.
He was gonna do a semester in England next year.
Mr. Berner, your son may have been wearing a wire...
Like a police recording device.
Does that make any sense to you?
What? No.
None.
Okay.
All right, we'll get you home now, Mr. Berner.
You read about all these murders on the South Side, but living in Edgebrook, you think you're safe.
I can't believe this is happening.
He was...
[crying softly]
Coming back to work so soon?
Yeah.
I need this.
How's your grandson?
[laughs] Yeah, well... thank God for him.
That's the only blessing in this whole thing.
He's too young to figure it out, because...
I can't imagine telling an eight-year-old.
Yeah.
You need anything else...
Anything else you want to talk about?
There seems to be something on your mind.
No.
Okay, then.
Sergeant, hey.
Hey, Burgess, didn't see you there.
So I'm getting a new partner today?
Yes, indeedy.
'Cause the thing is, I heard she came from the foot beat at 26th and Cal.
Correct.
Which is the worst job in the city.
Where is this going, Officer?
I just want to know what she did to get stuck there.
She a dog-ass cop or what?
Because with everything that's going on around here, I need somebody that I can trust.
Okay, look, this is the deal.
But you got to keep it under your hat, okay?
Oh, of course.
And there she is.
Julie Tay?
Hi.
Meet your new partner, Kim Burgess.
Hi, nice to meet you, Kim.
Oh, yeah.
I've heard a lot of good things about you.
You too. I'm just, uh, wow.
I'm really looking forward to working with you.
Me too.
Hey.
Stay alive out there.
Okay?
Hmm.
"The Five People You Meet in Heaven."
He's got this underlined:
"The only time we waste is the time we spend thinking we're alone."
This is my daughter, Ally.
We're very sorry about your brother.
Ally, is there anything that you could tell us that might help?
Anything that he may have been into?
Nope.
Do you know if he was working with the police or any other law enforcement?
Why do you say that?
Well, we think that he may have been wearing a wire that the police use.
CPD is so crooked, it's unbelievable.
Ally.
I mean, why are you asking us this stuff?
Shouldn't you know?
[sighs heavily]
She, um...
No need to explain.
Totally understandable, and she makes a good point.
Now if we have to come back and ask any more questions, we'll make sure we have all our ducks in a row first.
So I hear 21st is getting body cams soon.
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah.
They're starting to roll them out through the districts.
I personally think it's a good idea, 'cause, you know, it protects us as much as the public.
So where you coming from?
Foot beat. 26th and Cal.
The courthouse?
Yeah.
Isn't that the worst job in the city?
Writing parking tickets to cops that are just there to testify?
Yeah, yeah.
It sucked... completely.
Yeah, so how did you end up there?
Basically...
We have a person calling for help at 115 West Pershing.
Dispatch, hold us down on that call.
We're two blocks out.
[siren wails]
Down there! I don't know where!
What's down there?
Screaming!
I heard a woman screaming!
All right, you stay right there.
[muffled scream]
Tay, black SUV!
Help!
Chicago PD... open up!
[indistinct shouting]
Gun!
Get out of the car!
[glass shatters] Put your weapon down!
[tires squealing]
Stop the car!
Stop the car!
Ah!
Hey!
Tay!
Tay, are you okay?
Hey, hey, hey, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Let's go.
2113 Squad. We're mobile.
Vehicle just spotted westbound 300 west block of Root.
We're in pursuit, turning south.
Black SUV, no plates.
Suspect is armed. Right there!
There she is! Right there.
[whimpering]
Ma'am, don't move. Don't move.
We're here to help you.
Hey, hey, hey.
Who was that man who was hurting you?
I don't know.
I called an Uber, and he pulled up and said the car that I called got put on another job.
Hey, hey. What's your name?
Tell me your name.
Kate.
Kate.
He threw me out of the car.
It's gonna be okay.
[crying] Thank you for saving me.
It's okay.
[sirens approaching]
[woman continues sobbing]
Got incoming.
It's all right, sweetie, we got you.
We got you. It's okay.
We're staying right here with you, okay?
We're going to Trauma 2.
All right, Burgess, what happened?
Kate Chen, hit repeatedly, choked out, lost consciousness twice... that she remembers...
And sexually assaulted.
All right, we got this.
[sighs]
[cell phone buzzing]
Her Uber driver wasn't pulled off to another job.
Offender probably saw her waiting for a ride and just bluffed her into his car.
You know, the temporary tags on the SUV...
They weren't Illinois tags.
Those were yellow placards, and they usually go on the rear bumper, which means the car was purchased out of state or at an auction.
Right.
Maybe something to go on.
Yeah. Tay.
You sure you're okay?
Yeah, thanks.
2113 Squad...
[exhales sharply] Hey.
How's everything going?
Good.
You can talk to me about anything.
You know that, right?
Yeah, I do.
Thanks.
Okay... where we at with the wire this DOA was wearing?
Tech lab confirmed that it is CPD-issued.
And no one's stepped forward to say they're working with this kid?
No, no one yet.
I want a full work-up on the DOA's sister, Ally.
Something was up with her at the house.
I agree.
Okay, I'm on it.
[cell phone buzzing]
Okay, Ally Berner.
Uh, looks like an Officer Ricci out of Narcotics brought her in two weeks ago, but there's no record of any arrest.
Must've been a catch-and-release.
All right, let's get Ricci on the phone.
I'm on it.
I'm stepping out for a bit.
Keep me posted.
Hang on. Sarge.
Commander Crowley's on the 7447 line for you, sir.
Take a message.
Okay, thanks.
Thank you.
All right, Ricci's out on a buy with her team, so she's not gonna come up for air until this afternoon.
All right, let's take a ride.
You know, that's the third time that she's called for him today.
Everybody just do your jobs, all right?
Hey, I'm sorry to have to come back like this.
No, you're not.
Ally, we're sensing a little hostility between you and the Chicago Police Department.
What do you guys want?
Well, we're wondering if maybe that has something to do with you and Officer Ricci from Narcotics.
'Cause the only thing we know for sure is that your brother was wearing a CPD wire, and you were brought in two weeks ago by Ricci.
Then why aren't you talking to her?
We will.
But I have a feeling that we'll get the most... truthful version from you.
Ally, help us find who killed your brother.
It's all right. It's okay.
I don't know.
But, um, Officer Ricci... She arrested me for possession.
I had some molly.
I went to a concert, and I got it from a friend.
She told me that because I was within 1,000 feet of a school, it was a Class X felony, and I was gonna get ten years.
She said that the only way that I could avoid doing jail time was if I did a buy from a dealer she was trying to bust.
I freaked. I didn't know what to do.
So I told Evan, because we're close.
He said that he would do it for me so I could stay out of it.
He talked to Officer Ricci, and she said...
She said that she didn't care who did it, but if it didn't get done, I was going to jail.
And the next thing I heard, he was found burned to death in that car.
Man.
That's why I didn't come forward sooner.
I don't know who I can trust.
Officer Ricci?
Yeah?
Detectives Halstead and Lindsay.
Intelligence.
Evan Berner.
What about him?
You tell us.
Uh, he was working a case for me.
He got cold feet; he took off.
He was found torched in his car yesterday.
Are you messing with me right now?
No.
You have anybody in custody?
No, we don't.
Oh, my God.
Uh, we went on a buy.
Evan went mobile with the target, which he wasn't supposed to do, but I just figured he boogied.
Happens all the time. You guys know that.
Tried calling him couple times.
No dice, so I was just waiting for him to come forward.
I think you're lying to cover your ass.
What?
Huh.
Who the hell are you to talk to me like that?
You let his sister think she was looking at ten years and a felony charge on a dime bag.
And you let Evan step into her shoes.
I'm gonna talk to you however the hell I want to talk to you.
You flip the minnows to get to the sharks.
Do you even know how Narcotics works?
Actually, I do.
Yeah?
So where's your pre-raid plan? I'd like to see it.
And I'd like to know who was on your team.
Uh, my team got called into court at the last minute.
That's why it was just me and Mike Kendricks, my partner.
Interesting. What about the 1505 buy money?
Where is it? Who signed it out?
And who wired Evan up? They did a crap job.
All right. All right.
Okay, okay.
Let's, uh... start over, okay?
We're all on the same team here, right?
Maybe I cut a couple corners, okay?
Look, I'm just trying to get my arrest and my activity rate up, okay?
Who was the target? Let's start there.
Connor Wix.
He's a big MDMA dealer.
Ex-Marine. Owns a gym in Bucktown.
He's a piece of work, this guy.
And this is who got into Evan's car before you lost him?
Yeah, that's right.
Okay.
You know, I'll bet you knew Evan got killed yesterday, and you were just hoping no one connected the dots back to you.
You work for Hank Voight in Intelligence, and you're lecturing me?
Save it.
Olive?
[baby babbling]
Hey.
You going somewhere?
[chuckles]
To Scottsdale, where my sister is.
For how long?
I'm moving there, Hank.
Olive...
There's too many bad memories around here.
Everywhere I look, I either see Justin, or I see what killed him.
Olive, please don't do this...
Not right now.
Just, please...
I can't stay here.
I'm sorry.
[car horn honking]
That's my ride.
[baby crying]
Shh, shh, shh.
[baby wailing]
Hey, I tried you last night.
Yeah.
I feel a little, um...
Handcuffed here, because I want to be there for you.
But I don't know what you're going through.
Crowley thinks I know about Voight and that guy who killed Justin.
Do you?
I know enough.
Now every step I take, I feel like it could be a trapdoor.
Those are meant for Voight.
Do not go down with him, please.
It's already in motion.
I just got to let it play out.
Hey, there's one thing you can do.
Move in with me.
Cases come and go.
Bosses come and go. Jobs come and go.
I don't want you to come and go.
Is this Wix?
Yeah, that's him.
[camera shutter clicks]
Cigarette super set I guess, huh?
[camera shutter clicking]
Mm-hmm.
Triggerfish him.
I want that number.
Okay.
Come on, call somebody, you nitwit.
Hey, Antonio, headquarters called me, asked me to come in and talk about the night Justin Voight got killed.
Have your FOP lawyer handle it.
Handle it?
I mean, there's nothing to handle.
I don't... I don't know anything.
Well, good.
Either way, you don't talk to them unless your lawyer's present.
Okay.
But if I bring in a lawyer, doesn't that look like I'm guilty of something?
You asking me for my advice or just to let me know headquarters reached out to you?
Advice.
Then let your FOP lawyer handle it, and let's not talk about it again.
I can do that.
[camera shutter clicking]
All right, here we go.
[device beeps]
All right.
We got it.
Call that number in to Lindsay.
We need warrant for all the the muds and tolls off that phone.
Yup.
Hey, Hank.
Yeah?
Father of the DOA, Ted Berner.
He just got here. He's got some questions.
You know, you could've taken longer to come back.
A lot of things I could've done different, Trudy.
Mr. Berner?
So... [sniffs]
I'm hearing from my daughter that a cop may have pushed Evan into this?
We're looking into that.
Yes or no?
Yes.
I tried calling her... Ricci?
That's her name?
She won't call me back.
Now's not the right time.
She got my son killed!
I understand what you're feeling right now.
You don't understand a damn thing I'm feeling right now!
Mr. Berner, do you want an investigation as to what went wrong, or do you want to find the man who killed your son?
[breathing heavily]
I want to find the man that killed my son.
I'm gonna do that.
Right now, everyone involved in this case needs to keep a real low profile.
You got to trust me on this.
[crying softly]
[sniffles]
They took 60 years of living away from him.
Falling in love, getting married, holding his child in his arms...
[sniffles]
Any updates?
No, but they've got an all-call message going every half hour over the zone.
The offender's still out there. Car's not been recovered.
Last time I fired my service weapon, I got dragged into court.
Almost lost my job.
I maybe hesitated a little back on the street.
I may have had the shot on that guy.
That won't happen again.
Everything was happening so fast.
And there was a civilian there, so you made the right call not to fire.
I'm glad you're my partner.
Me too.
[chuckles]
Pfff.
We'll just see how long it lasts.
How do you mean?
Two years ago, I was working at the 24th.
Okay.
And there was... is... a Commander Fogel.
I ran into him at a bar after hours.
He seemed very nice. Walked me to my car.
And then he tried to kiss me.
I pushed him off. Didn't report him.
I should've, because the next day, he put a brick on me, and that's how I ended up writing tickets at 26th and Cal.
He assigned you there?
Yeah.
And then I met Sergeant Platt at a Women's Police Association lunch, and she offered to help me out.
What?
There was a decal on the back window of the SUV...
A White Sox parking sticker, for residents living near the ballpark.
I think that can help us narrow down where the SUV came from.
All right, according to the phone records, Wix had these four women working for him...
Probably his couriers.
Three of them are strippers, for whatever that's worth, but one of 'em stood out...
Nikki Culler.
Looks like she did some smurfing for Wix.
Hit multiple currency exchanges, but kept everything under 3K so as not to elicit a Suspicious Activity Report.
The thing is, she did it so many times, she got reported anyway.
Where's Lindsay?
She's working the case.
Ah, here we go.
Wix and Nikki have a three-year-old son together.
Child Services has been to their apartment three times over the past two years.
Where's Ryder?
With a police officer in...
What?
Ryder? Come here, sweetie.
Mommy.
Hey. Hey.
[exhales]
He's a cute kid.
You ever want to see him again?
So these are copies of what I submitted to the Ivory Tower.
My NPR and a To-From to my commander and a closing report.
It lays out what I did...
And what I didn't do.
And it's not just to cover my ass.
I just feel responsible for what happened to Evan Berner.
I can't make it right, but I can face up to it.
Good luck, Officer.
Sometimes you get caught up in the job, and you forget the real reasons why you started doing it to begin with.
Okay, so we're looking for a nexus between out-of-state temp tags and White Sox residential parking stickers.
Yeah, also check for any registered s*x offenders in that district and the surrounding districts.
Okay.
Hey, turns out writing all those parking tickets at the courthouse finally paid off.
[chuckles] Yeah, let's hope.
Look for body shops in the neighborhood.
If the offender's from there, he's gonna be looking to get the windows fixed.
Oh. Girl's still got it. [laughs]
Wow.
Officers.
How's it going?
Your name?
Oscar Flynn.
You the owner?
That's right.
Okay, we're looking for a black SUV...
Out-of-state temp tags.
Would've come in in the last day or so to get his window fixed.
I've seen him.
When?
Came in earlier today.
I told him I couldn't get it done till tomorrow.
He offered me double, and I told him he could offer me quadruple, but I wasn't gonna get the parts here till tomorrow.
Sent him to Pinky's over on Roosevelt.
He took off.
You got security cameras out here?
Only out back.
Kim.
Put your hands on the hood.
Whose car is that?
You say nothing, it's yours, and then you go down for kidnapping and rape.
You like that? Give me a name.
Police! Freeze!
I will not hesitate!
[grunts]
I just feel like I'm being worked here.
You're shacking up with a drug dealer who killed someone.
You're totally aware what he does for a living, right?
And you've helped him launder money.
I don't know everything.
I didn't know that he killed that kid.
Exactly, and that's the only thing that's gonna keep you out of jail and with your son.
But you got to help us bring Wix down...
Period.
[sighs]
Okay, so located on your purse strap is a tiny, undetectable camera.
We can see everything.
Okay.
Right in here is the transponder.
You don't need to do anything.
Just keep that in your purse.
I don't need to activate it or anything?
One more time: you don't need to do anything.
Detective Olinsky's your ghost.
He'll be nearby with an eye on you at all times ready to move in if needed.
Do not make eye contact with him.
Well, how close?
I'll be close enough. Don't worry.
Look, if you're afraid for any reason, take off your ponytail holder.
That's your visual distress signal, okay?
Your verbal cue is "crazy."
That's all you got to say...
Like, "Hey, this is crazy," all right?
One of those cues or both, we're coming in.
I... I wouldn't say, "This is crazy."
I would say, "This is bananas."
Okay, "bananas." That's all right.
Everybody hear that? New safe word.
It's bananas.
I'm freaking out a little bit here, okay?
Hey, hey, hey. This is what we do.
And we do it better than anybody.
If anything looks like it's going sideways, we'll move in.
There's nothing in this world worth you getting hurt over.
We have your back.
He doesn't.
Your boyfriend shot a kid in the head and then lit him on fire.
Sorry if I'm not in a hand-holding mood right now.
I had nothing to do with that!
You're gonna be fine, Nikki.
Just stick to the plan.
Let's roll out.
Why you calling me on my personal phone?
I saw the news, Connor.
Good for you.
I never agreed to this.
To what?
Burned alive?
If it makes any difference, Nikki, he was dead before the car was torched.
You're sick.
He was a snitch working with the cops.
[cell phone buzzing]
_
That's what he said?
No.
"I'm working with the cops."
That's what he said?
It was a hunch I got, and I pressed him on it, and he didn't have the right answers.
He made his choice. I made mine.
Okay?
So you killed him?
Why are you asking so many questions?
Bitch!
Move in.
[tires screech]
[engine revving]
Got him.
Don't move!
Commander.
Would you come with us, Sergeant?
Your gun, please.
At this point, we have a pretty good idea what happened the night your son was killed.
Is that right?
Your brought the suspect, Kevin Bingham, here... and he never left.
We pinged your car to this location.
Look familiar?
Hank, you know how this works.
Save us the trouble of having to dig up his body, and we cut you a deal.
You got a kid, Commander?
No?
Well, if you did, and you held him in your arms with blood coming out of his head from a gunshot wound, we wouldn't be standing here right now.
Dig it up.
You have to make so many death notifications on this job.
I remember every one.
Now to be able to walk up to someone's door, someone who's lost so much, and bring good news...
It's a blessing.
I hear you.
Kate?
Are any of these men the person that did this to you?
That's him.
Are you going to arrest him now?
We already got his ass.
[cries]
Thank you.
Of course.
Thank you.
[low conversation]
Commander.
Commander.
Heard you were detailed at the 21st.
That's correct.
Good luck.
Tay?
Congratulations.
Can I get back to work now?
He's cleared.
[buzzing]
[knocking at door]
Thank you.
You saved my life.
I would've been dead at 15 if you hadn't taken me in.
There's... no doubt in my mind about that.
And I've always looked forward to saving yours.
You're all I have left now.
