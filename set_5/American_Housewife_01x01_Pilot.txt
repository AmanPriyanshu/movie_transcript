Mom, I've thought about it, and I refuse to participate in the school food drive on principle.
And what principle is that?
Westport homeless people have better stuff than we do.
Nude Norman rides a bike that's worth more than our car.
And when he does wear clothes, they're Ms. Halloran's cashmere hand-me-downs.
It's a little thing called charity, Oliver.
It's the worst thing for him.
Nude Norman isn't gonna get a job if it's open season on free cans of creamed corn.

Hey, my mother never talked to me about any of this stuff.
I spent half of sixth grade with a sweat sock in my underpants convinced I was dying.
Would now be a good time to ask for a pet owl?
I don't know if there's ever a good time for that.

Pam just put her house on the market.
Fat Pam? Rich Fat Pam?
She's moving to Vermont.
And I'm going to be the second-fattest housewife in Westport.
Mnh. Not possible.
No way.
Okay, there's Evelyn. The biggest.
Thank God for Evelyn.
Yeah.

Oh, my God.

There's nothing wrong with you.
You're beautiful and amazing.

What the hell is that woman over there wearing?
Is that a Fitbit?
Uh, yeah. That's a Fitbit.
But she's wearing two of them.
Yeah, she is. One on each wrist.
I literally cannot conceive of a reason why a person would need to wear two Fitbits.
When did it become okay for women our age to do nothing but diet and work out?
It's all those damn fools do.
It's completely absurd and a total waste of feminine energy.
I object to it deeply and on every level.
On every level.
Do you know what you are, Katie?
You're a revolutionary.
Mm-hmm.
Half the women in this country are over a size 14, and they're made to feel bad about themselves.
Who came up with the idea that a mother of three should have an ass like a 19-year-old?
Oh, you have a great ass, Katie.
Like a couple of ripe cantaloupes in your pants.
Thank you. I know.
I'll tell you one thing...
I'm not going on some stupid diet.
Greg pretty much wants to have s*x with me all the time anyway.
I'm not really interested in giving him any added incentives.

Uh-huh.
You have to sit next to me while I watch "Castle" and let me talk about Nathan Fillion's hair.

Taylor, tell your brother how well you did with the food drive last year.
I did very well.
I don't believe in giving hand-outs.
This constant doling out of freebies violates my principles, and it's tearing this country apart.
I don't like it, Mom. I don't like it one bit.
They told me to stop eating soft cheeses while I was pregnant with you, but I didn't listen.
And this is what happens.
I think that's a weird thing to say to a child.
Listen to me, Oliver.
Bring in some damn cans of food for the food drive tomorrow, and that is a direct order.
Okay, fine.
But shouldn't you be focusing on your kids who needs focusing?
How's school, Anna-Kat?
Well, I don't have any friends.
Of course you have friends, sweetie.
Today it was because I wouldn't hold hands in partner tag.
Why didn't you hold hands in partner tag?
Because I don't want to catch people's invisible germs.

That's how you get sick.
That is not how you get sick.
Pretty sure it is.
Right.
Germs are made up.
Everyone's crazy.
So...
I came up with a few ways to stop Fat Pam from leaving town.
If she can't sell her house, she can't move, right?
Oh, this can't miss.
Number 1... remove three tires from car and park on lawn.
Next.
Take in Urban Youth or people who just seem terrorist-y.
[Quietly] No.
We become "The end is near" people.
You know those people, "End is near!"
I'm not gonna do that.
Two words... tampon wind chime.
Okay.
Put two hogs in yard.
Did you actually write that on the paper?
Mm-hmm. And I put a star next to it.
Greg.
I know you think that I'm acting crazy, but there's Evelyn, there's Pam, and then there's me.
With Pam gone, I move up a notch.
And it's like stepping into a really bright spotlight.
And it's making me feel really bad about something that I don't already feel great about in the first place... being fat.
Oh, sweetie.
This is the part where you say I'm not fat.
You're not fat.

Oh, my God. It's Two Fitbits.

Well, just go over there and convince her not to buy this house.
