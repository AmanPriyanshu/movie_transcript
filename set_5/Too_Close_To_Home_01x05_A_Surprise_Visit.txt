: You got 24 hours to get me my package or Bonnie, Shelby gonna be killed.
I told you I'll get the money.
: 
Allegedly she was having an affair with President Christian.
: Have you heard the news?
You know what, you're high and I want you to get out.
That's Rick's truck. Give me your keys right now.
No, I ain't giving you nothing.
Give me your keys or I'm calling the sheriff!
Where is Malone, Shelby?!
What the hell kind of sister are you?
The type that doesn't sleep with her sister's boyfriend.
You think that you're just going to go?
Move.
He likes to control me.
So I understand your situation.
I think I left my phone in there.
You don't mind opening it up for me?
What are you doing?
[Gasps]
Hey, Bonnie, where are you?
You should have been here by now. Give me a call.
[Coughing]
You okay?
[Coughing]
Hey, hey.
Why did you do that?
You awake?
Yeah.
Good, that's good.
Please don't hurt me.
Okay.
The money's in the register.
You can have it all.
How much?
$420.
Is that what you think this is about... $420?
[Crying] I don't know. Why are you here?
You... you're a sweet girl.
I'm not robbing you.
I don't want that either.
You wanna know what I'm doing?
Yeah.
I'm sending a warning.
A warning, I don't...
A warning to your man.
My man?
Yeah, I think you call him J.B.
He took a lot from me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know J.B., right?
Yeah. Yes!
You know what he's been up to?
No.
I don't.
You got a sister?
[Chuckles] It's okay to answer.
I'm... I'm not going to hurt 'em...
I don't think.
Do you have a sister?
No.
No?
You don't have a sister named Shelby?
[Laughs]
You're bustin' my ass.
You really are a sweet girl, you know that?
I
 you have a sister.
And your man has been taking a lot from me.
And he's got about 18 hours to give me back what I'm owed!
Or it's going to be you and them and the coroner.
Oh, no.
Please, please, please, please, please don't.
No.
He's dead.
♪ Movin' down that highway ♪

♪ Alabama bound ♪

♪ got to get out of D.C. ♪

♪ Live in my small town ♪

♪ I've been wrong ♪

♪ trouble has hit me ♪

♪ too close to home ♪
He's dead.
No, please he has children, okay?
Look at me, I'm not going to tell anyone.
Tell anyone about what?
Talk about nothing, nothing.
Please.
You really do care about people?
I do.
I see.
Please.
Okay.
If you screw anything up, you're both dead.
Okay, I won't.
Bonnie?
Hey, Sheriff.
Hey, howdy.
Howdy.
I remember you. I saw you here before.
What's your name?
He's just leaving, Sheriff.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
What's going on here?
I was just sad about Anna, and he talking to me about it.
Is she all right?
I don't know.
I haven't heard from her.
So you know Anna?
No, he didn't know her, but he... he was just listening.
I see.
That's real nice.
Yeah, that's real nice.
So, what's your name?
Marty.
You got a last name?
Take care, Marty. See you soon.
You sure?
Absolutely.
Take care.
Still didn't get your last name.
Doe.
Doe?
Yeah.
As in John Doe?
As in Marty Doe.
Well, Marty Doe, where you from?
Take care, Marty.
Bonnie.
Sheriff?
Yeah.
Sheriff?
Yeah.
Have you seen Shelby?
No, I'm sorry I was late.
See Rick's car out there, so obviously she's not driving.
No, I got her keys, so...
Good.
[Engine starts]
Who is that guy?
Hey, what took you so long when I called?
Oh, Mrs. Pemrose had me dealing with her cats.
[Chuckles] Woman's got 50 cats now.
She needs to be committed.
[Vehicle departs]
Who was that guy?
Just a customer.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Any idea where's he from?
I don't.
He looks like bad news, Bonnie.
You think so?
Yeah.
Hmm.
You be careful when he's around, all right?
I will.
Okay.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
All right.
Damn.
Yeah, I know. [Sighs]
There's nothing here.
Yep, this is... this is Happy, Alabama.
It don't look too happy if you ask me.
Mm-hmm, yeah, it's not.
Looks like cow manure.
[Laughs] Yeah.
It smells like it too.
Yeah, that's why you left, right?
Yeah. Yeah.
This, you know, got out of here and I never looked back.
Wow.
Ain't gonna have anyone coming over here looking for you.
That's for sure.
Oh, wow, is that a bar?
You don't wanna go there.
You don't. Promise me you won't go in there.
Why? Why not?
This... [Sighs] this town is not really fond of outsiders.
What does that mean?
I'm just saying that, you know, just skinny jeans and perfectly styled hair doesn't really blend in here, that's all.
You trying to say that my clothes make a statement about me? Is that what you're saying?
No.
Oh.
I'm just saying that you're pretty.
And pretty does not work in this town.
Well, thank you.
You're welcome.
Yeah, I can... I can see that.
So, uh, I guess that hotel is the only one around in town, huh?
Yep, that's it.
All right, well, I guess I can check in unless I can stay with your family.
I don't... I don't think that's a very good idea.
Why?
Because I...
I just I haven't seen them in...
A very... long time.
And I just don't think...
Oh. Okay.
No, no, that's... that's okay.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
Okay, thank you.
So, I guess I'll drop you off and...
I'll head on over to the fabulous Peppermill Inn!
[Laughs]
Yeehaw! Howdy.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Okay.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Yeah, I'm gonna need it.
[Chuckling] That's for sure.
I'm sorry.
:
We don't know yet.
All we know is that Ms. Hayes was the last person... 
Mac!
What?
Come see this.
We have been told that she was a frequent visitor with the president.
Look!
What are they saying? 
You can't say mistress... 
That she did something to the president.
Well, that's the thing. Nobody really knows the background of Ms. Hayes.
[Dog barks in distance]
Hey.
Hey.
I was worried about you.
I'm fine.
I was about to come looking for you.
I'm sorry.
Where you been?
It just took a little bit late to close up, last customer.
Okay. You come on in.
No, I got to go home.
Come on in.
No, I got to go, Brody. I'll see you tomorrow.
No, Bonnie, come on in.
I can't.
Bonnie, you're upset.
Well, about what?
About me calling Anna.
No, I'm not. I told you we're not together.
Brody, you can do whatever you wa...
I
 do that.
Look, I'm not sorry.
I have to go.
Bonnie!
What?
Can we at least talk about my daddy?
Yes, of course.
Where is he?
He's asleep.
How we gonna do this?
I'll come and sit with him on my days off, and some nights you can go work.
Okay?
Okay.
That would help a great deal.
Okay. I'll see you later.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Bonnie, you're upset.
Brody!
It's J.B., isn't it?
No!
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
No, it's something.
You listen to me right now.
If we're gonna do this, then we have to keep it what it is.
And that is me taking care of your daddy in exchange for Mama's rent.
Okay?
Okay.
And that's it.
Yeah, fine.
Fine, I won't cross any lines.
You just did.
Look I can't help that, Bonnie.
All right, I still love you, and you never told me why you're ended it. So, what am I...
So, this isn't gonna work, then.
Look, I'm telling you even though I still care I can just try and do what we gotta do.
Okay. Well, that was sure a beating you put on J.B.
Yeah, well, he shouldn't have touched you.
Is that the only reason you did that?
He shouldn't have touched you ever.
I made my choice, Brody.
But why?
Because you still love Annie and I think that I remind you of her.
And I'm never going to be her.
Is that why you ran to him?
[Sighs]
You were with my sister, I'm with him.
You and I had... whatever that was, that is...
Don't you get that it's so cliché?
Bonnie, you're looking at this all the wrong way.
No, I'm looking at it the only way.
And I have to go.
Why is your neck red?
Mosquitoes, Brody.
Was it J.B.?
No.
Are you sure?
Yes.
[Engine starts]
So, this is home, huh?
Yeah, and it's as depressing as it looks.
[Whistles] Wow!
You see why I didn't tell you where I came from?
I lied. It's not that bad.
[Laughs]
Thank you so much.
You don't have to thank me.
No, you are an angel for driving me this whole way.
I owe you big time.
You don't owe me anything, Anna.
You don't.
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
So listen, I'm gonna say goodnight and get some rest and I'll swing by tomorrow and say goodbye before I hit the road again, okay?
Yeah, I'd like that.
Okay.
Don't even look out there.
Who is that?
It's just my mom.
Do you want me to wait until you get in?
Oh, no, someone's always in there.
You got it.
Get some rest.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Bye.
I want to see.
Don't.
Shut up, Mac.
It's Aunt Annie.
Mac, don't go out there! Mac!
Hi.
Hi.
How are you?
All right.
Can I come in?
Yeah.
No.
Come on.
Mac!
Come on.
I said no.
Just stop it. Let's go, come on.
That bitch.
[Engine starts]
He gone?
Yeah.
Rick.
I'm okay.
No, you stupid son of a bitch.
You use at all?
I've been sitting there.
He took all the damn money, right?
I'll get it back.
No, I wanted some too.
Well, you left! You snooze, you lose.
Son of a bitch!
Hey, I love you.
Shut up!
Shelby!
[Groans]
[Men hooting and laughing]
[Mid-tempo music plays]
Howdy!
[Laughs]
Hi.
[Clears throat]
Can I get a drink, please?
It's a bar.
I would like a Martini, neat, please.
A Martini?
Yeah.
Hey, Lilly.
Yeah?
This one wants a fruity drink.
She makes the fruity drinks.
It's not a fruity drink.
Hey.
Hi.
What will it be?
Martini.
Oh, you're not from around here, are you?
No.
Okay.
Make it neat, please.
Sure.
Here you go.
You don't have a Martini glass?
Sorry, baby, and you may want that cup because you may wanna take this with you.
But I wanna join in on the dancing.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Why not?
Baby, I am doing you a favor.
Oh... [Chuckles]
Thanks, but...
I'm a big boy.
Uh-huh.
Okay, don't say I didn't warn you.
I love a good warning.
Cheers.
Hey, where's the money?
We take credit too.
Credit?
There you go.
Thank you, sir.
We'll open a tab for you.
Cheers.
Ooh, girl, I like those shorts.
Oh, thank you. Buy me a drink.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I was just commenting on your shorts.
I'm not trying to hook up with you.
Well, why not?
You're not my type.
Well, I think I could be.
If you had a pen1s.
Oh, you're a fg.
That's offensive.
Well, what do you call it, then?
I'm gay, sweetheart. Sometimes.
Oh. Sorry.
Well, you shouldn't use that word.
That's like me saying trailer park trash to describe you.
I'm
Yeah, okay.
Look, I'm sorry, I am. I'm sorry. Come on, get me a drink.
Lilly!
I don't think...
Lilly, give me a drink. My friend here will pay for it.
I don't think he wants to buy you a drink.
Yes, he will... Look, I'm sorry.
Come on. I've had a hell of a night.
Let's dance. Come on, come on.
Let's dance! Come on, baby! Whoo!
How have you been?
Bonnie's not here.
Yeah, I figured. I didn't see her car.
Why are you here?
Rebel.
You screw the president?
Saw that on the news.
Shut up. She didn't do that.
That's not what
 said.
They said you were the last one with him.
I'm not gonna tell you again to stop it.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna tell Bonnie when she gets here.
[Scoffs]
Where's your grandma?
Next door.
Well, she didn't answer.
She can't.
Why not?
A lot has changed since you walked out on me.
You don't understand, Rebel.
No, I don't. None of us do.
I had to try to get a job so that I could help take care of all us.
Oh, don't give me that crap. I'm not a kid.
Grandma tell you that I was working?
Sure did.
Why can't your grandma open the door?
Is she sick?
Yeah, she is, in her head.
She's not sick.
Well, then why can't she?
Go see for yourself.
No.
Let her go.
You don't want to go there.
Why not?
Why not?
Let her go.
Rebel.
Go see her.
She needs dinner.
Here, just take it to her.
We were debating who would go over, so it's a good thing you're here.
Take it to her.
Rebel.
Let her. We have been doing it this whole time... let her.
Well, I would but she won't answer the door.
She can't.
Why?
Will someone tell me why?
Go see for yourself.
Annie, don't go over there.
You have to go through the back door.
The keys are under the mat.
Rebel.
Shut up!
She should go see what we've been dealing with.
Aunt Annie...
I'll go, I'll go.
I'll do it.
No. No, you won't. She will.
Stop arguing.
I'll do it.
[TV chatter, dog barks]
:
Thank you.
Well, we have a wild show today... 
[Fly buzzing]
Annie.
Hi.
Oh, baby, how are you?
I'm okay.
I'm fine.
You sure?
Yeah. [Clears throat]
Well, I was worried about you.
No, I'm fine, Mama.
Are you sure? I saw the news.
Yeah, I'm sure. [Clears throat]
You were in there with the president?
No, I didn't do anything to him.
They say you was having an affair with him.
That true or not?
No, Mama.
You're lying to me.
No, no, ma'am.
Oh, yeah, you're lying.
Is that my food?
Yeah.
Bring it over.
Come closer. I don't bite.
I cannot reach that, girl.
Aren't you even gonna hug me?
Look at you... so skinny. [Chuckles]
I would never wanna be that skinny.
Standing there looking like your daddy.
Sit down.
No, I'll stand.
Yeah, I know I disgust you.
No, Mama.
Don't lie to me again.
That is three times since you've been in here.
I'm sorry, Mama.
You lied about the president, you lied about sleeping with him, and now you lie that I look okay to you.
Yeah. Yeah, I disgust you.
Look how you're looking at me.
I was big before you left.
I know... not this big, but you've been gone for four years.
Broke my knee, I couldn't get around anymore.
I just... there was so much pain!
I just can't get around like I used to.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm sorry.
Oh, you're sorry.
Oh, you feel sorry for me.
[Chuckles]
I'm just sorry that you...
I'm just sorry that you broke your knee.
I see.
Well, I thought that gene skipped you.
What gene?
That whore gene that all your sisters have.
Bonnie, Shelby...
Oh, she got a huge portion of it.
[Sighs]
I was so proud of you, and then you go and do this and bring shame to the whole family.
You just left. You never called.
You left us here to fend for your daughter.
[Chuckles] And that little bitch, she's mean as a copperhead snake.
Yeah, you left us here to fend for ourselves, and you up there living in a damn mansion.
They say he was taking care of you in a mansion, is what them folks say.
That man give you all that money, you can't give us a damn dime.
That wasn't how it was.
Don't you dare get sick.
No! Don't you dare get sick in here!
Get on out of here!
And we ain't done talking about this!
[Door opens, closes]
[Moaning]
[Gagging]
There that b*st*rd is.
All right.
[Tires screech]
Stupid son of a bitch.
Stop it! What are you doing?
Hey, hey, hey! What the hell is going on?
What was in the rig, J.B.?
What... what are you talking about?
Some guy just came here and said that you stole something.
S... somebody came and talked to you?
And he choked the f*ck out of me, J.B.
Baby, oh, baby. I'm so... I am so...
What? Don't say you're sorry to me!
What's going on?
It was your sister's fault.
She stole my truck.
What was in the truck?
It was just my load, Bonnie.
No, they wouldn't send a thug like that for some televisions, so tell me right now what was in the truck.
Please tell me the truth.
I...
What?
I got...
I only did it one time.
What did you do, J.B.?
I was told that I could get $30,000 if I made the job.
Drugs?
[Sniffs] Yeah.
Yeah?
Are you out of your mind?
Hey, I'm sorry.
Don't ever tell me that you're sorry again.
Well, I was doing it for us.
You were?
Yeah. I was doing it for us.
You were doing it for us?
I was doing it for us. I saw how your mama is struggling and I saw and I saw how you were struggling...
You put me in danger.
You put my family in danger.
No, I was doing it for us.
I was trying! Damn it, Bonnie, I was trying!
You don't give a sh1t about me or any of my family!
You are so...
That's all I care about, Bonnie!
Why do you think I did this?
You are so sad.
Yeah, I'm sad. I'm sad.
You better fix this.
Okay?
All right.
Well, I gotta find your sister.
Yeah, you better fix this, J.B.
You gotta help me...
You got to tell me where she is, Bonnie.
Why is Rick's truck here, Bonnie?
Hey! Bonnie!
Hey, Bonnie, Bonnie.
Bonnie, Bonnie! Bonnie!
Hey.
[Tires screech]
[Music playing]
Hey.
Hey.
Looking good in those shorts, girl.
You are wearing them jeans, honey.
Thank you.
Hey, Lilly!
Lilly, bring us some shots, babe!
Make it four! Hey, baby blue eyes.
[Chuckles]
Shelby.
Shelby!
What?
He wants to have fun. Let's have some fun!
Get out of here!
No, he's a nice guy.
No. You're drunk, and you've had too much, too.
So get on out of here.
Give me the damn shots, Lilly.
Girl, are you paying attention?
[Speaking indistinctly]
Shelby, you need to leave.
Oh, come on.
I make a lot of money for you.
Let me have some fun. Whoa!
You're gonna get this boy killed.
Oh, shut up. You're so boring!
Shelby!
Whoo!
No!
Give me some shots. Put it on the card. Put it on the card.
Baby, it's okay.
I got this.
[Both cheering]
[Groaning and coughing]
You see?
What happened to her?
She got fat.
What the hell is this?
It's disgusting?
Rebel, don't.
Don't what?
Don't you call my name.
That's what me and Mac and Aunt Bonnie had been dealing with all the time... her.
She always needs something.
I'm sorry.
Save all that sorry.
If you were sorry, you would have helped us.
To being gay sometimes, baby.
[Both cheer]
[Music continues]
[Laughs]
Hold on. Vibrate.
Ooh, I like vibrate.
How about that? [Laughs]
Hello?
[Man speaks indistinctly]
I can't hear you.
Victor?
Hello? Okay, okay. [Chuckles]
[Purrs] [Purrs]
[Laughs]
Hello?
Victor?
Don't you leave me now.
I won't.
You come back. I'll be right here, baby.
[Laughs]
Victor?
What?
Where are you?
I'm out.
Oh. Where?
What do you want?
Just calling to check on you.
Is that right?
Are you drunk?
Are
 drunk?
Victor, where are you?
I'm out.
Where is Anna?
What do you want?
I just want to know where you are.
Are you calling to apologize?
I'm calling to see if you're safe.
So you know I'm safe.
Victor, please.
Let me know where you are.
And if I don't?
I don't want to play these damn games with you.
Ooh, such attitude.
Victor.
You need to apologize.
I'm sorry.
I don't believe you.
I am. Now let me know where you are.
I'm at the Honky Tonk.
A... a what?
A country bar.
Where's Anna?
She's not with me.
Are you by yourself?
Yeah.
Who's driving you?
I'm a big boy.
Victor, I'm worried about you.
Let me talk to Anna.
She's not with me.
[Crying] I don't want you being alone.
Hey, Tanner, Donna. Hey, y'all seen Shelby?
Not recently, no, unless she's inside.
I'm fine.
Victor!
I love it here.
Maybe I'll take home one of these fine country boys and let them show me a good time tonight.
Like this one here. Hey!
[Smooches] Hey, baby.
What the hell you just say?
That's that son bitch that grabbed my ass.
: Kick his ass, J.B.
Victor, stop it.
So, you're up for a good time?
Uh...
Victor, get away from there.
I'm sorry. I just... I had a little too much to drink.
No, see, I don't think you had too much to drink.
No, really, I just...
You just what?
I think he meant what he said.
: I think so.
Come on, guys, it's all just...
Yeah, well, it's all just what?
Victor?
... go inside, I'll get you all some drinks and we can just forget this all happened.
How about that? Come on, man.
Victor!
Victor!
Victor...
Hello?
[Indistinct shouting]
Victor!
What the hell are you guys doing?
What, are you trying to kill him?
Annie! Oh, my god!
Come here, take a look. Your daddy help him?
 daddy.
She's mean, she's wicked, and this is what we've been dealing with while you were gone.
This exact thing.
What happened to her?
What do you mean?
Oh, she's huge!
Why is she here?
Why is she here in happy?
Give him 2 CC of this.
Who was that?
Nobody.
Why does she have to stay here?
Stop it.
I want my cut, damn it!
I want my cut! Get out of here now!
What's going on, Tony?
Hey, she just left here.
Shelby?
