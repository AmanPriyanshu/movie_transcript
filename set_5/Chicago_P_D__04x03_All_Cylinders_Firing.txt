Mr. Platt was found in his apartment.
He'd been beaten, shot several times with a .357 caliber.
He's got no priors, but he was investigated by Financial Crimes and the IRS.
Three buildings, his development company put up, they went bankrupt.
He made a lot of people rich in the '80s and lost money for them ever since.
Neighbor called in shots fired at 10:04 p.m.
Patrol responded by throwing the zone operator a code 19-Paul.
And nobody else called in the shots?
No, so patrol didn't knock, but that gives us a timeline.
Platt leaves her house, offender enters, shoots Robert.
Platt buys a water bottle at CVS.
15 minutes later, she's attacked.
And he wasn't robbed.
Nothing appeared to be disturbed, except for the living room where there was an apparent struggle.

[indistinct P.A. announcement]
It's gonna be okay.
I mean, he's not gonna breathe free air again, so we can just move on.
Move on?
He hasn't been arraigned.
There is gonna be a trial.
You're gonna testify.
I... we can move on from the worst part.
You say so.
I do.
How did they find him, McGregor?
Some old muscle car he had.
Guy gets out of prison, goes straight for his old ride.
The tactical team located him.
[exhales]
I thought I was having a coronary event, you out chasing a killer like that.
I made a mistake.
A mistake?
You... sometimes you forget that I'm the police.
And I worked the streets, and I did it for a long time.
[cries]
And you forget you're someone's wife now.
I know what you did way back when.
And you did what you had to do.
But tonight?
I don't know.
I wish we'd met when we were younger.
[cries]
I love you.
I love you too.
