Thank you so much for doing the MRI.
I know that you weren't crazy about it, but I... I needed this.
And I... I know I was... I went a little crazy today, and... I just... I got really scared.
I needed to know.
Um...
This is a list of the very, very, very best O.B.s that I know.
What?
What do you mean?
Because I can't be your doctor.
Wait, listen...
Listen, I am... I'm sorry.
I just needed to know for sure.
If I'm gonna be your doctor, then I can't be your friend.
And... and I want to be your friend.
No, come on.
(Sighs)
I'm sorry.
♪
(Sniffles)
Oh.
(Sighs) You just getting started?
Something like that.
Ugh. I had the saddest day.
Two old men, impossible love... the worst.
I just want to go home and crawl into bed.
Then go.
Wow.
Are you okay?
(Shakily) I, uh...
(Voice breaking) I broke up with Kyle. (Sighs)
Oh, Steph.
(Sniffles)
What happened?
Shepherd, uh, cut into his brain today without me.
Yeah, she made me sit in the waiting room, and all I could think about was...
I was him when I was a kid... in and out of hospitals for years and... and I just can't sit in the waiting room.
(Sniffles) I can't handle it.
(Crying) I need to be on the other side of the red line.
I need to be helping people and fixing people, and I can't do that if I'm with him, so...
So you chose surgery.
No, I chose me.
You want to go for a drink?
No. No.
I... (Sniffles) I want to go to work.
(Door opens, closes)
I thought today was gonna be bad.
I mean, epically bad.
But?
I got Mer and Hunt.
(Sighs) See? I told you Mer was gonna side with you.
I think we have a real shot at this.
I feel better than I did this morning. How are you?
I spent the day with Dr. Robbins.
I was on her service.
Oh, God.
How was it? Was it terrible? Was she terrible to you?
Not at all.
She was great.
Huh.
Hey! Wait for me!
Are you coming?
We figured you'd be staying at Owen's place.
No, I told you, there is no me and Owen. We're not a thing.
Oh, 'cause it seemed like you were when we saw his thing.
Oh, my God!
(Laughs)
Oh, are we not doing that anymore?
You are a thing. It's happening all the time, and it should, but not on my couch.
I second that.
And you have happiness, and you keep throwing it away.
Stop the drama. Just get on with it already.
She makes a really good point.
Don't you start. You do it, too.
You fell for an intern and freaked out because it was against the rules.
Who cares about that?
No one!
Get it together, sisters.
Amelia, come on.
Let's go.
We can't just leave her.
Yes, we can.

(Sighs)
What are you doing?
(Chuckles) I went for a walk.
What are you doing?
Oh, gee, okay.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I think so.
Okay. Yes. Here it goes. Okay.
You and I are not the kind of people who say, "I love you."
Well...
At least, I'm not anymore, because, uh, I know better. I... ιt's a lie.
You don't just meet your perfect match and then everything is beautiful and perfect, and that's not how life works.
And if anyone understands that, it is you and me.
I'm having trouble understanding you right now.
Oh, stick with me. Okay. Ι... create these obstacles out of dead people, and... drugs... that I may or may not do, and sisters-in-law.
And I do... I know that I make this tough.
It feels like work.
'Cause it's gonna be work.
If you and I (sighs) move forward together...
It is harder to... (Sighs)
It's harder... to love somebody than to walk away from them.
And this is... this would be...
This... (Groans) Oh, geez. This is messy and scary and...
God, Owen, it just... It scares the life out of me.
I'm scared, too.
(Sighs)
If you and I decide to be together...
I mean really together...
I will wind up screwing all of this up.
Me, too. That is how I feel.
I screw everything up. All the time.
Oh, well.
Amelia... (Clears throat)
Let's screw some things up.
