: “Supernatural” by Carver Edlund.
: What's Carver Edlund's real name?
Chuck Shurley? Who gave you the rights to our life story?!
One day, these books -- they'll be known as the Winchester Gospel.
Want to know what she is, Crowley? How about God's sister?
He has relatives?
So, what, she shows up, and everybody goes “28 Days Later”?
This is Metatron.
: Scribe of God.
We have your grace. You're mortal now.
The indignities! I'm looking for God.
He didn't feel the need to show up for the apocalypse.
He just doesn't think it's his problem.
Why would he give a crap now?
I don't know, maybe because she's his sister.
All your chosen are suffering!
Don't count on God! Count on us.
Maybe now He'll hear me.

We were besties, you know.
Well, I wouldn't exactly say --
This is some kind of punishment, isn't it?
For my sins.

You really think I'm a hack?
I have trudged through your complete oeuvre -- published and unpublished.
Of the metric ton of books I've read in my lifetime, “Supernatural” didn't even crack the top 10... thousand.
Respectfully.
You didn't like 
 of it?
Mnh-mnh.
Not even “Home”?
No.
Or “All Hell Breaks Loose”?
Ugh! Way too much melodrama.
And then you put yourself in the story?
God!
Okay, that's fair. Mildly constructive.
Still, it doesn't justify you... burning one of my books, though. [ Chuckles ]
What are you talking about?
“Tall Tales.”
You were monologuing it to Castiel, and you threw one in the fire.
How do you know about that?
Oh, I'm sorry. I always forget.

Yeah, beating on Cass in the meantime.
Yeah.
Uh, Hope Springs, Idaho. A guy named Wes Cooper killed himself after killing a co-worker.
According to the reports, though, nobody knows why.
Apparently, he was a perfectly happy guy, and then... snap.

You can head home after you show Agent Greer the M.E. files.
Thank you, Sir.
Thanks.
What do you have on Wes Cooper?
I talked to his friends, family.
Nobody can make heads or tails of why he did this.
We have a witness who overheard Wes before he took his own life.
He was saying things that sounded out of character.
Yeah? How so?
Wes said that his life was meaningless, nobody loved him.
It was like every negative thought he had ever had came spilling out.
The thing is...
I knew Wes' wife. We sang in choir together.
She loved Wes till the day she died.
I don't know why he'd say anything like that.
And then there's this.
Hold on a second.
I've actually seen something like that before.
Deputy, tell me, have you noticed any strange phenomena around town?
Uh, sulfur smells or power outages?
Maybe an unexplained fog?
No, sir.
It's always sunny in Hope Springs.
At least, it used to be.
Are you in a hurry or something?
I'm on a bit of a deadline.
Just give me some broad strokes, first impressions.
Come on, hit me.
It's good.

I mean, I'm hooked, and I was there.
I'm hooked, too, and yet... details.
You weren't alone in the beginning.
Your sister was with you.
Who cares about her?
Um... me...for starters.
I assume you're aware that she's... out and about.
Tanned, rested, and ready.
I mean, that's why you're back, right?
This isn't her story.
It's mine.

Hey, dispatch, this is 3-William-56.
You got your ears on?

[ Cue ball clacks ]
That bad?
I'll tell you, there's some great bones in there.
I'm thinking what's missing -- maybe less about detail and more about balance.
How do you mean?
You're giving the wrong stuff too much real estate.
Like that chapter about being Chuck.
Mm-hmm. And what about it?
Once you've explained the Vonnegut performance art... that should be it.
No one cares about the rest.
I did some great stuff as Chuck.
I mean, I-I told you about my blog.
Oh. Oh, right, yeah. Right.
Your, uh -- Your cat-pic blog.
Yeah, they're super cute.
Yeah. So there's that.
And, uh, I traveled a lot, you know.
Right. And, uh, I dated.
Yeah, I had some girlfriends.
Mm. Had a few boyfriends.
Oh. [ Chuckles ] Oh!
And I learned how to play guitar.
[ Guitar strumming ]
Hmm. Yeah.
That, you know, makes you seem like a really grounded, likable person.
Yeah, what's wrong with that?
You are neither grounded nor a person!
So you're saying I'm likable.
No, no.
I am saying the chapter “Chuckle”" is devouring pounds of pages at the expense of... juicier stuff.
Stuff that people might actually want to read.
Like what?
Well, like, uh...
Like the archangels.
I mean, you have got maybe two paragraphs on them in here.
And that's it!
Don't you think they deserve a few extra words?
Especially your favorite --
Lucifer?
He wasn't my favorite.
Oh.
He helped you defeat Amara.
You trusted him with the mark.
And when you asked him to bow to mankind --
He refused.
He rebelled!
And in doing so, kind of wrecked Christmas.
Okay, all that's in there.
Except the -- the bit about Christmas.
If you say that Amara is off limits, fine.
But you know every great hero is defined by his or her villain.
Lucifer was not a villain.
He -- He's...
H-He wasn't a villain.
Okay.
Real talk.
Th-This is still a safe place, right?
Safest place ever created.
Okay.
There are two types of memoir.
One is honest... the other, not so much.
Truth and fairy tale.
Now, do you want to write “Life” by Keith Richards?
Or do you want to write “Wouldn't It Be Nice” by Brian Wilson?
I want to tell the truth.
Then you've got some work to do.
There are no revelations in this book!
And that's weird, given who you are.
There's no new information, no soul-bearing.
That's because I don't have a soul.
Right!
But you invented them.
 invented souls!
Souls!
Try shining a light on that.
How did that make you feel?
Nauseous.
Oh! [ Groans ]
You know what?! No.
That is not G-O-D talking.
That's Chuck talking.
And I get it -- when you were on Earth, you had to go full method.
Well, it's time for you to get back into character.
This is me.
Really?
This -- This pile of self-doubt and nebbishness flooded the Earth?
Followed up Sodom with a blockbuster Gomorrah?
Created as much as he punished?
No! Unh-unh!
The guy I worked for -- total badass!
And yes, he could be a dick.
Now, 
 guy... had some stories to tell.
And he has a lot to answer for.
Okay, so... [ Clears throat ] ...what do I do?
Hold up a mirror and show us who you are.
Warts and all.

Harris didn't show up for work this morning.
We called, tried her CB, nothing.
So I swung by here.
I found Art on the kitchen floor, Harris' shotgun right next to him. She...
It looks like Deputy Harris shot her husband point-blank in the face, then left the scene.
Did you notice anything off about Deputy Harris' behavior the last couple days?
No. Nothing at all.
When was the last time anyone heard from her?
Called in for the last time yesterday.
Said something about... seeing some fog rolling in.
I don't know why she cared about the damn weather.
Would you get in contact with your dispatch officer?
Tell her to let us know if she gets any more reports like that again.
You serious?
Yeah, just to be safe.
And do you have any idea where Harris might be now?
No.
But we

I thought if I could show my sister that there was something more than just us, something better than us, then maybe she'd change.
Maybe she'd stop... being...her.
But... every time I'd build a new world... she'd destroy it.
So you and your archangels... locked her away?
And you got down to unfettered creation.
Tried to, anyway.
But... this was as close as I got to something as good as or better than me or my sister.

I mean, look what nature created on its own.
What's more, nature's smart enough to know that sometimes, there's no fixing things.
Sometimes you just have to wipe the slate clean.
