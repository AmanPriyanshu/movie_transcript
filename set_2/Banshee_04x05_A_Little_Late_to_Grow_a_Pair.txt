[car approaching]
: So, where's your place?
: About a mile through the woods.
This is rustic. Some backyard you got here.
Yeah, I like the quiet.
Ugh, I f*cking hate it.
What, too many voices in your head?
You have no idea.
You should talk to someone about that.
Well, why the hell do you think I gave you a ride?
I'm honest. You're silent.
We both got our things.
I mean, you're obviously punishing yourself for something.
And what sh1t do you wish you hadn't done?
Oh, we definitely haven't drank enough for all that. [chuckles]
So is this the part where you tell me to just forgive myself and move on?
I don't know what you did.
Maybe it's not forgivable. [sighs]
Did you forgive yourself?
No.
But I don't punish myself either.
I mean, I figure the world's gonna do that to me one way or another anyway.
You want to talk about Rebecca Bowman?
I'm not judging...
Don't.
I said... don't.
[sighs] What do you want?
I'm just trying to figure out if I'm gonna keep running into you on this.
And we both know I can't stop you from poking around, but it would make my life easier if you could just keep me in the loop.
Of course.
Thanks for the ride.
[thunder rumbling]
[engine starts]
Don't be a stranger.
[music]
Listen, I've had a really bad few days.
I thought we had a deal. Rebecca was off-limits to you.
You knew I was living here?
I thought you were keeping her safe.
That wasn't my responsibility.
f*cking her was?
I should kill you right now.
Well, get the f*ck on with it.
You find whoever did this to her.
FBI has it covered.
FBI is gonna arrest him, most likely kill him.
You bring him to me.
And you'll need to find another place to live.
[theme music playing]
[clicking]
Let's go.
Ms. Bowman, I really think we should...
Take out the goddamn box.
Felix... where's my money?
Ms. Bowman...
Where the f*ck is my money?!
Your uncle.
He came and took it.
What?
That's my box. You can't just...
There are rules.
Rebecca, put that gun away.
Put that gun away!
It's okay, Felix.
Yes.
Have you lost your mind?
You took my money?
Skimming cash from my strip club, locking it in a box doesn't make it yours.
You may not have paid me that money, but I earned it.
Every f*cking penny.
If you want to point that at me, you had better be ready to shoot it.
Shoot it!
[music]
We'll talk about this later.
Watts, come on, man. This is bullshit.
You shut the f*ck up and do as you're told.
[sighs]
Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Reminds me of how blessed I am to be a free man.
You said you had something you wanted to show me.
That I do.
My son-in-law's epic fuckup 
But I'm here now and I wanted to show you firsthand I'll be running a much tighter ship.
Pony Joe here was in charge the night your factory got torched.
: Do it.
Now.
You know it wasn't my fault! Hey!
Calvin!
[breathing heavily]
Don't do this!
Come on!
Calvin! Calvin!
[engine starts]
: Let's go, Calvin.
Hit it, boy!
Don't do this.
[screams]
[no audio]
I will have zero tolerance for fuckups.
What about the production delays?
Already started outfitting...
I need three tons in eight days.
That kind of volume usually means beaners.
Attract a lot of unfriendly attention on both sides of the borders.
You got one hell of a pair of balls on you, I'll give you that.
Banshee will become the distribution hub for the entire East Coast pipeline.
As long as I can count on you, the Brotherhood will be well compensated.
Employed is fine and good, but you're talking about the cartels now.
And for that kind of risk, I don't want to be compensated.
I want a piece.
Mr. Watts, you make this delivery on time, I'm sure you and I will come to an agreement about your piece.
Glad to hear it.
You hear that, bow tie?
You and me is gonna be buddies. [pats]
Well... that went better than expected.
We just killed one of our own for that f*cking Dutchie.
Yeah, it was him or you. Don't think I didn't consider it.
Now go clean this sh1t up.
[sighs]
Congratulations, Job.
28 hours.
That's a new record.
Now, your over-under with the guards wasn't too good, but...
I never doubted you.
Why? Why ain't you just killed me yet?
I could do that.
I could. But honestly, I'd miss these little sessions of ours.
I'll see you tomorrow.
[choking]
[gasping]
That's one way to get down.
[door slams]
[gasps]
[breathing heavily]
: Hey.
You okay?
I'm fine. [clears throat]
More nightmares?
If you ever want to talk about it...
No.
Okay.
You can still make yourself useful.
What the f*ck is this?
No free lunches.
This is bullshit. I'm convalescing.
I do not do windows!
So they let you out.
Yeah, you sound surprised.
[scoffs]
No. Nothing surprises me anymore when it comes to you.
But for what it's worth, I was pretty sure you didn't kill the girl.
Thanks very much.
I mean, come on. How well do you ever know a man?
How's Job?
Why don't you pay him a visit and find out for yourself?
I will.
You smell like an ashtray.
Yeah, I had a fire.
Proctor.
Yeah, he was pretty angry about your relations with his niece.
That still doesn't make me a murderer.
Doesn't make him one either... in this particular case.
You mind I go next door, take a shower?
Oh, you have to use mine.
Your place belongs to the termites.
Exterminators say we got to burn the place down else they'll be over here.
That's probably for the best, huh?
You got a place to stay?
[music]
This is a bad idea.
: You think we are who we are?
Or you think we can change?
What, you mean people like you?
[music]
Seriously?
I know it's a clich√©, 
What's there to tell?
My father was a monster that got what he deserved.
Do you really believe that?
I had a dream about him the other night.
We were at Coney Island at the boardwalk.
After the rides, we would have popcorn and saltwater taffy.
And we would sit on the same bench and he would tell me stories about my mother.
Then we'd take our shoes off and put our feet in the surf.
And what happened in the dream?
Nothing.
I mean, I don't know.
We were just there.
You miss him.
How f*cked up is that?
[music]
[door opens]
[door closes]
Well, look who got out of jail... again.
So how you doing?
You look better.
Yeah, I'm a real fashion plate.
How about you?
What about me?
I hear you went native while I was away.
[sighs] Yeah. That's one way of putting it.
You got another way?
Listen, Job, I tried to find you.
We all did.
After Dalton was dead...
You mean after you killed him.
I thought you were dead.
I believed it.
And then something... something inside me, it just...
I gave up.
I'm sorry.
Well, it could have been worse.
Could have been 15 years.
You never put that sh1t on me.
Rabbit f*cked us.
Yes, he did.
On my watch.
Baby, all our bullshit... that's all in the past.
 we ain't ever getting that time back.
So... what you really need to worry about is what's happening in the here and now.
What do you mean?
Our little friend is building a fortress and she is armed to the teeth.
For what?
Seems she feels the only way to honor her dead husband is to finish his war on Proctor herself.
Mr. Watts has made provisions to keep all five facilities running around the clock.
I'll need you to keep an eye on things.
I don't trust him.
If I don't deliver on my promise to the Colombians, Watts is gonna be the least of our problems.
Stop the car. Stop the car!
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor?
Mayor Proctor, why are offices holding on with Rebecca Bowman's body?
[reporters continue clamoring]
What the hell are you doing, Miriam?
We want her back, Kai.
You can't keep her like this.
I'm not keeping her.
You can fix it.
Rebecca wasn't the only girl who was killed.
She's the only one we need to bury.
It's not right keeping her body like that. It's disrespectful.
I'm gonna give you two minutes to get these men out of here.
We will not leave without Rebecca.
You lost all rights to Rebecca when you shunned her!
If you don't leave right now, I'm gonna have you dragged away and put into jail.
We are not scared of you anymore, Kai. There's nothing else you can do to us.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Mr. Mayor?
Mayor Proctor...
Mayor Proctor...
[cameras clicking]
Sir, sir.
[crowd murmurs]
We should go inside.
[crowd whispering]
[cameras clicking]
I want these steps cleared right now. You understand?
They have a permit.
I don't give a sh1t.
[crowd whispering]
Jesus Christ, Hood...
Afternoon, sheriff.
You have any idea how many laws you just broke?
You gonna arrest me again?
If you came looking for an apology, you're not gonna get one.
You know I wouldn't do the same thing.
You would have shot me.
[chuckles] Yeah, maybe.
What... What do you want?
Heard there was another girl.
Any leads?
Other than a six-year-old witness who can barely speak English, no.
You're not gonna stay out of this, are you?
You know, I got to ask, you really didn't know she was pregnant?
No.
Must have been quite a shock.
I'm sorry, Hood.
Miss Francis?
Yes.
I'm Sheriff Brock Lotus from the BSD.
We spoke after your sister was found.
I remember. I already answered all your questions.
The FBI, too.
No, I know. And I... we appreciate it.
These are... Jill's personal belongings.
I just want to return them to you.
Look, I can only imagine how hard this must be for you...
This guy killed three women and he was still out there free walking around to kill Jill?
I know.
[buzzing]
Howdy, Kurt.
You're out.
They let me go and it got me thinking.
Everybody deserves a second chance.
Come back to the family, Kurt. We need you.
Now more than ever.
Calvin, he talks a big game, 
You want me to... rejoin the Brotherhood?
Come on.
What do you say?
Randall...
I don't know how you got out.
You made a mistake coming back here.
How's that?
Because now that I know that you're out, I'm gonna dedicate myself to putting you back in.
[chuckles] Yeah.
I mean, hell, you got to be you, right?
Well, look, tonight I'm gonna party.
Celebrate my emancipation.
Tomorrow I'm gonna get to work.
If you haven't accepted my offer by then, you're gonna be the first order of business.
[chatter]
[phone ringing]
Helen, call everybody and tell them I'm holding a press conference in one hour.
What are you gonna do?
What I should have done a while ago.
[chattering]
[huffing]
[motor starts]
[buzzing]
[whinnies]
[gasps]
What is the meaning of this?
You won't be selling your produce in Banshee anymore.
You won't be selling your produce... anywhere.
[all gasp]
Kai!
[speaking Pennsylvania Dutch] _
[crying]
Four young women have been brutally and senselessly murdered by a twisted coward who praise on those smaller and weaker than himself.
[inhales]
You Tocho?
Can I draw, too?
But obviously we haven't yet.
And for that, I take full responsibility.
: You know, I used to be a policeman.
Even though I don't do it anymore, sometimes I still help them chase the bad guys away.
Is that the man you saw the other night in the woods?
See these things you drew on his head?
Are they horns?
I would like to talk directly to you... you sad, pathetic coward.
I don't know what you have convinced yourself that you are, but you will never be anything more than a sad little... freak.
I am gonna find you. I am.
And I'm gonna take you down and I'm gonna make sure that you never hurt anyone else ever again.
[music playing]
‚ô™ I walk ‚ô™

‚ô™ A winding road ‚ô™

‚ô™ Every step a heavy load ‚ô™

‚ô™ My heart became a ball and chain... ‚ô™
You drinking?
Whiskey, rocks.
I've heard good things about this place.
But where's the real action?
I think you do.
Go home, little girl.
Not until I find what I'm looking for.
Thank you for the tip.
[music thumping]
: Whoo!
[laughter echoing]
[whip cracks]
[woman whimpers]
[man moaning]
[woman gasping]
[sizzling]
That's just nasty.
What the f*ck?
You shouldn't be here.
Yeah? Well, bad choices are sort of my thing.
But you must know something about that.
I don't know who you are, but the rules here are very simple.
No one walks out the same way they walk in.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that.
See, I'm pretty kinky, but you guys, you're f*cked up.
[both panting]
You come here, too?
How'd you know I was here?
I didn't.
The Kinaho kid drew this.
This is the only place in town where the freaks have horns.
How'd you get here?
Our murders are consistent with other ritualistic murders in the FBI database.
Pointed to Satanism.
Hey, shitneck, where'd you get your work done?
Where did you get your work done?
Get f*cked. [groans]
Wrong answer. [groaning]
Guy named Quick. Dr. Quick.
He's a surgeon?
Yeah. No. He used to be.
Where do we find him?
Works out of the back of a dry cleaner over on Swanson.
You kids need to find a new hobby.
[sniffs]
[gasps]
It's you.
Hey, Gail.
You seem nervous.
No, I just... I just didn't expect you to be here.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.
I've been watching you, Gail.
But your commitment is very pure.
I find that exciting.
Thank you.
We're a lot alike, Gail.
You're a true believer, aren't you?
I am. I am.
That's good, because I have chosen you for a very special honor.
Will you serve him with me?
I will. I will.
Thank you.
: Is there a problem, Deputy?
Just answering your prowler call.
We didn't call no police.
Must have been your neighbors.
Must have been.
'Course, we ain't got none of those.
No. No, you don't.
Why'd you leave your car all the way at the end of the road?
It's a long walk to this here gate.
Do you live here?
Just visiting.
It's a lot of surveillance equipment.
Well, you know what they say, just 'cause you're paranoid don't mean they ain't all out to get you.
Words to live by.
Mm-hmm.
Have a safe night.
I'll do my best.
[buzzing]
[gasps]
[exhales]
‚ô™ This is a house of pain, yet my love remains ‚ô™

‚ô™ trapped chains for you to torture me ‚ô™

‚ô™ To kill is my way out, do I do or die? ‚ô™

‚ô™ There's only blood left to cry, this is a house of pain ‚ô™

‚ô™ A house of pain, yet my love remains... ‚ô™
I just want to say a few things real quick.
I gotta thank you all for this celebration.
It's great to see all of you.
[music stops]
Now, I look around and I see, man, a lot of changes since I went in. A lot of changes.
But after eight years in a cage, there's one thing that hasn't changed at all.
That's my commitment to all of you.
[cheering]
Like it or not, you degenerates are my family.
Family sticks together.
[cheers]
No matter what.
And on a personal note, I've done my time.
And I'm tired of living in the gutter in the name of the cause.
But we's also allowed to enjoy some of the spoils of war.
[cheers]
So I have laid plans.
Plans that will put some of those spoils into our own pockets.
[cheers]
And with that money comes security.
And with that, power.
Tonight we drink.
[cheers]
Tonight we f*ck.
[cheers]
And tomorrow, the new Aryan revolution begins.
[music resumes]
What the f*ck was that?
That was a new beginning, Calvin.
Money? That's f*cking pitch.
Money? Since when has the Brotherhood been about money?
Don't be a f*ck up, Calvin. I take care of my own ideas don't pay the rent. We can't all put on ties, suck dick for some sh1t asking glamour.
You're selling out the Brotherhood, everything we worked for, look, you went to f*cking jail for!
I went to jail for my brothers, for my family, for you, you ungrateful sh1t.
And I come out and I see you sh1tting all over the deals I made, looking at me like I'm in your f*cking way?
Now, Maggie, she married the wrong brother.
Kurt might be confused, but at least he got balls.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's f*cking party!
[cheering]
[music]
: Bunker. Really?
What are you doing?
[sighs] What the hell are you doing?
Brock, leave me alone. That's Randall Watts, the top dog.
He just got out of jail. One shot in his head and this is over.
One shot and you're gonna have the entire Brotherhood up here.
Get up. God damn it, Bunker. Be smart.
We cannot beat them at their game. We gotta beat them at ours.
You're in uniform using one of our vehicles. What the hell are you thinking?
I'm sorry.
No, f*ck sorry!
This town's going off the rails. We got a serial killer on the prowl, we got a mayor who's a gangster, and you want to start a war with the neo-Nazis.
Look at me.
I don't have much in my life that I care about anymore, Bunker.
Just Banshee. That's it.
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna give up this town without a fight.
Now you gotta decide right now whether you want to fight with me the right way or you're just gonna be another headache I gotta handle.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Let's get the hell out of here.
That was a... [clears throat] good speech.
Ugh.
Damn. I took a couple shots back there.
But you gave some, too.
Hey, don't worry. I already checked under the bed.
You should get some rest.
I should. [sighs]
But I can't drink all this scotch by myself.
Yeah, I think we both know that's not true.
Try and tell me you don't need a drink after that madness we just witnessed back there.
Yeah, you have a point. [chuckles]
Jeez.
[exhales]
So, we gonna track down that surgeon?
I'm not a cop anymore.
Even when I was, I wasn't much of a team player.
But we're both out there looking for the same guy.
Might as well have each other's backs.
I know you can go it alone.
Me, too. That's why they sent me.
But this guy is... a different kind of bad news.
And this is your town. You know the lay of the land.
And I could really use the backup.
[music]
[sighs]
Okay.
Maggie.
Oh, I've been trying to reach you. They let my dad out.
I know. He came to see me earlier.
You've gotta do something, okay? You can't wait any longer.
I'm working on it, Maggie, but this is a lot bigger than just your father and Calvin.
You're talking about the drugs.
How do you know about that?
I found these on Calvin's desk.
Jesus Christ, Maggie, if he caught you...
I'm just trying to give you what you need, okay? This is some kind of a production schedule.
There's some big delivery coming up, I think.
This was on Calvin's desk?
Yeah, why?
These are very large quantities.
This isn't just... local drug dealing. This is...
These numbers...
[sighs]
I swear to you, this is almost over.
But I need you to go home and pretend like everything's okay.
Kurt, I-I-I can't do this much longer, okay?
I'm scared all the time.
I know. I will get you out of there.
I promise.
[music]
So, did you make me one? [sighs]
I want you out of here.
This is my house and you are not welcome.
[snickers]
That's cute, Calvin, but... it's a little late to grow a pair.
How about you just shut the f*ck up and pour me a drink?
[sighs]
[snickers] f*ck it. I'll do it myself.
[grunts]
[music]
[buzzing]
[music playing]
‚ô™ Let me ride on the wall of death ‚ô™

‚ô™ One more time ‚ô™

‚ô™ Let me ride on the wall of death ‚ô™

‚ô™ One more time ‚ô™

‚ô™ You can waste your time on the other rides ‚ô™

‚ô™ This is the nearest to being alive ‚ô™

‚ô™ Oh, let me take my chances on the wall of death ‚ô™

‚ô™ Oh, let me take my chances on the wall of death ‚ô™

‚ô™ Yeah, let me take my chances on the wall of death ‚ô™

‚ô™ Mm-mmm. ‚ô™
