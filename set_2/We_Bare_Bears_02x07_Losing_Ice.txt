[Music]
You ever seen someone get away from a pursuit like this?
Nope.
Bad idea, man. Bad idea.
But fun to watch.
Yep.
[Music]
[Bell dings]
Coming!
Coming!
Now what are ... [Rings] ...green sedan...
Hey, I think dinner's ready.
Nah. Probably needs more time to set up the table.
Right.
[Growls]
...police vehicles added ...
Food getting cold.
Oh, yeah.
This is almost over. We'll be right there.
Oh! Oh, look, he's getting off the freeway!
We see more police vehicles added to the chase now.
Now what are...
Ice Bear is going for walk.
Whoa! Whoa!
Oh!
[Laughing] Justice served!
Hmph!
[Sniffing] Mmm.
[Music]
[Speaking Japanese]
Mmm.
[Applause]
We're coming!
Food time!
Food-food-food! Huh? Where's our food?
Uh, Grizz, our dinner's in the trash.
Welp. Let's just wait.
He'll be back soon.
[Ticking]
I'm ... I'm starving.
Yeah, what's the deal? Where'd he go?
Why would he be so irresponsible?
Let's go find him.
[Blad rings]
[Applause]
Dude, why is he cooking for strangers?
It's like he doesn't care about us.
I can't believe it. He lied to us, he abandoned us.
What a jerk. He'll come back eventually and apologize.
No. We don't need him.
We just need to find someone who could replace him.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah!
Requirements ... cooking skills a must, clearly.
Loves the cold. Um, you get to live in a cave, which is awesome. What else?
I got one. Free room.
Oh, nice, buddy!
And send.
Yee. I hope somebody responds.
[Knock on door]
Hey, guys!
So, Darrell, tell us a little bit more about you.
Okay, well, at this moment, I manage a mouse pad store ...
Super Rad Mouse Pads.
Okay, so what do you do for fun?
Hmm, fun...
Oh! I collect rocks.
Rocks?
Oh, yeah.
Just on my way here I found this beauty.
Um, do you know how to cook?
Oh, I wish.
Most of the cooking is done by my grandmother ...
Emma Saragosa.
Totally. Uh, give me and my brother a few seconds to deliberate on our decision.
So, what do you think?
I think he's a total dweeb.
But I also think that we don't have another choice.
My thoughts exactly.
So, Darrell, you got the job.
Really?
Yup!
Really?
Yeah.
Wow. Really?
Yes.
Wow.
[Whispers] Ya did it, Darrell.
[Chirping]
Aagh!
Careful, I'm holding the groceries!
[Grunting] What's going on down there?
The same thing that's been happening all day.
Sorry, brothers! Balance has never been one of my strengths!
And uh!
Phew! That was intense.
Ouch.
I know it's kind of been a rough first day, but I promise I'll get better at this brother thing.
Okay, now you guys relax while I make dinner, okay? [Chuckles]
Yeah, Darrell is such a nice guy but, you know...
It's not the same. I really miss our little brother.
You think he'll ever come back?
Whoa! [Clatter]
Darrell, buddy, you okay in there?
What? Oh, nothing!
It just looks like the butternut squash is butter-not-happening.
Well, I guess we could go out to eat.
Ooh, hey, let's do Teppan Yaki!
We'll walk into that place with Darrell and get our little bro jealous.
Yeah, he'll have no choice but to come back.
[Speaking Japanese]
[Speaking Japanese]
Psst! Hey, what's good here?
I've never had Asian food before.
How may Ice Bear help you?
Hmm? How can this guy help us, Pan Pan?
Maybe he could help us by cooking some dinner for us!
But wait, Panda, we don't need someone to cook for us ... for we have our new brother, who happens to be an amazing cook!
Right, brother Darrell? [Laughs]
Why did they name this beef after a basketball player?
Huh?
Kobe beef not named after basketball player.
[Laughs]
Ah, your jokes are the best, brother Darrell!
Oh! [Forced laugh]
Okay, I'll get the best you can offer.
Me, too.
I'll take the grilled chicken, please.
[Blades ring and whir]
Mmm! This looks delicious!
[Chomps] Hmm!
[Sniffing] Mmm! Mmm!
[Gulping]
You guys really love the food here, don't ya?
Psst, say something.
Oh, yeah, okay. [Clears throat]
So, when are you going to quit this silly job?
[Speaking Japanese]
Hey, what did you just say?
[Speaking Japanese]
Are you really gonna make us pay?!
You're our brother! You can't abandon us like this!
Oh, wow! I didn't know this was your brother!
Nice to meet ya!
Be quiet, Darrell!
Kuma-Kun, do you know these gentlemen?
Hm. [Gasps]
How can you do this to us?!
Please leave.
But ...
[Yells in Japanese]
Huh? Gah, what?! Gah!
Nice meetin' ya!
Oh! I can't believe it! The nerve of that guy!
Yeah, abandoning us like that! Now we're stuck with...
[Muffled] Darrell over here.
Aw, c-come on, guys.
I think you're being a little too harsh on him.
M-Maybe you should, uh, think about it from his point of view...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Who's side are you on, anyways?
No, no, but, but I ...
Yeah, we don't need your opinion.
We need you to start acting more like our little brother.
W-What? No, I don't think ... I mean...
Hey, guys, why do I have to ... why ... [gulps]
Little bro skill one ... axe wielding.
Pan Pan, the log! [Grunting]
Hmm. Not bad.
Let's move on.
Little bro skill number two ... ninja star power.
[Grunting]
L-Look! I did it!
Little bro skill number three ... resilience to freezing temperatures.
Hey! Ow! Wait...
I just signed him up for 20 mixed martial arts classes.
That's a good start.
Aha! Little bro skill number four ... stacking.
What?! No, stop! [Grunts]
Aah!
Aw, come on, Darrell.
What's the matter with you? Step it up!
You know what, I have had it!
Look, it was real nice to pick me to be your brother and all, but I am through with being pushed around!
Good day to you!
Come back, Darrell!
Darrell, wait!
What ... What have we done?!
We took an innocent, if slightly lame, person and we crushed his spirit.
And now... now we have no brothers at all.
You're gonna love your new mouse pad!
Hmm. Hmpf!
Aw, come here, you guys!
We're really sorry, Darrell.
You didn't deserve to be treated like that.
Oh, I'm all choked up!
But forget about me! D-Don't you think there's someone else you ought to be apologizing to?
You're right!
We've gotta get him back! Come on, Pan Pan. Let's go!
No problem!
Sorry, Darrell, can you drive us?
There! There's the place!
Bro!
Bro, we're sorry!
We have an offering of peace!
Weren't you the gentlemen who were harassing my chef?
Please, sir, that chef was our brother.
We've done him wrong, and we've come to apologize.
Unfortunately for you, your brother's talent was too great!
He has left for somewhere greater.
Indeed, it is possible that he is at the airport already.
Darrell, he's gone to the airport!
Maybe if we hurry, we can still catch him.
Darrell, step on it!
You got it!
Oh, look out for that pothole!
I ... I got a lot of spare computer parts, but for this, I got nothing.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
We've lost him for good.
I'm sorry, Pan Pan, there's ... there's nothing we can do now.
: Good night, sweet prince.
[Both sigh]
We are so close. Let's stack up.
Um, uh, Darrell, are you totally sure about ... whoa!
[Music]
Wait, stop! Look ... the list of departures!
Oh, it's boarding now! We'll never make it in time!
I'm on it, guys! I'll go stop that plane!
Hey, stop!
[Alarm blares]
No, Panda, look!
We're... too late.
Let's go home, Grizz.
Huh? Hey, there he is!
Bro ... ahem.
Hey, man. We're really sorry that we took you for granted.
Look, I know sometimes it seems like we forget that you're there, but we really need you.
Like, really need you.
Yeah, we're basically incompetent.
Please come home, bro.
[Applauding]
[Towel snaps]
Aah!
[Applauding]
 you brought a family back together.
All right, bub. Let's go.
[Applause, laughing]
