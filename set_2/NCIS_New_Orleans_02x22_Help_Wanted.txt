Right with you, fellas.
Hey, Brody, I've been waiting for your call.
: Sorry.
Where are you?
At the bar. A little short on help tonight.
It sounds like you have your hands full, Pride.
Yeah, yeah.
It's always something.
All right. You got an update on the General Matthews leak? Talk to me.
All right. The documents with the privileged info on the case that were sent to the outlets, came from an IP address here in D.C.
Patton able to get you an exact location?
Office park outside of Arlington.
Got a thermal image of the location.
Looks like some kind of server farm.
I'll check on it first thing.
Yeah, well, be careful, Brody.
We don't know what we're dealing with.
Yeah, well, we know someone wanted to disgrace General Matthews, and two people are dead in connection with it.
We also know they were able to access our case files.
And that takes skill.
Could be looking at an Edward Snowden, or someone worse.
If you need help, call Director Vance or Gibbs.
You're alone there.
Solitude feels right.
It'll give me a chance to hear myself think.
You should try it sometime.
(laughs)
(phone beeps)
Yeah, uh, well, it won't be tonight.
I gotta go.
We got a case.
(sirens wailing)
So you see anything odd before the explosion?
Uh, this is New Orleans. You got to be a little more specific.
Like someone rushing in or out around the time it happened.
Nah, I didn't see nothing like that.
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.
Talk to me.
Explosion happened in Zolfo's kitchen.
Suspicious circumstances.
No fatalities, but ten injuries, including Navy Culinary Specialist Danielle Jarrett.
Took the brunt of the blast.
She's in town on liberty.
The mom, Elaine, stepdad, Blake, they own the place.
Witnesses?
A lot of people heard the big boom... ran the other way.
Call Wade.
Have her go to the hospital.
C.S. Jarrett may have evidence on her.
On it.
(camera shutter clicking)
Nearly impossible to keep these old places up and running, and then... something like this happens.
Brought Laurel here for her sixth birthday.
(chuckles)
First big night out.
Got a lot of memories for a lot of people.
But Arson Squad doesn't seem to think that this was an accident, but they haven't found any evidence of what caused the blast.
Take a look at this.
What do you think?
Could be a pipe bomb.
: We might have something else.
EMT... said this was near Danielle's body after they pulled her out.
A package?
Well, it could have been what the bomb came in.
Well, if that were true, it would have been obliterated in the blast.
Not necessarily.
Not if it was directional.
All right.
Print it and get it to Sebastian.
Wow, I got something.
It's the Prince of Pies.
The Prince of what?
No. Anthony Flanders.
You never heard of him?
No.
Come on.
Flanders' Landing.
He's got all those restaurants.
I don't eat at those kind of places.
Ah, that's right, all your hookups get the Michelin Star treatment.
: You son of a bitch, I'll kill you.
Oh, yeah? I'd like to see you try.
: Pride, that's him.
His print is on the package.
: Get off me.
: Break it up, now.
: Get away from me.
I come here to pay my respects and this is how I'm treated?
I want to press full charges.
Yeah, you come over here you son of a bitch.
Get your tail out of here... Mr. Flanders, charges may be pressed, but not against him.
What are you talking about?
Your prints on a suspicious package is what I'm talking about.
Let's go.
Get your damn hands off me.
You're under arrest.
On what charge?
Assaulting a Federal Officer, and suspicion of sabotage.
: What were you doing at Zolfo's after the explosion?
It was a nice night.
I took a walk.
Been looking at your record.
Intimidation. Extortion.
Look closer there.
Charged, but never convicted.
Blake Jarrett said you've been harassing him and his wife.
That guy.
I've been trying to buy them out for months.
They're too thick-headed to accept.
You know I got five locations here in the Greater New Orleans area.
You know why?
I offer large portions, at affordable price points.
Package found at the crime scene.
Handwriting look familiar?
'Cause your prints are on 'em.
You want to tell me what was inside?
Danielle Jarrett.
She almost died last night.
You know what?
I feel bad for her.
But I didn't do it.
You know, if her family sold to me, maybe none of this would've happened.
That sounds like a confession.
No, it's a fact.
I don't hurt people.
Hey, I'm the Prince of Pies.
What do you think, King?
He do this?
Not sure.
But we owe it to Danielle to find out.
Yeah, but we have his prints.
On a scrap of packaging.
Doesn't prove much yet, till Sebastian tells us what was 
 the package.
And we need to know who delivered it.
I'll head to the hospital, talk to Danielle, her parents.
Meantime, pull surveillance.
Learn things.
(breathing heavily) Oh!
God, it hurts!
Almost done here.
Hang in there.
I- I can't. I can't.
Just a few more, Danielle.
(Danielle breathes heavily)
The doctor needs to do this debridement.
I'll remove the shrapnel so there won't be infections.
You'll have evidence too, right?.
Yes, dear.
Evidence too.
(softly): Okay, good.
Where's my mom?
She's right outside, dear.
Doctor, that IV needs to be reapplied.
I keep trying to get a good vein, but they're weak.
(Danielle pants)
Here.
(Danielle cries out)
Good job, Danielle. We're all done for now.
(panting): Get the guy who did this.
We found this.
It came off some kind of package.
Well, we opened up early, around all day.
Never saw that package.
Did you notice any unfamiliar people?
Delivery men, or...
We got deliveries coming in all the time.
You and I both know that Flanders done this.
I mean, (scoffs) I watched you haul him away yesterday.
We brought him in for questioning, that's all.
He's been harassing us for months.
He's pissed we won't sell him Zolfo's.
It's been in my family for a century.
Oh, this is all my fault, isn't it?
No.
You see this, Agent Pride?
You see what Flanders done?
I could kill him.
You need to keep a cool head, Mr. Jarrett.
Mm.
: Ah.
They gave Danielle a sedative, she's resting.
You can be with her.
Oh, good.
Thank you.
Danielle say anything about the blast?
No.
Just that she wanted to get the guy who did it.
The shrapnel from her body?
I noticed a... partial number on a piece.
Maybe serial number from the bomb.
Let's get it to Sebastian.
Thanks, Loretta.
Mm-hmm.
Anything on surveillance?
We scanned the street and traffic cams.
No luck on the mystery delivery.
But then I got to thinking.
How you took Laurel to Zolfo's on her first big night out.
Yeah. And how my mom took me and my brother first time we visited New Orleans.
Lots of pictures, probably too many.
I wore this little tuxedo.
Man, I was looking studly.
Did you also learn to use the little fork?
No, I learned that in cotillion.
(phone chimes)
Damn.
I was supposed to be at the bar, let the electrician in.
You want to go?
(sighs) No.
No time, I'll reschedule.
Pictures.
Right. So we got Zolfo's reservation list, called everyone on it, scanned the selfies.
And we think our suspect could be in one of these.
: Stop.
Right there, zoom in.
The guy with the package.
Run facial recognition.
(sizzling, chopping)
JJ, what are you doing here with the redfish?
Remember when you plate it, how did I teach you?
Diagonal right?
: Right.
Lots of butter.
Got it.
Keep the plates clean.
Excuse me, you're in the way of my amuse-bouche.
Amuse-bouche this.
We're federal agents. And, uh, we have you on camera delivering a very suspicious package to Zolfo's.
And ten minutes later, it went kablooey.
You think that I did that?
Well, I think your boss Flanders put you up to it.
Talk now, and we might cut you a deal.
I got nothing to say.
Well, we know you got a record.
Using and selling cocaine, heroin...
Keep it down, okay?
I'm clean now.
That's old news.
I've reinvented myself.
Oh, so is that why you've been missing your meetings with your probation officer?
Look, we can arrest you right now.
So why don't you just tell us what was in the box?
Hey, babies.
(squeaking quietly)
Rats?
You delivered rats?
Well, it's not about the rats, it's about the mites that are on the rats.
Please, just stop talking.
Health inspector detects them, shuts down the restaurant.
And Flanders had nothing to do it.
Come on.
We found his fingerprints on the packaging.
That's 'cause I got the package from his office.
Look, Flanders said that if he got Zolfo's, he'd make me the head chef.
Go big or go home, right?
(scoffs)
(sighs)
Wash your hands 'fore you go back in there.
Sebastian analyzed the package.
Significant traces of rat DNA.
: He give you anything else?
Not so far.
We'll start fresh in the morning.
(crackles)
Ah!
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
Just, uh... doing some electrical repairs at the bar.
Tell me about your day.
Did you make it to the server farm?
Yeah, only the place was cleaned out.
Nothing but empty offices.
Leasing company said the space was rented to something called Channel Industries, but no contact info for them at all.
Pride?
You there?
Sorry.
Mind went to the other case.
Too focused on Flanders and this mysterious package.
Haven't thought about other scenarios.
Yeah, well, you're a chef. I mean, you'd know better than anyone what went on in that kitchen.
Brody, you're brilliant.
Gotta go.
Glad I could help?
(knocking)
Meredith Brody? Agents Walker and Davis, FBI.
Need to come with us.
I'm NCIS.
We know who you are.
Please.
What are you doing?
Confiscating your computer.
Let's go, please. Now.
This must be a misunderstanding.
I need to call Director Vance.
(yawning loudly)
Sorry to keep you up so late, Sebastian.
But if we can figure out what Danielle was doing when the blast happened...
Figure out the source of the blast itself, I.D. the bomber. Let's do it.
Yeah, what do you got?
Uh, okay, so I determined that the shrapnel pulled from Danielle was made of steel and had traces of propane on it.
Steel and propane.
All right, well, to make bourbon steak, you gotta sear it.
All right, then you add the mushrooms, the bourbon...
And then to flambé it, you...
Cooking torch.
No, I got the, uh, the kitchen's cooking torch here somewhere.
Yeah.
There's... it's got a lot of smoke damage, but it didn't cause the blast.
How easy would it be to sabotage something like that?
Well, you just... got to crack the seal and then light it.
So... Ow!
Sebastian! You all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. I'm, uh, I'm okay, I'm okay.
I, uh...
All right, well...
I guess we know that a more powerful torch than this one caused the blast.
Pro chefs use industrial torches.
Danielle might have brought her own.
Do you remember that there was a, uh, a piece of shrapnel pulled from Danielle's body that had, uh, that had numbers on it?
Yeah.
Well, I matched it to another piece from the crime scene, and, uh...
Where is it?
Here, here.
“N-A-V-
I-H-eight...”
That's Navy requisition.
Danielle is a CS aboard the USS 
Well, someone on board could have sabotaged her torch before she left the ship.
This wasn't about the restaurant at all.
It's about Danielle.
She was the target.
(helicopter blades whirring)
: 
 to hurt CS Jarrett?
: Captain Estes, evidence suggests she was the target of a bombing.
The sabotaged torch she used came from your ship.
Removing equipment from the ship without permission is against regulation.
We have a serial number.
You said she moved up the ranks fast.
Maybe she stepped on someone's toes.
Jarrett was the best Culinary Specialist we've ever had.
Morale's been at an all-time high since she started cooking for the crew.
1,300 mouths to feed, three times a day.
It's 24/7 job and Jarrett was up for the task.
Everybody loved her.
Burke.
Sir?
CS Burke. He worked with Jarrett and has agreed to cooperate fully.
Burke, did you see Jarrett take a torch from the ship?
We're just trying to figure out who hurt her.
Yeah, she took a torch off ship.
But it was only because she was going to cook at her family's restaurant.
I watched her pull it from her locker myself, check it, and then leave.
Where's the locker?
This way, ma'am.
: Thanks.
Hmm.
“DRC”?
Deployed Resiliency Counselor.
It's resource for sailors to be able to speak anonymously with a counselor about any personal issues they may be having.
She share any “issues” with you?
No, but she seemed worried.
She's been making a lot of calls to shore on the POTS line past couple of days.
Always seems upset afterwards.
Whatever she was worried about, it doesn't seem to be about the ship.
You get the records of those calls?
Sonja's in the radio room now.
They're gonna get us a file.
As for DRC, Danielle never made an appointment with a counselor.
So she's making ship-to-shore calls, seems worried, no one knows why?
Yeah, it all boils down to who had access to that torch.
If it wasn't tampered with on board that ship, had to be on shore.
(car phone beeps)
That's the hospital.
Danielle's awake. I'm heading over.
: 
 on government property?
: I was investigating a company called Channel Industries.
Are you saying it's a government front?
We're asking the questions.
You're here because someone hacked into a server farm.
Look, I am here on an official NCIS investigation.
Contact Director Vance.
He give you permission to photograph this government facility?
This is Washington D.C.
Isn't that what people do?
Sorry I'm late.
John Russo, Homeland Security.
Well, I see you've been showing Special Agent Brody your patented FBI charm.
Sadly, we need her back.
This a Homeland Security operation.
Mmm.
: How come nobody notified us?
I'm notifying you now.
As well as your SAC.
Agent Brody came to D.C. under our authority.
She didn't mention it.
Maybe because you didn't ask nicely.
No need walking us out.
You want to tell me what this is about?
Yeah, I will. Just not right now.
Agents Butler and Lake will take you back to the Stanbridge.
I'll meet you at the hotel.
Wait a minute. How do you know where I'm staying?
Same way I knew you'd be here.
Believe me, DHS is just as interested in what happened to General Matthews as you are.
We'd just rather not involve the FBI for now.
Loose lips and all.
By the way, you're welcome.
: 
 my favorite shrimp and grits, and then a whole bunch of sweets from Willa Jean.
We can't have the brightest chef in the city eating hospital food.
We're gonna get you up and at 'em and cooking in no time, Danielle.
Thanks, John.
Smells awful good in here, Mr. Besh.
Hey, King, how are you?
Good, John.
Good seeing you.
Thanks for being here.
Oh, listen, thank you.
Danielle... I'm Special Agent Pride. NCIS. How you doing?
I'm okay.
Could I talk to you alone for a few minutes?
Yeah, sure.
Take care.
Okay.
Thanks, John.
We'll walk you out.
We'll be right outside, Danielle.
You always put on a brave face?
I'm a sailor.
You were also the target last night.
Someone sabotaged the torch you were using.
Can you think of anyone else who might have had access to it?
Just me.
Your co-worker said you are safety-conscious, so...
You went to the ship?
(sighs)
Captain Estes is going to take me to captain's mast for removing that thing.
Danielle, our forensic specialist said it looks like sabotage.
He a cook?
(chuckles)
Uh...
Tell me about DRC.
You were thinking about, uh, contacting a counselor?
Had something to do with some upsetting phone calls you were having.
That's none of your business.
It is if it has to do with why someone tried to kill you.
King, you know, I'm sorry.
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
I need to rest.
I hear you, Danielle.
So, uh... call me when you're ready, all right?
(gasps) Aah.
Sorry, hon.
It's just these collapsed veins of yours.
Just gonna be hard.
: 
Same thing you saw when Danielle was admitted.
Thoughts?
With the scarring on her arms, the most likely explanation is IV drug use.
See?
That doesn't look like anything recent.
Though I've seen more than one chef struggle with addiction.
Maybe she started using again, trying to get out of it.
Why she was considering DRC.
It's just hard to believe we're talking about the same girl I saw yesterday.
Hell-bent on catching a suspect.
Something changed when I told her she was the target.
Like she's protecting something.
Or someone.
I can pull Danielle's medical records for tox screens.
(phone beeps)
Ah, hang on a sec.
Oh, come on.
This is the price you pay for canceling with an electrician.
A six-hour window.
What? Don't they know people need to work?
It's a vast conspiracy.
Juggling act is what it is.
Work, bar, trying to keep an eye on Laurel.
Oh, I can relate.
CJ with three baseball leagues, Danny getting ready to graduate, me here at the job.
Yeah, we need help.
Um, no. 
 need help.
But doing it all on your own gives you a sense of control.
Fills the space.
(chuckling): Well, listen to you.
So what do we do about it?
Give each other a hug?
Drop out?
Tahiti maybe?
Say no more. I'm in.
(both chuckle)
All right, Brody.
Yeah, call me when you know more.
Merri okay?
Yeah.
May have a lead in the General Matthews case.
DHS connection.
Well, we may have a lead on Danielle as well.
Drug theory might be right.
Danielle was using again?
Emptied her bank account of 15K the morning she got here and called that burner phone three times before she took liberty.
None of that tells us who tried to kill her.
I might have something that could.
That was Captain Estes.
E-mailed secure recordings of the calls Danielle made to that burner phone.
: Play the most recent.
You got it.
(line ringing)
: Meet me under the Crescent City Bridge tomorrow.
: You have the cash?
: Yeah, I'll have it.
: Okay, all right, but just don't be late.
I don't want to get caught.
: I smell a rat.
Taylor.
Got a couple more questions for you.
Health Department already talked to me.
It's not about your pets, you idiot.
Nah, it's about your little meeting with Danielle.
Is this your stuff?
You don't need a search warrant for that?
No, 'cause I gave him permission 'cause this is my property and my reputation you're putting on the line here.
Well, look at what we have here.
Oh, baby, sugar and spice.
Taylor, stop!
Percy, I'm in the truck!
Get in!
Where is he?
: There he is. Alley.
All right.
All right, where'd he go?
No, I think we lost him.
Nah, check this out.
The hell are you doing?
Using the 360-degree camera.
Yeah, well, I still don't see him.
Yeah, he's got to be here somewhere.
Something under the dumpster there.
Does that look like a foot?
: You can run, but you can't hide.
Gotcha.
: 
It seems that you and Danielle have known each other for a while, used to cook at Raul's together back in the day.
Yeah, we worked the line together.
So what?
So you used to deal to her.
Why are you coming at me for this again?
Because you keep lying to us, all right?
You didn't tell us you met Danielle under the Crescent City Connection, and she gave you $15,000 in cash.
Come on, Taylor.
What happened, huh?
What made you turn on her?
Is she safe?
Uh, no, which is why you're sitting here, 'cause she got hurt.
She's at a hospital though, right?
So there's police or-or guards or something, right??
What are you trying to say, Taylor?
(sighs) All right, look, you got it wrong, okay?
Yeah, I used to sell to Danielle.
That was before the Navy though.
Sh-She's clean now.
But why meet up with her?
She needed my help.
That's what the money was for.
Hmm, so what kind of help does $15,000 get from someone like you?
Time-share in Boca Raton.
I have a cousin-- he's in the vacation business.
It was a cash deal.
You expect us to believe that?
(sighs)
Danielle, she wanted to disappear, okay?
She came to me trying to find a place where no one could get to her.
She was afraid of someone.
And I swear it was not me.
: 
 we have never met before.
You want to explain why you told the FBI we're working together?
General Matthews.
That's why you're here, right?
Someone leaked your case files to the news.
Ruined his career.
And his appointment to be my boss at Homeland Security.
You're investigating the leak too.
You got to try some of this.
No, no, no, they marinate the tri-tip in Dr. Pepper.
Come on.
I thought I was buying 
 dinner.
Saved you the receipt.
So what else you got?
Besides Channel Industries.
I know about Channel Industries, Brody.
Do you prefer Meredith?
Either one.
Brody.
Okay, Brody.
So what do you know about Channel Industries?
What do you know?
I know they're NSA.
Servers are backups for the declassified Intel.
Meaning they were easier to hack.
Suspect in the General Matthews leak (phone chimes) could have breached the servers, used them as a platform, then disappeared.
(clicks tongue)
You're almost right.
He didn't disappear.
My guys just got access to the Channel Industries server proxies.
(clears throat)
You mind?
No.
So what was the original IP address you traced back to the server farm?
Let's work together.
You give me the IP, my team gets the original location.
Boom.
We got him.
Glenn Franklin, part of the tech staff at Channel Industries.
Not exactly Dr. Evil, huh?
Let's go get him.
Let's do it.
(sirens wailing)
Federal agents with a warrant!
Homeland Security!
: Clear!
: Clear.
Suicide.
Oh, Pride, you're here.
That's so weird, I was just about to text you.
And then you, like, appeared.
You thinking the same thing I am, some kind of telepathy maybe?
Not telepathy, Sebastian; Loretta called me.
Oh, okay. Well, that would have been my second guess.
But hey, look. Um, I've been analyzing the seal on that torch.
Some kind of knife was used to tamper with it.
I was hoping maybe you could shed some light on it.
Put a pin in that one, Sebastian.
I've got something I need to talk to Pride about.
(door opens)
: You get Danielle's hospital records back?
I did, but I don't believe Danielle was hurt over drugs, Dwayne.
(phone chimes)
Hang on.
The electrician...
No!
Now...
You need help with the bar.
I know it's hard to give up.
Loretta...
Do it and consider that a nudge.
Now, like you say, “learn things”
I looked into Danielle's medical history to see if there was any drug abuse.
I needed her family's records for comparison.
Found these.
Emergency room visits for broken bones, concussions, cuts.
Accidents in Zolfo's kitchen.
Well, that's what the ER Admission says, but... take a look at these injuries.
Also, this isn't Danielle's medical records, they're her mother's.
Danielle's step-father, Blake, filled out the forms.
(chuckles) Every one of them.
Pride, I think he was abusing Elaine, and Danielle got in the way.
Most recent fall, week ago.
Day after that, Danielle started making calls to a burner phone.
Condo, draining her bank account, thinking about talking to the DRC.
All for Elaine.
Why didn't either one of them say something?
Well, that's why victims of abuse are always quiet, because of finances, religion.
In this case, maybe the restaurant's reputation.
Or Elaine just couldn't get out from underneath his thumb.
And despite the physical pain, she may still love and fear him.
That's what abusers do.
That's where their power lies.
(phone chimes)
(sighs)
No, no, I got to get this one.
It's the hospital.
Pride.
Agent Pride, it's Danielle.
I need to talk to you.
Danielle, you all right?
(dial tone ringing)
What is it?
I'll let you know.
(sirens wailing)
Oh, Agent Pride.
What happened?
Oh, my God.
Well, the doctors think that it's her pain meds.
That her IV, some kind of overdose.
(crying): I only left for a second.
It's okay, honey. She's gonna make it.
It's okay.
(monitors beeping steadily)
Nurse said Blake was in the room with Danielle.
Called the doctor when she stopped breathing.
(sighs) Can't we just take him in for questioning?
Elaine's word against his.
Then we need to talk to her.
Well, she hasn't turned on him yet.
Hasn't even asked anybody for help.
Maybe she just needs a little nudge.
I'm gonna talk to her.
Blake leaves, follow him.
Agent Pride.
Danielle's stable, thank God.
That's good news.
Listen, we, uh... we need to talk.
Okay, well, let me just get Blake.
Well, this is more of a you and me conversation.
I, uh, I need to show you something.
Why are you showing me an X-ray of my arm?
Because it's one of the many things Blake's done to you over the years.
Oh, no. This was an accident.
You kept it from Danielle at first, didn't you?
Want to protect her, didn't want her to worry.
Accidents, they're all accidents.
But after the last time Blake hit you...
I fell.
That's not what you told Danielle last Monday.
She wanted to get you away from Blake.
He found out.
He-he tampered with her torch.
Not possible.
I know this must be difficult.
You have no idea.
Blake loves me.
This isn't love.
Please.
If you don't help, he might try and hurt Danielle again.
We need you, Elaine.
Danielle needs you.
How?
I can barely help myself, (crying): how can I possibly help my daughter?
By being just as strong as she is.
(sobbing)
Hello, Blake.
Elaine.
Sanctuary.
That's what this place has always meant to me.
Do you remember when I first brought you here?
Oh, you-you loved looking at the pictures of my family, New Orleans.
All the history.
“If these walls could talk...” you said.
(voice-breaking): If these walls could talk...
Elaine...
(chuckles) What's going on?
Would they tell me why you would want to hurt Danielle?
What are you talking about?
You asked her to cook the night of the bombing.
You never wanted her around.
Blake, you encouraged her to go into the Navy.
It was the best thing that ever happened to her.
Straightened her life out.
Gave her strength.
The courage to help me get away from you.
What happened? How'd you find out?
I overheard her talking to you about the condo.
She tried to take you away from me.
So you tried to blow her up?
Wasn't like that.
She just needed to be taught a lesson.
Like you taught me?
Pushing me, hitting me?
Accidents, Elaine.
Accidents that were your fault.
(crying): You are a fraud and a monster.
What did you call me?
(screams)
Step away from her now!
Leave her alone!
: Put your hands up.
Get 'em up.
: Turn around now.
Double cuffs, King.
You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Danielle Jarrett.
Let's go.
You did good.
For yourself.
And for your daughter.
Hm.
Sounds like everything worked out.
: Best it could.
How about you?
Did you electrocute yourself again?
(chuckles) No.
I can't do it on my own anymore.
I'm gonna hire a general manager.
Help me with the bar.
Great. Baby steps, right?
Something like that.
Got your e-mail.
Our suspect in General Matthews' case turns out to be another suicide?
Left a note and everything.
Admitted to the leak, said he did it alone.
Doesn't sound like you buy it.
(knocking)
Do you?
Not really.
Come on back home.
We'll hash it out.
See you soon.
Agent Russo.
Hi.
Hi.
Was hoping you hadn't left.
Wanted to offer you a ride.
Oh, I've got a cab waiting downstairs.
Send him away. Come with me.
(chuckles) Why would I do that?
Protection.
Oh, God knows the kind of trouble you can get into on the way to the airport.
(chuckling): Thank you, but I will...
I will take my chances.
Okay.
You have my number.
Yeah.
I do.

Sounding good.

Wow.
(indistinct conversations)
Well, looks like somebody's open for business again.
(Danielle chuckles)
Still got a little healing to do, but with help from friends like you, and the Navy, we're gonna be okay.
I think you're gonna be okay too.
Thank you for everything, Agent Pride.
You're welcome.
Let us know if you need anything, all right?

: Hey, Dwayne. How about helping out the rest of the team here? What do you think?
Come on, John. Why are you piling on me like that?
Come on.
Great to see you.
You too.
Unless you already have enough on your plate.
No, never too much for you, Susan.
Always.
All right.
Who else you bring?
Ms. Leah.
How are you?
I'm well, what you got going?
It smells so good.
Red beans and rice, Woo! and fried chicken.
Nice.
That is good.
Thank you so much.
Man, we got the best of the best of the chefs in New Orleans cooking for us right here, huh?
Yes, sir, we do.
(whoops)
Hey, Pride, why don't you tell Percy here how good deconstructed cuisine is.
Ugh.
Did you say cuisine?
Yeah.
Uh, reconstruct it, okay?
I don't get going to a restaurant if they're not gonna put my food together.
By separating the flavors, you give the palate an opportunity...
To enjoy more of the flavors.
That's what I tried to tell her.
: Exactly.
: Thank you, Pride.
(Pride chuckles)
We're gonna turn you into a foodie yet.
We both are.
Well, I'm already a foodie.
A vegan foodie.
(laughter)
