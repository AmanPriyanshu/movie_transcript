Where's your partner, detective?
Following up a lead on another case.
Bureau's been tracking Dominic's crew ever since a corrupt DEA agent was found with a bullet in her head, and Elias put him away only to lose him again.
FBI's Ten Most Wanted, that was quite a takedown by you and your partner.
Yeah, it sure was.
But then your transport van gets T-boned by a dump truck, and both of them wind up dead.
The whole thing went down in a black hole.
There's not a single surveillance camera in sight.
Yeah, that's, uh, interesting.
We've gone over the crime scene, and something doesn't add up.
Dominic was found 15 feet from the van, shot through the head.
Right.
You can read that in my report.
But there's no evidence of another shooter.
You just tell us, detective, did you pull your weapon?
[gasps]
I drew my weapon, but I never fired.
Look, I know this sounds crazy, but the shot sounded like it came from a high-powered rifle on a nearby rooftop.
A sniper?
Are you telling us it was a grassy knoll, detective?
We've got two dead kingpins on our hands on your watch, and you're telling me that you pulled your weapon but didn't fire?
Look, that's what I'm telling you.
[solemn music]
We're gonna need your weapon, detective.
Haven't been on one of these since Elias got the better of us.
I'm not particularly fond of them either.
Well, we got to get off-camera, find our way back to the subway.
There'll be more operatives on the other side.
We're living in a Samaritan world now.
What are we dealing with here, Finch?
Uncharted waters, Mr. Reese. It's everywhere.
Pervasive, surveillance, misinformation, propaganda, and they can activate almost anyone.
So what's the damage?
The red light means that the piezoelectric battery must have been damaged.
I thought this case was indestructible.
The case may be, but the brain inside it can only just take so much blunt force trauma, not unlike us.
Sorry, I was short on Kevlar.
Damage to a single bit of the code of the Machine in its presently compressed state would equal terabytes of lost data.
Irretrievable, irreparable.
It's running now on the lithium-ion backup, but if that light starts blinking, we're in big trouble.
Our best hope is to get back to the subway and try to stabilize it.
Even then, I'm not sure I can fix the battery, much less decompress the Machine.
It would take vast amounts of processing power, which I don't currently have available.
Don't worry. We'll find Root.
She'll help you get it back up and running.
Then we'll get Shaw back, start working the numbers again.
Mr. Reese, we don't even know if the Machine that comes out will be the same one that went in.
It might be mortally wounded.
You don't know that.
We'll fix it.
We have to, Finch.
The world needs your Machine now more than ever.
You're not the first person that's tried to tell me that, Mr. Reese.
And had I known what we'd be up against now, I might have handled things differently.
[indistinct voices chattering]
Why, yes, I did. Thank you for asking.
What loss?
You look flush, Harold.
What, did the Machine ask you out on a date?
[chuckles]
I think there's a bug in the code.
The Machine is becoming a bit... presumptuous, intuitive, clever, voracious even.
Its burgeoning intelligence is a little unsettling.
Spoken like a true parent.
You should be proud, Harold.
I mean, you have created a true artificial intelligence.
I endeavored to create a machine that would serve, not supersede, us.
A supercomputer that can think 100,000 times faster than the smartest human is automatically a potential threat.
Once it surpasses us, we would be foolish to imagine that we had the means to control it.
If an unbridled artificial super intelligence ever saw us as a threat, it-- it could lead to the extinction of mankind.
Oh, easy, Professor Doom and Gloom.
Why do you assume it'll be hostile?
It could be friendly.
Hell, if it even has the slightest sense of human compassion, it could cure cancer, solve global warming.
It could eradicate poverty with ease.
Or it could do exactly the opposite.
Create total chaos.
I'm sorry.
It's an existential risk that the world cannot afford, Nathan.
And there's only one way to ensure that it doesn't come to that.
Which is?
Contain its growth.
Clear its RAM every day at midnight.
You mean erase its memories?
That sounds cruel.
Memories make up who we are.
I know that.
My father died of Alzheimer's 25 years ago today, but his real death happened well before that, when he lost all his memories.
And now you want to do the same thing to your brainchild.
We're not talking about us, Nathan.
We're talking about a machine.
Well, it sounds like you're trying to convince yourself, Harold.
Someone one day is going to create an uninhibited ASI.
It's not a matter of if but when.
Why shouldn't it be you?
Unless, of course, you trust someone else to build one that will be friendly towards humankind.

This is private property. You're trespassing.

Why are you here?
I'm looking for a man named Bela.
There's no one here by that name.
Bela Durchenko.
He hacked a Russian kleptocrat six years ago, stole a hundred million.
The Russians sent a team of FSB agents to make sure he never made it out of Russia alive, so Bela hired an online hacker/assassin to take out the Russian first, then escaped to Latvia, never heard from again... till now.
And how did you find me?
Same way I found the Russian.
That's why you hired me.
Hello, Bela.
Hello, Root.
Nice to finally meet you.
: As you know, detective, witnesses involved in motor vehicle accidents often experience head trauma and as a result can present dramatically different version of events than the evidence suggests.
Look, I know what you're thinking here, but I was there, and I'm telling you--
Ballistics came back from the FBI lab.
It was your weapon, detective.
[foreboding music]
We believe the crash vehicle was one of Dominic's men attempting to spring him from custody.
Dominic stole a guard's weapon, and when he tried to escape, you shot him.
That's not how I remembered it--
You stopped one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted from fleeing the scene.
And when he turned on you, it became self-defense.
You're a hero, detective.
Let me take a look at that.
Sorry.
This is a federal case now.
FBI's recommending you for commendation.
Commendation?
Good work, detective.
Battery's damaged.
I'm gonna have to improvise an alternative power supply to keep the RAM chips alive.
So what can I do to help?
I believe you've done quite enough, Mr. Reese.
Okay, then, I'll head back out for Root.
John.
It's too risky now.
Given our recent clashes with operatives throughout the city, we have no idea whether our cover identities still hold.
You know we don't leave our comrades behind.
The numbers won't wait.
Good luck, Harold.
It's just you and me now.
Though I seem to have a unique talent for alienating the people I employ, I'm not prepared to lose either of you just yet.

Oh, hello.
Hey.

Who's a good boy?

Oh, no thanks.
Whoa, I have never known you to turn down ice cream.
Something on your mind, Harold?
It's nothing. Just a work decision.
I think I might have to let an employee go.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's extremely talented, resourceful, innovative, but just too...
He seems constantly to have boundary issues.
Sounds personal.
Sounds more like a-- a protégé.
Suppose I am a mentor of sorts.
Perhaps the student has outgrown the teacher.
Could be time to push him out of the nest, set him free.
My mind is telling me to do one thing and my heart another.
Well, you've come to rely upon him.
Perhaps if he didn't remind me of it all the time.
Mmm.
It's hard to let good people go.
And I know you're not the type to take other people's feelings lightly, Harold, but that's what I like about you.
You've got a good heart. Go with it.
It won't steer you wrong.
What?
Oh, it's nothing. It's just--
That was something that my father always used to say.

 most elite assassin was taken out by the so-called "man in the suit," but I always figured you were too clever to be done in by some gun-for-hire.
: Just needed a change.
Got a new job. Fell in love.
What are you really doing here?
They had numbers. I needed a place of refuge.
So you bring them all the way to my place of business.
Knew you'd defend your turf.
You didn't disappoint.
Who is chasing you?
Because it's not law enforcement.
Do I have a problem?
They were after me, not you.
Besides, you operate in a shadow zone.
Cameras are liabilities, easily hacked or used against you in court of law.
Only the paranoid survive.
Ah.
Another reason I came to you.
I need a new identity, and you're the best.
What makes you think I'm still in that business?
You're a hacker, Bela.
You're not here to make a buck off recycling.
Your minions are mining personal data off that old equipment, which can only mean you're committing identity theft.
We're finding some malware baked deep into the latest firmware, impossible to reformat.
Just reinstalls every time it's booted up.
We think it's the NSA.
NSA still doesn't know you're in this country, thanks to me.
I just need a new identity, Bela.

Then we'll call it even.
I'll see what I can work out... for an old friend.

Ah! Ah.
Since when did the feds stop sharing ballistics reports?
Since the NYPD lost two of our most wanted RICO targets.
You don't like it, take it up with your boss.
Lionel.
Nice of you to join us, detective.
How was your vacation?
Bumpy. Problem with my luggage.
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.
I just got T-boned, shot at by a sniper, hammered in the box by IAB and the feds, but enough about me.
Agreed.
Now, did you find anything on those incident reports?
All the significant department incident reports for the last 24 hours.
Mm-hmm. Anything jump out at you?
Outside of a nutjob assault on a subway, otherwise known as a Wednesday in New York, nothing.
That's Root. Thanks, Lionel.
Hey, we need to talk about what's going down around here.
You haven't heard the half of it yet.
Would you keep your voice down?
They said I fired my weapon, killed Dominic, which is insane because I was there.
I'm telling you, it wasn't me.
And I believe you.
Well, they don't.
Then this fed pulls a ballistics report out of his ass, says it was my gun.
And what did you say?
I went along with it, like you said.
Agreed I was banged up and must have blocked it out.
Now they're making it out to look like it was a good shooting.
So you're a hero.
Good job, Lionel.
Next guy that tells me "Good job, Lionel" is gonna get fed his teeth.
