Wonderful, Colin. Thank you.
Wonderful.
Colin, you'll have my foot tapping all the way through my sermon now.
(ALL CHUCKLE)
Wonderful.
(CLEARS THROAT) What is the Baptist church?
It is not this building, it is this community, and church members commit not only to extend Christ's kingdom, but to Love one another and support one another, whatever the cost.
(PANTS)
Ohh.
Daddy's back.
Wash. Wash, wash, wash, wash.
Look, you stink like a wet dog.
Some mothers-to-be get a hand in the morning, don't you know? Come on, eat up.
I've made you packed lunch.
Lauren's one?
Yes.
Sandwiches?
Yes.
Ohh. Ah.
Ham and cheese?
Yes.
I'll take them to school.
Does Daddy even know the way?
Probably not.
You should've finished your breakfast by now. I'm done. Good boy.
Five minutes. Have them ready or we'll be late. Yes, sir!
: Yes, sir!
(CHUCKLES)
Matthew, what are you doing at school today?
Maths, English, work, lunch.
Morning, Mrs Buchanan. Morning.
Morning. Hello, Lauren.
You dropping off, that's a surprise.
I'm full of surprises, eh?
See you later.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
(PHONE NAMES)
Morning, Mr Howell.
Morning.
Your father-in-law's here.
Right.
Good morning, Harry.
Morning.
(CHUCKLES) Well, you've done the place up beautifully, son.
With your kind help, Harry. Come in.
Ah.
Morning. Thank you.
Take his coat, will you?
Thank you.
Here, sit yourself down in a state-of-the-art ergonomic chair. Oh.
Oh, yeah, and the piece de resistance.

He needs picking up before seven, I'm telling ya.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Oh, here she is. You two are in trouble now, aren't yous?
Hi.
All right, love?
Did you get anything nice in town?
Well, I got some buns.
Some buns. Did you hear that, you two? She's got some buns. Yay!
But you'll not be getting any unless you finish your dinner. Quit playing with it.
Hey, is your daddy letting you play with your food?
Yes, he is.
Nothing to do with me.
Eat your dinner, eat it up.
What time are you going out?
Er, what time's Jeanette coming?
Half-six?
Sorry, love?
Yeah, half-six. Is my dress still all right for tonight?
Mummy'd look great even if she put a sack on, wouldn't she?
Yes. Yes.
Can we afford a sack?
(CHILDREN GIGGLE)
Come on, you two, hurry up.
What?
Colin's moving up in the world, eh?
You're very welcome.
Hilary, in you go, Tess is in there.
Good evening, Constable. Evening, Colin. How's you?
Good, good.
Hazel, how are you?
Fine, thank you.
Pastor. Evening, Colin.
You're very welcome.
And what do we feel about worldly wealth?
Did King Solomon really need 666 talents of gold each year and all those Chariots?
And 700 wives.
(ALL CHUCKLE)
Yes, but of course the real point here is that Solomon didn't ask God for wealth, only wisdom.
Proverbs Three, 15 to 14. 'Happy is the man that findeth wisdom for the merchandise and gain thereof are finer than gold.”
And gold, yes, quite, and God made him the wisest judge of all time. Indeed.
(ENGINE CHUGS)
(CHILDREN CHATTER AND GIGGLE)
Are you feeling all right?
Yeah, good. just tired, you know?
It used to take me half an hour to roll over.
My back, too.
I've got awful lower back pain.
(SEAGULLS CALL)
(BELL CLANGS)
Oh, you're a big boy.
Have fun.
Come on, Lauren, we'll go see Granddad. Thank you.
There's Granddad. Go on.

Are you ready?
I want you to stand up as well.
Good girl. Well done. l Come over this way.
Feet on, feet on.
Look, what's that over there?
Oh.
(GIGGLING)
Are you not getting back in?
Huh. I'm a hopeless swimmer.
Come on, let me see.
You fibber. You're far from hopeless.
I just can't do the crawl.
The crawl?
Right.
Stretch... Grab the rail.
Both hands, stretch out. Stretch out, I'll show you. (CHUCKLES)
The secret to the crawl...
Mm-hm?
...is you have to make your feet flexible.
Like fins, see?
OK.
Fins. OK.
Whilst your legs, they remain straight and taut, scissoring you through the water.
OK, everybody, put your hands above the water.
I'm not having innocent thoughts about you, Hazel.
Maybe I'm not so innocent myself.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Hi.
Come in.
Right. Um...
Are you ready for your next lesson?
Yeah.
Are you gonna tell me you're hopeless at this, too?
I am.
You look...
Oh, thanks.
So let's go back to the beginning.
This is C, remember?
There.
Third there, fourth there.
Oh, that hurts.
Where?
That one.
Oh, yeah.
It's because the strings are just digging into you.
You need to toughen that up. Um...
OK, try that.
(STRUMS TUNELESSLY)
Oh... (BOTH LAUGH)
That's just, um...
Don't collapse your ring finger because that deadens the sound.
Try now.
(STRUMS)
Not bad. It's good.
See? You hear a chord there.
Yeah.
No, it was good. Right, we'll try and go to G minor
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Oh, there's Constable Buchanan himself. Trevor. Trevor, how are you?
Evening, Colin. Not bad. Yourself?
Good, good.
I wasn't expecting to see you.
' No, listen, it's time I went.
I wasn't expecting to see you.
Um, that's great for the first go.
Don't be letting me disturb yous now.
No, no, she shows potential.
All right, love?
I'm getting good.
I'm out. Very good. Hazel.
Thanks, Colin.
Regards to your wife, Colin.
Of course.
Thanks, Trevor.
Are you all right?
Do you want a cup of tea?
That'd be great, yeah. Thanks.
(DOOR SHUTS)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Mm-hm.
OK, that's you done.
Thanks, Colin.
(LOUD WHIRRING)
(RADIO COMMENTARY)
If they remember.
Are you all right?
Come on.
(ENGINE STARTS)
Are you all ready to go?
Yes.
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
(CUTLERY CLATTERS)
(GASPS)
What just happened?
Do you want me to explain it to you?
It was something beautiful.
No. No, it was something sinful.
God's wishes are important.
This beautiful thing wouldn't have happened unless He wanted it to.
Do you really believe that?
This is God's gift.
It would be wrong to refuse it.
(GENTLE CLATTER)
(SHOES SQUEAK)
Hi. Can't sleep?
Did you have a good night?
Ah, well, the same old, same old, you know?
See you in a second.
(CLOCK TICKS)
Mmm...
Mm...
(TAPS IN NUMBERS)
(DING)
(CLICK)
(TAPS IN NUMBERS)
(BLEEPS)
Hello.
I think you've got the wrong number.
(GIGGLES) Don't be cruel.
'I can't sleep. Can you sleep?'
'No.'
'Not a wink.'
'(GIGGLES)'
'Shh. You'll wake the house.'
'The children are dead to the world.'
'oh, I can't wait to see you.'
'Me, too. When?'
'When can you get away? Trevor's on nights next weekend! I don't know if I can wait that long. How about you?'
(GIGGLES)
'Me, neither.'
It's impossible to believe, another one on the way. Oh, right.
See you in five or six months.
Cheerio.
Hello, Colin.
Pastor.
A quick word, Colin. It's a church matter. Could we go in there?
Please, no, come in.
Oh, it's changed a bit since you were last here. It certainly has.
It's spanking new, isn't it?
Mm-hm.
Listen. Colin, um...
Yes.
Well, these things are always difficult, and difficult to broach.
Someone from the church has come to me and said that you are...
...involved in an inappropriate relationship with Hazel Buchanan.
I'm a faithful husband and a committed Christian.
Lesley is about to bear me a fourth child with the Lord's blessing.
We cannot allow adulterers to remain in the Baptist church.
The church and my family are my life.
I give you my word. Nothing improper has happened with Hazel.
That's...
I'm glad to hear that, Colin.
Please - You're all right.
I'll see myself out, thank you.
Thank you, Pastor.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)
(DOORHANDLE RATTLES)
Look, give me a minute. Sorry.
(CHATTERING AND LAUGHTER)
I was feeling trapped.
Colin is so...
...everything that Trevor isn't.
Colin has a wife...
...and you have a husband.
Have this.
Take it. (SOBS)
(WHISPERING VOICES)
Now, Colin, I've spoken with the other party.
I know the truth.
Tell me, Colin.
Now rejoice not in iniquity but in the truth... Colin.
I wish to confess...
No...
..before God and before you...
..to being unfaithful.
(SOBS)
Who with?
When?
Hazel Buchanan.
No!
Adultery.
Adultery.
You... Aaargh!
How could you?! Lesley.
I'm carrying your child!
No, no, Lesley. No, no.
(CHAIR SCRAPING)
Lesley, where are you... where are you at? What have you been thinking?
I don't want a divorce.
I'll do anything I can to keep us all together.
First, the First Book of John.
Um, Chapter One, Verse Nine.
'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just and will forgive us... (CAR HORN) ..our... our sins, and purify us from all...
Unrighteousness.
..unrighteousness...'
I have admitted my sin.
And I love my family.
I love the church.
This will never happen again.
Now, Lesley, it is your duty, as a wife,...
...to do all in your power to keep your husband happy.
And as a husband and head of house, you must strive also to inspire your wife in every way.
So in the eyes of the church, I am I as much to blame for the infidelity?
No, but marriage is a sacred bond by which the flesh is united.
Look, whatever you've done, I'll always love you.
Oh, Trevor, I'm so sorry.
I don't deserve you.
Until that bond is fully restored, the church must make clear its displeasure before the Lord.

Cohn?
Colin!
Sorry.
(SWITCHES OFF)
Please forgive me, Trevor.
I forgive you.
(DISTANT SIREN)
Thank you, Pastor.
Well done.
Well done.
And we'll be admitting you all back into the flock...
...now that there are no feelings between you and Hazel any more.
She says she's doing well...
...and moving on.
I'm glad to hear that, Pastor.
(DOOR SHUTS)
(DING)
Huh...
(DOOR CREAKS OPEN GENTLY)
(DIALS)
Hazel?
What are you doing calling me?
You?
Hello, Trevor.
You're out late tonight.
Can you ID this man?
Aye.
Aye, he's all right.
On your way, on you go.
You're mad. Go home.
No. (GIGGLES)
Here, allow me.
Do I look OK?
Mm-hm.
I got you some more.
(BLISTER PACKAGING RATTLES)
Do you find they're helping?
Mm-hm.
Matthew? Lauren?
Who's this glamorous lady, eh?
It's Mummy.
You Look Lovely, Mummy.
Oh, thank you.
The handsome couple.
Give us a couple of minutes, darling.
I'll get the car.
(RATTLING)
Will you tell me what's wrong, Les?
It's nothing.
If the marriage is not working...
But the children adore him.
He helps me clothe and feed them.
I'll see you later.
(BABBLING STREAM)
(SNIFFS)
I'll have the baby and tell Trevor it's his.
We can't do that.
Why?
Because I will claim any child that is mine.
So I'll ask him for a divorce then, tonight?
Divorce would mean my banishment from the Baptist community. Oh. And yours. Oh.
Divorce is failure.
It's sin.
Oh, and abortion isn't?
OK.
Listen.
Lesley and I have already committed that sin.
What?
Abortion.
She had three abortions.
Before we got married.
Really?
I know a place.
It's gonna be all right.
I'm sorry I snapped.
Dad, where's Mummy?
What?
Where's Mummy? I'm hungry.
Are you all right?
Thanks for coming.
(SNIFFS) Do you think it matters if people see... see us together?
Us two have nothing to hide.
Are you gonna be all right for now?
You know, with the wee ones an' all?
Do you think...
Do you think they've gone for good?
(DISTANT DOG BARKS)
I don't care where you've been and I don't care what you've been doing.
You've come back for us and for the kids, and that's all that matters.
You don't look well, pet.
Come on to bed.
Come on.
(LOUD SPLASHING)
Where the hell were you?
London. I told you.
Did she go with you?!
Did she?!
Was she there?
Please, please finish with her, this is our last chance.
Don't you care about our children?
Don't I care for them?
I provide for them.
I provide for you.
Yes, your wife, a proper wife, who is faithful to you and stands by you.
Why can't you be a proper husband?
Who are you calling that...bitch?
Is that her? Answer me...
(GLASS SHATTERS)
Lesley.
(VOICE BREAKS) This is what you've done to me, our marriage, our children.
(BABY CRIES)
(NEWSREADER OVER TV)
No. Lesley?
Lesley?
Go away.
(EXHALES)
(SEAGULLS CALL)
(WAVES LAP)
It was Diana's favourite.
Fit for a princess.
I'm getting sand in my shoes.
I want us to live our whole lives together.
Me too.
But you'll stay in that marriage just so as you can stay in our church.
I don't see any way we can be to ether.
Don't give up hope.
God will guide us.
I'm sorry.
I'm so happy you could come and stay.
That's fine.
Sorry the place is such a mess.
You make a fine mother, Les.
Let no man say otherwise.
Lesley... Les?
Mmm.
Maybe this'll help?
Dad, what is this?
Freedom.
But it's...
It's so...generous, but I can't.
It's yours.
I've lived my life and you need to live yours.
Open a new account, your name only.
Thank you.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
I have something to tell you.
Ah, you never stop.
What?
As of now, me and the children are financially independent.
My father's taken care of us.
He's been...very generous.
And you won't get a penny.
Listen -
This is not how a Christian wife should behave.
And how should a Christian husband behave?
You disgust me.

Lesley?
Get out.
Get out!
I just never wanna wake up.
(DOOR SHUTS)
(BIRDS CALL)
If you were to leave Trevor...
...to be with me...
...would he survive it?
What?
Would he want to go on living?
He said he'd die if I left.
What about Lesley?
(SIGHS)
She's lost the will to live.
If she and Trevor were to die,...
...the children could have no better parents than you and me.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Now what if we could help them?
What?
End their suffering.
(CROW CAWS)
Humanely.
You're mad.
That'd never work.
How would you get away with that?
We.
