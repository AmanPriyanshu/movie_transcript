Editor: 
Alvin's spread in "Vanity Fair" was awesome.
I've had it on my Pinterest since it came out.
[chuckles] Alvin is the best.
You can change in here, Sally.
♪ ♪
Can I call Matt?
He usually likes to be with me.
Alvin doesn't like boyfriends or managers around.
It keeps it more intimate.
Okay.
[door clicks]
Hello, gorgeous.
Today, we are gonna make magic.
Are we really doing this?
I have, like, 500 shots on my phone.
Well, you can text those, but you need some that you can frame.
Yeah, plus this light, Rollins, you can't beat magic hour.
Listen to him. He gets a camera, and all of a sudden, he's a professional.
Hey, you saw those shots I took of my niece.
All right, you say magic hour, I say witching hour.
I've got, like, ten minutes.
[bell rings]
Hold on, sweetie, okay?
All right, baby, here we go.
Here we go. Hold on, sweetie boy.
Hold on. Ready?
Yeah.
Oh, Lou, Lou, that's...
That's incredible.
[camera shutter clicking]
There you go. Hey, Jesse, right here.
[camera shutter clicking]
That's it. You know you want it.
Oh, beautiful. All right.
Gorgeous!
That is hot.
That is sexy.
Move to your right a little bit. Good, baby, good.
Okay, good, good.
Get down, yeah.
That's it. Lick your lips.
Wet, I want it wet.
Baby, give it to me!
I love it!
Come on, this down...
Hey, hey, what are you doing? Don't...
I'm trying to get something.
I'm gonna go change lenses.
Nora!
Get her to chill.
He's intense, but it's worth it.
I just haven't done shoots like this before.
Well, you're fresh, and that's why he's really responding to you.
If Alvin is into you...
[whispers] Then it's all good.
Give it to me.
Give it to me!
Wait, wait.
Just take it...
[grunting] My little girl.
[moaning]
[crying]
[moaning]
[moans]
That was amazing.
[crying]
That worked.
Did you get all of it?
Oh, good stuff.
Go... go clean her up.
I didn't want him to do that.
That's not what the camera saw.
[crying]
[phone ringing] Whoa!
Yeah. Benson.
A 17-year-old girl?
Okay, is she in with the nurse now?
Okay, see you in about 30 minutes.
So much for magic hour.
I was in Alvin Gilbert's loft.
He was taking pictures, and then he asked me to take off my top, started touching me, and then he pushed me down to the floor.
Okay, and then what happened?
I was begging him.
I said, "Please, don't do this to me," and that's when he handed the camera to Nora, his assistant.
Hold up. His assistant was there?
Okay, did she see the assault?
Yes.
She was taking pictures.
She took pictures of the rape?
Rape?
Yes, Sally, rape.
That's what we could be charging him with.
Charges?
Please, I don't know if I want to press charges.
My boyfriend, Matt, he doesn't know that I was there, and if he finds out, he will kill me.
[dramatic music]
♪ ♪
How was the training at Quantico?
I can neither confirm nor deny I was there.
Okay.
Sorry I left you guys in the lurch.
We managed.
You caught a case last night?
Yeah, Sally Landry, 17.
She was reluctant to press charges, but we convinced her to come in.
She's an aspiring model.
She is fresh off the bus from Iowa.
She's here for Fashion Week.
Fashion week... I hate it.
Yeah, me too. A nonstop gridlock.
Anyway, Sally was raped by Alvin Gilbert in his studio yesterday.
Alvin Gilbert the fashion designer?
No, that's... that's his older brother, Benno.
Alvin is the bad boy photographer that does all their photo shoots, campaign design.
A real bad boy... me and Munch caught that case 12 years ago.
Really, what happened?
Some big-time Italian model got assaulted during a shoot.
While we were investigating, she becomes the face of their new perfume.
Hmm.
Case goes away.
I'm not sure this one will.
Sally's green, she's very upset, and Alvin's assistant, Nora Wattan, may have taken pictures of the assault.
So the rape kit did come back positive for semen, so we're running it now for DNA.
And Sally's blood alcohol was high because Nora was feeding her drinks.
Do the Gilberts know that she disclosed?
Oh, I doubt it.
As of last night, she didn't even want her boyfriend to know.
Let me do the talking.
[whispers indistinctly]
Is that her?
Yep, from that choke hold that guy's got on her, I'm guessing he knows.
Sally.
Hey, how you doing today?
Okay.
This is my boyfriend, Matt.
Lieutenant Benson.
Matt Kroger, boyfriend and manager.
I warned Sally about this Gilbert creep.
Uh, okay, Mr. Kroger.
Um...
Right now, we need to speak with Sally.
That's why I'm here.
Let's do this.
You know what? She'll be okay.
Why don't you come with me and Detective Carisi?
Yeah, just come for a minute. It's fine.
Okay.
Talk to us about this piece of crap.
We're just gonna go in this room right here.
I had to tell Matt.
When I came home, he could tell that something was wrong.
And how'd he handle it?
Matt's angry, not at me, at Alvin.
Yeah, Sally, that bruise under your eye, that... that wasn't there last night.
Well, um, that must be from the assault.
But you were worried about how Matt would react.
No, Matt has been very understanding.
Okay.
And have you called anyone from your family?
I don't really talk to them anymore.
Um, well, Sally, we have to ask you.
You're new, right, in the business?
And Alvin's a pretty famous photographer.
Is there anything that may have happened that you didn't want to tell us or didn't want to tell Matt?
Wait, you guys think I'm making this up?
I-I-I wouldn't.
Alvin Gilbert raped me.
Just a question, Sally. We just have to ask.
I discovered Sally in Dubuque, behind the counter at Cold Stone Creamery.
I got her pictures. I made the connects.
I go with her to every gig until this guy Alvin cuts me out.
That's tough.
No, she's too trusting.
And I've spoken to her about this.
Be that as it may, I can't guard her 24-7.
No, of course not.
So you know, Alvin is not gonna get away with this.
Well, we're gonna do everything we can...
No, I mean no matter what.
If you don't take care of him, I will.
And Nora brought you another drink, and then Alvin resumed shooting?
Yeah.
That's when he started to get really physical with me, and then he got on top of me, and I was struggling, saying, "Wait."
Hold on, and Nora's still shooting?
Yes.
I was fighting to get him off of me, and she just kept saying how hot I looked.
[knocks]
Uh, excuse me one moment, Sally.
Hey, you got something?
I ran Matt Kroger through the system.
Domestic violence, assault charges.
Why am I not surprised?
Look, I know we're supposed to take every Vic's story at face value, but what if this gets spun that Sally consented with Alvin to help her career?
And she's claiming rape to avoid a beatdown from Matt?
Yeah.
That's why we need a controlled meet.
With Alvin?
He just assaulted her. You think she can handle that?
No.
No, I don't.
What happened in Alvin's studio, it wasn't right.
Morning-after regret.
Don't.
You're gonna get a lot of work from this.
Alvin is definitely gonna use you.
He didn't use a condom.
What are you saying here, Sally?
I'm worried that I might be pregnant.
If you are, Alvin will take care of it.
Is this a shakedown?
No.
Because if you're gonna take on the House of Gilbert, your career's over.
What about those photos that you took?
What happens if those wind up all over the Internet?
Relax.
They're not even on the computer.
They're on a separate SD card.
That's enough for a warrant.
Yep, I'll call Barba.
Okay, now put your head down, and your eyes look right into the lens, right into the lens.
Oh, that's sexy.
Is that art or p0rn?
Depends on how much you pay for it.
We're in a session.
That's good. That means Alvin is here.
Wait, you can't just come in here.
We can get a little more detail on the dress, Alvin.
Sir.
Excuse me. We're working here.
SVU.
We're executing a search warrant for the Alvin Gilbert studio.
My name is Benno Gilbert. I'm his brother.
What the hell's going on?
All right, SD cards, computers, external drives.
Why don't we take five, folks?
What's this about?
A young model claims that Alvin raped her.
Sally? That little bitch.
She's lying.
Alvin...
Officers, this has to wait.
We're prepping our show.
We have an IPO looming. These are our investors.
Ma'am, that's none of our concern.
Claire, please.
Look, we agree to cooperate fully if you just let us finish our work.
She tried to shake down my assistant.
Okay, is that the camera that you used to shoot Sally?
Yeah, it's on the list.
Get your hands off my camera.
Do not touch my camera!
Hey!
Do not touch...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on.
Hey, hey, hey, Benno! He's breaking my arm.
He's an artist. Let him go.
He's resisting arrest.
That's not what I'm doing.
All right, let him go. You're hurting him.
Hey, you need to stop talking now, or you're gonna be under arrest as well, understood?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Benno.
Alvin Gilbert lawyered up en route.
It's not his first time at the rodeo.
Nope, there's stories about him all over town.
The guy preys on young models, and his brother, Benno's the fixer.
His assistant Nora facilitated.
She took photos.
TARU's going through his camera and SD cards.
Uhhuh, I'm surprised it's gotten this far.
The House of Gilbert, they're masters at image control.
[scoffs]
Sally, you know, sweet kid, but her manager pimp, well, he controls her, slaps her around.
Yeah, we've met him.
She's his meal ticket.
He brings her to New York.
He feels her slipping away.
You mean Alvin had s*x with her?
Photographers and girls, you know, it happens.
And if the mook boyfriend finds out...
Girl cries rape?
That's your take?
[chuckles]
My brother dates supermodels.
He doesn't need to rape a go-see.
Photography is seduction of the viewer's eye, of the camera, and even of me.
She is legal. We have her license on file.
She signed a release.
My assistant was there the whole time.
You... you think I'd rape someone in front of her?
I do.
You know what, Sunil?
I don't need this.
No, you don't.
Gentlemen... Sit down!
You're in our custody.
For resisting arrest?
Detective, that is a lawsuit waiting to happen.
Carisi, hold on.
Let the man tell his side of the story.
Okay.
Her manager accosted me at a bar, showed me her photos, brought her over to me.
She showed up at my studio without him.
She knew my work, and she came ready to play.
"She showed up alone. She came to play."
They've got their defense.
Where are those photos?
I will ask again.
Alvin and the girl just clicked.
Okay, that's not how Sally's describing it.
Now, because she wants something from this family.
Alvin was just responding to what she was putting out, what she wanted from him.
Sally didn't want what he did to her.
Not what I saw.
I saw a girl who knew what she was doing.
Well, I think you knew what you were doing.
Getting an underage girl drunk.
Really?
Do you know what these girls put in their systems?
This woman sets up models to be raped.
What, does she get off on watching?
Pictures are in.
Finally.
♪ ♪
Ugh.
She looks terrified.
Or they'll say that's the campaign.
"When fear becomes obsession." Seriously?
I have to tell you about rape culture?
That's not an ad campaign; that's a girl being assaulted.
Look, Barba's right.
They're just gonna claim that this was staged.
[sighing]
Is this enough to arrest?
I'd like more, but if we don't indict, he hops on a jet to France, doesn't come back till Sally gets paid off.
Right.
[tapping]
How about we book Nora too?
Nora Wattan, stand up.
You're under arrest.
Me?
Because I gave a girl a drink?
For starters. Turn around.
And you facilitated her assault.
In New York, that's rape in the first.
[gasps]
Alvin Gilbert, one count of first-degree...
That's "Jill-bare," Your Honor.
Either way.
One count of first-degree rape, how do you plead?
Not guilty, Your Honor.
People on bail?
Remand. Mr. Gilbert has a family jet and, uh, residences in five countries.
My client has no record and is the editorial director of a fashion empire.
His family's business would be seriously jeopardized if he had to cancel any bookings, Your Honor.
I'm sure they have the means to get by.
Given his resources, the defendant will surrender his passport.
Bail is set at $500,000.
[gavel bangs]
500 grand.
That's good.
Really?
Yeah.
Next case, "People versus Nora Wattan."
Are you representing her as well, Mr. Varma?
For the moment, Your Honor.
We are arranging for separate counsel for Miss Wattan.
A wise decision, and hopefully, the appropriate person will be retained...
[speaking indistinctly]
I'd like to move along.
This is a complicated case, Your Honor.
They've got 120 hours to indict.
Get me more for the grand jury.
Fin's trying to track down the model that accused Alvin 12 years ago.
Tell Fin to hurry it up.
How about we go back to Nora?
I mean, the Gilberts aren't even pretending to be worried about her.
Yeah.
Counselor, have you found separate counsel yet for Miss Wattan?
I have my hands full.
Uhhuh, empty them.
I need a word with her.
Sorry we're late.
And you are?
Jason Gruber.
And you've passed the bar exam?
Mr. Varma and I have worked closely on several cases, and he led me to believe you wanted to discuss a deal?
We do.
Good, because clearly, the charges against my client are an overreach.
Okay, if Miss Wattan will testify about Alvin's assault, we can talk about withdrawing her rape charge.
That was not an assault.
That was a creative collaboration... fear, lust, release, capturing primal emotions.
Okay, I get it.
You've been Alvin's muse.
She's his associate.
But you're not seeing him for who he is.
Don't patronize me.
Alvin is a genius.
I would never betray him, and neither will any model in this city.
Well, I hope you're right, 'cause we're gonna be talking to all of them.
The first time with Alvin?
Paris.
He propositioned you?
Alvin doesn't ask.
He takes.
Did you want to have s*x with him?
No, but Alvin did.
Did you say no?
[scoffs]
Nobody says no to Alvin Gilbert.
I mean, he didn't hold a gun on me.
Actually, he did.
He held a gun on you?
I don't think it was loaded.
Would you be willing to testify?
Against Alvin?
No. I would never work again.
Wait, he told you that?
[scoffs] He doesn't have to.
I'm sorry.
That was fast.
At least she came in. These others...
Munch came through.
He found Alvin's Vic from 12 years ago.
She changed her name and owns a modeling agency.
She sends girls to Alvin.
You two, huh?
Why bring up something that happened 12 years ago?
Because it happened again, three days ago.
[sighs]
And you're the ones going after Alvin?
That girl, she's not so innocent, and she was not one of mine.
But you've sent him other girls.
This is a business.
Alvin's the best. He's a career maker.
A girl becomes Alvin's muse, every door is open.
Muse?
You tried to kill yourself.
Oh, yeah, poor me.
I was a gamine, so young, so naive, 18, posing half naked for a man twice my age.
I knew I was turning him on.
When he started to touch me I could've walked away, but I didn't.
What did I think was gonna happen?
Three days, two dozen interviews.
At least half of these models admit to being pressured into s*x.
None of them will testify.
But what about the Vic from 12 years ago?
That story has a happy ending.
She's pimping for him now.
No one wants to bite the hand that made them.
The clock is running out.
Grand jury's tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.
Take another run at Nora?
Not a chance.
She thinks she's part of the family.
Okay, so all we have is Sally.
Prep her.
Make sure she's good to go.
So you just tell the grand jurors the details of what Alvin did to you.
There's no cross-examination.
Is Mr. Barba gonna show everyone the photos that Nora took?
I'm sorry...
[door rattles open]
What the hell are you doing here?
Take it easy, man.
We're here on police business.
We're prepping Sally for her testimony.
Oh, okay.
I didn't see you.
Sally, you didn't tell me.
Well, you were gone for three hours.
I was at the gym.
I told you that.
[sighs]
Well... [grunts] I'm here now.
Tell me what she's gonna have to do.
She's late. Was she okay when you left her?
Uh, yeah, I mean, Matt the manager was draped all over her, but she was steady on her story.
There she is. Sally.
Hey.
Grand jury's waiting. Shall we?
Great, Matt, you can wait here; let's go.
Actually, I'm not going to testify.
I'm sorry?
After you left, I-I kept thinking about those photos, total strangers seeing them and people back home too.
Alvin is famous.
You don't understand.
Once it's all over the Internet...
No one will see them.
These proceedings are secret, and you're a minor.
Yeah, right, those photos will get out.
It's like what happened with Erin Andrews.
Matt, wouldn't you be pissed if Alvin got away with this?
If it was up to me, I'd put a slug in the guy.
Be that as it may, this is what Sally wants.
Right, babe?
Sally, please don't do this.
We're screwed. No continuance.
If the grand jury doesn't indict by 5:00 tomorrow, Alvin's bail automatically reduces to $1.
He won't stick around.
Passport or not, he'll find a way out.
Does anyone actually believe Sally is the one making this decision?
Matt's obviously pulling her strings.
Sally is his meal ticket.
The Gilberts must've made Sally an offer that Matt couldn't refuse.
Witness tampering? That's tough to prove.
Well, unless you have a better idea, that's all I got.
Sorry, detectives.
Witness tampering?
I've had zero contact with Sally Landry.
Sonya!
That hem is pulling out.
What about her manager, Matt?
Uh, he did come to see me yesterday.
He didn't tell you?
Maybe that's because he pulled a gun on me and Alvin.
What'd he want?
$50,000.
In exchange for Sally not testifying?
Benno!
The beer is warm out here...
Go start without me.
You guys come here to apologize?
Why, because Benno paid off Sally's manager?
There was no quid pro quo.
All right, he pitched a couple of lame-ass editorial ideas.
I pretended to like them, and I gave him some seed money.
He pulls a gun.
You write a check, and you didn't call the police?
Look, I'm a businessman, all right?
We're about to go public.
My brother is 100% innocent.
How about 1,000%?
So if I can make this go away...
All right, I'm not lawyer, but it sounds like you're admitting to paying off a witness.
I did this to help Sally.
I thought that if this cheap suit Svengali got a taste, maybe he'd leave the poor girl alone.
You saw her bruises.
This boyfriend, he's the one who rapes her.
When I simulated violence, she got off on it.
Oh, Alvin.
Benno...
Please.
Benno, stop worrying.
Lighten up, okay?
Did I come with a gun?
Did I come with a gun? Did I come with a gun?
Is that what they told you?
Matt, they have witnesses.
The gun was part of my pitch.
Okay, so just calm down.
What... what pitch?
Okay?
Alvin likes guns.
You seen the series with the girls sucking on gun barrels?
They hired me to consult editorially.
For 50 grand?
And you're telling me that had nothing to do with Sally dropping the charges?
Nothing?
Tell them. Tell them.
Tell them how I'm protecting your career.
He is.
I testify, and I'm back at the creamery making Fudge-Anas.
And that's not gonna happen to my baby.
[phone ringing]
Yeah?
She'll be there.
And you put me on the list, right?
Guess who's closing the Gilbert runway show tomorrow.
Oh, my gosh!
Aw.
Really?
Wait, will Alvin be there?
Don't worry, baby.
I won't let you out of my sight.
Can I ask who just called to make that booking?
Was it Nora?
Nora? No, Nora's gone.
Claire, Benno's wife, she's running the show now.
If you'll excuse us, my baby needs her beauty rest.
Mm?
 booking Alvin's models. It's just temporary.
So you're not involved in tomorrow's fashion show?
All on the advice of counsel.
Alvin's or yours, Nora?
Oh, right, yours is paid for by his family.
When there's no case, there's no case.
Well, actually...
Nora has admitted to serving Sally, a minor, drinks.
Oh, please.
And what should be more troubling to her legal team, Nora has admitted to taking photos of Sally having s*x with Alvin.
Consensual s*x.
She's 17, and while New York may not be able to press charges, according to the Feds, that constitutes child pornography.
Is that true?
He knows it is.
Punishable by five years for each image.
It's just a tactic, Nora.
A tactic?
Nora, the Gilberts gave Matt $50,000 to "consult."
Sally is in the runway show. What have they done for you?
Nora, when is the last time you spoke with Alvin?
He is taking your calls, isn't he?
There's been no contact on advice of counsel.
Oh, come on.
Since when does Alvin listen to anybody?
You think he'll visit you in prison?
Or maybe do a spread, Models Behind Bars?
That's it. We're done. Nora, let's go.
You know Alvin better than anybody, right?
He's always on to the next, on to the next look, on to the next model.
You may feel different, but you know he'll find a new muse.
You don't understand what we have.
I think that I do.
He's gonna tell you that he's sorry and that he feels bad and that he loves you but he had no choice.
You've heard that before, right?
Alvin, this is the first time he's been arrested.
The Gilberts protect their own.
You're not his wife.
You're not his family.
You're the hired help.

So not a robbery.
He was shot once in the chest, once in the groin?
Well, the M.E. thought that the shot in the groin was first.
Of course it was.
Somebody wanted Alvin to have a couple seconds to think about who shot him and what his life would be like without his pecker.
[phone ringing]
Vonnegut?
"Slaughterhouse-Five."
Benson.
We found Matt's gun.
9-millimeter Beretta.
Yeah, I don't even think this has been fired, no.
This isn't even operable.
Have you ever seen him with a different gun?
No, just that one.
He sleeps with it under his pillow.
Does that mean he didn't do it?
Look, please, please do not let him know I led you to him.
No GSR on Matt's hand.
Wrong gun. So we just let him go?
No, not until I talk to Sally.
Maybe get an OOP for her.
You're worried about what he might do?
Oh, I know what he'll do.
Then I'll hold him on the gun charge, make sure he does time on that.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I got security footage from the courtyard.
Shooter knew where the camera was, so he stays out of view.
Back up.
Pause it.
Right there when Alvin turns around, the look on his face when he sees the shooter.
He knows him.
[cell phone chimes]
He's not afraid of him.
Uni found a gun on the roof, a .357 Magnum.
.357? That's old-school.
Yeah, it is, just like Alvin's.
What? Alvin was shot with his own gun?
Maybe.
By someone he knew.
By someone he was happy to see.
We got this all wrong.
It's not the guy who was shaking Alvin down.
It's the guy who's been cleaning up his messes.
Thank you so much for coming in.
Right this way.
Yeah, let's hope, uh... we heard you arrested Matt.
We did, and, um, we just wanted to go over the timeline with you.
Anything we can do.
So we got this from a model backstage.
This is Alvin halfway through the show.
Yeah, I saw him there.
Yeah, uh, same spot five minutes later, Claire is there.
Alvin's gone.
Alvin always went out for a smoke halfway through.
And where were you at this point, Benno?
I am everywhere, um, checking on the hair and the clothes and the makeup.
I mean, I'm just making sure everything's going right.
Sounds like a lot of pressure.
He's the best in the world at it.
And on top of that, you have to worry about your little brother getting arrested for multiple counts of rape.
Alvin was not a rapist.
You mean he was never convicted because every time he was accused, you just made it go away.
Alvin's dead. Matt killed him.
Why are we talking about any of this?
Because Matt wasn't the shooter.
It wasn't his gun.
Alvin was shot with his own gun.
So Matt stole it from the studio.
No.
He would've had gunshot residue on his hands.
We picked him up right afterwards, and there's... there was no residue, no GSR.
I mean, you fire a gun like that, and it gets all over everything, you know, everything you touch.
So, if, say, you shot your brother and then five minutes later you hugged Sally, we would find gunshot residue on that dress.
So CSU's going to pick up that dress right now from your atelier.
You can't think my husband did this.
Yeah, I can.
You see, I have a younger brother.
He's been in and out of rehab so many times, I've lost count.
And every time that he gets in trouble, he tells the cops, "Call my brother. He's on the job. He'll take care of it."
And then when I go pick him up, he says, "Promise me you won't tell Dad."
[chuckles]
He's my brother, and I love him.
But I can't tell you how much easier my life would be without him.
Alvin getting arrested, Alvin going to trial right when your company was about to go public...
We would've lost everything.
Stop, Benno.
You are going to find gunshot residue on the dress from my hands.
No, Claire, no!
I shot him, Benno.
I couldn't let him take you... us down.
No, stop it. Shut up. Stop it right now.
Shut up. She's lying.
I shot him.
No, you didn't. I did.
And we're not gonna say another word about it until our lawyer comes.
Their lawyers say they were never Mirandized.
Were they in custody?
Nope, they came in voluntarily.
Okay, that goes away.
Bigger problem: they both confessed.
Which means each one has created reasonable doubt for the other.
Onion Field meets Fashion Avenue.
The question is, who's lying?
She is. He did it.
That look on Alvin's face right before he got shot...
I know that look.
So that story you told Benno about your brother...
It wasn't a story.
[door clicks and rattles]
Hey, Noah.
Hey, sweet boy, Mommy's home.
Thanks, John.
You finally got Benno to take a plea.
Worth the wait. Brother killing brother, I didn't see that coming.
Well, Dodds did.
Dodds, the new, new guy?
Yeah.
Fin told me you got a good squad working for you.
[sighs] Fin said what?
I was worried when I left that I'd fall apart without the job or the place would fall apart without me.
Well, I was too.
Oh, yeah, but it's been good.
Turns out there's more to life than SVU.
Hmm, ain't that the truth?
Well, I'm glad we both found that out.
Had a great time with him today.
Taught him a major life lesson.
Always question authority.
Ah, what a surprise.
How was that?
Noah, show Mommy.
Say, "Why?"
Why?
Ah!
[both laughing]
You can thank me when he's a fully functioning, anti-dogmatic atheist.
[laughing] I'll do that.
I should get going.
Okay.
Bye, little man.
[exhales]
Take care of each other.
[whispering] We will. You too.
Say, "Bye, Munch."
[whispers] Bye, Munch.
Hmm. Yeah.
Bye.
