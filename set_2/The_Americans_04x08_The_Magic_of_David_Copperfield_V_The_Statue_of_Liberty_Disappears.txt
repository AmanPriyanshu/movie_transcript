I-I mean, it is weird talking in front of strangers, but...
But they don't let you just stand there and say anything you want.
You know, they question it.
Make you question it.
Yeah. Right. They keep you honest.
It helps. I can... I can see that.
But?
They just try so hard to get you to sign up for more.
You know, spend more money and bring in your friends and...
That's not the point.
Well, I think that is the point.
They manipulate you to get at your wallet.

It happens, Philip. We lose agents.

At least she's alive.
You didn't have to send her out onto the street to get mowed down.

Why?
I just...
Henry is getting some extra help on his Spanish.
He won't be back until 6:00, so...
[Sighs]
I'm just...
I went last week and the week before.
You have to go every week, Paige, if you're going to stay close to Pastor Tim.
Mom, it's fine if I skip a week.
I can see why it might look that way to you, but you need to maintain a consistent presence in his life.
When you go to Bible study, you have to talk and be into it, so if I'm not in the mood, it's gonna be obvious.
Well, then you get yourself in the mood.
[Sighs]
[Sternly] Get back in here right now.
We've been trying, Paige... trying to be nice to you, trying to forgive you for what you did.
But if you think for a minute you can be precious about your moods when it comes to Pastor Tim and his wife...
I can't control how I feel!
You can control what you do.
And from now on, you are going to.
And let me be clear about what you are going to do.
You are going to go to Bible study every week.
You are going to go to Sunday services every week.
You are going to find some other sh1t to volunteer for at that Goddamn church so that not a day goes by without you seeing Pastor Tim and his wife.
And then you are going to come home every night, and you're gonna tell me and your father everything that happened... what was said, their moods, their attitudes, their feelings... because that is what is important right now.
Because, thanks to what you did, that is all that stands between us and this family being destroyed.

Well, that could be anything.
I'm pretty sure they're not calling me up for a commendation, Stan.

He was sure that was the end.
Gets up there, waits two hours, turns out the Director had some visiting dignitary who's a stamp collector.

I had a friend... Gakov, a decorated officer.
We were close since school.
Then he became an "enemy of the people."
I had to go to his house and pull him out in front of his wife, his son, and his two daughters.
The wife was screaming.
The children were screaming.
"Not you, comrade," he said.
They pushed him into a car.
We did what we had to do.
That's the way it was.
Or we got killed ourselves.
They think this is so bad, what they're going through?
They have no idea.
You're angry. You...
Yes, I'm angry, and I'm frustrated.
I'm losing my influence with them.
They're not listening to me.
Oh, your officers aren't listening to you.
Boohoo.
It's never been this bad.
It's worse every day.
Things have gone to sh1t, and you think, "Well, it's not their fault," so it has to be yours.
Well, whose fault is it?
It's the world.
