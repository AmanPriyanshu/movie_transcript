[chords play]
All right, everybody.
Before we get to today's interview, I think it's time to address the pink elephant in the room.
Many of you have read or seen stuff about me on the Internet, on Reddit, on Twitter, or, you know, in the blogosphere.
It's time to set the record straight.
Several months ago, I... I experienced an injury, and I started using prescription pain medication, and as some of you know, if you're a recovering addict, pharmaceuticals can be a slippery slope, and I slipped.
All right, 16 years of sobriety down the drain.
I will say this... I nipped it in the bud.
It's water under the bridge, no harm, no foul.
And if you want to Tweet me some other clichés, feel free, but I think I covered them all.
Okay?
But... but, you know, Marc Maron is doing just fine.

Hey, yeah, listen, I think I've been pretty cool about your situation here, and, personally, I don't mind that you're living here.
I get it. I was in a band.
My boss is asking questions.
Two months, you don't pay, you know, he says, "Get him the hell out."
All right, all right.
Okay. I-I-I hear that.
Yeah.
But I'm getting a check this week, man!
Yeah, good.
Yeah, I'm gonna give you the money.
Yeah, we've been talking about that check for four weeks now.
All right.
I appreciate that, but hear me out.
I'm really close to turning everything around, man.
I mean, I'm gonna start podcasting again.
Good for you.
I got some other irons in the fire.
I'm going to meet my manager today.

Don't I seem better?
Unh-unh.
Okay, I-I-I...
I'm not gonna be picky anymore.
Really?
I'll take anything.
Yeah, get me on one of those dumb shows where I talk about other dumb shows.
Or maybe, you know, get me on one of those ones where I just say snarky bullshit about...

We're not gonna do it again. Okay?

This thing that you do every few weeks when you come in here... Stacy!... and your eyes are glassy and...
My eyes aren't glassy.
I don't represent you anymore.
I fired you.
You can't fire me. I'm the client.
I fire you. You don't fire me.
Well...
You can drop me, but you can't fire me.
I just... I just...
Okay. Then I dropped you. We'll say that.
sh1t.
Remember why I dropped you? For that...
You picked up a chair, threw it through the window.
I'm... I remember you telling me about something like that.
I can't have anything to do with you, not until you get some real help.
I don't need real help. I need...
I don't know what has to happen to you before you hit your rock bottom.
You blew the pilot.
The podcast that you built from nothing, that saved your life, you pissed that away.
Well, I-I'm... I'm actually doing the podcast again.
Honest to God! No, you're not.
It's been a year.
That's not doing it.
The bank took your home away. You are home-less.
No. No, I'm not homeless.
Mm.
I'm... no.
I'm in a... a studio-apartment situation.
Totally different.
Look. L-Listen.
Listen, I... I went through some sh1t, okay?
Had nothing to do with drugs. All right?
It was just some existential, midlife-crisis stuff.
You know what I mean? I just...
You know, I just... I got... I got tired... of... life.
But I'm working through it, [raising voice] and I need to make some money.
So get me on a stupid game show where one idiot tells another idiot to turn some letters around, Emily!
Just get me one of those!
Just the highest-paid gig on TV.
I love you, Marc, but you... you have a problem.
Well, I disagree!

Can you just...?
Come on, man. It's for my career.
Yeah, I... I... I don't know.
I'd have to check with him first.

Dave's gonna pick you up.
I'm just in town for a couple of days, so bring the mikes.
You've still got the mikes, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Don't worry about it.

No, he's there now.

Ha.
Yeah!
Dave!
Over here, buddy.
Artist colony, huh?
Yeah. Whatever you got to tell yourself.
So, uh, I guess Louis wasn't "too busy" for me, after all, huh?
Wow. You know, I have some, uh, wet naps in the car if you need to... bathe.
Okay. That's funny.
But do you?
No.
So, uh... you gonna invite me in?
I mean, do you invite someone into a storage locker or do you lure them in?
All right. Come on in.
Do I take off my shoes?
Yes, please.
Oh, wow. This...
Hey, look, stop being so judgmental, will you?
Your house isn't that much nicer than this.
No, it is.
So, okay.
So, Louis, did he sound, uh... did he sound into it?
Oh, yeah.
It's just the career boost he's looking for.
Oh, and this is what I was looking for... a sh1t bucket with a toilet seat.
All right, you're an asshole.
And an Instagrammer.
You know who's gonna favorite this?
Everybody.
Okay, enough fun.
Uh, I don't... I don't really know where my mikes are.
You don't think Louis' gonna care if I use my phone to record, do you?
You sold your mikes.
No. M-Maybe.
I don't know. I don't know.
Yeah, well, when you live in a high-end neighborhood, you really got to make some sacrifices.
It's all turning around, buddy. Louis' throwing me a bone.
Yeah. You mind if I park my lawn mower in your living room?

Oh, hell yes, man.
Louis came through, buddy. Louis came through.
You know, Louis's not really the answer to your problems.

I mean, you're a talented guy, and you have a history of overcoming a lot of sh1t.

And this is Trey's third rehab.
He's gotten every chance in life. He's screwed them all up.
Well, it's good that you respect his confidentiality.
Right.
So he's just some annoying poseur?
He appreciates street culture.
He put out six rap albums.
The last one was called "I Even Kill Ghosts."
Move me. I don't want to room with that.
Marc, I can't do that.
Part of getting sober is learning how to be able to get along with people you don't like.
Isn't that what you're for?
Okay.
Look, the kid's not gonna make it through rehab.
He's a relapse machine.
You may be surprised.
The only person that Trey is destined to become is the person he decides to be.
So... what do you think your destiny is?
What i... What is that?
What the hell are you doing?
I told you I want to do a sobriety podcast.
You can't just record people without asking them.
It... It's... It's illegal.
I didn't know that.
Yeah, they have to sign a release.
Well, if I made one up, would you sign it?
No!
Will you help me write one at least?
No!
What's the matter with you?!
I want to... I want to help people.
I want to be a podcaster and help people.
You want to help people? Move me!
I can't do that.
But maybe if you signed the release...
What?! What are... What are you doing now?
You're blackmailing me?
That's what you're doing, you morally bankrupt... monster?
[sighs]
[rock music plays]
[sighs]
Really? Really?
sh1t!
[sighs]
You... You cool, man?
Yeah. Fine. Why?
Y-You just screamed, "sh1t!" L-Loud.
C-Crazy-loud.
Wow.
I didn't realize it. I-I'm sorry.
I-I'm just having some... some issues.
Just small stuff. I-I-It's no big deal.
Clearly not a big deal.
You're just screaming, "sh1t!" and not remembering it.
You... Y-You want to t-talk about it?
I'm... I'm... I'm Adam, and this... this... this is Carla.
Hi. We sort of met in the hallway when you made a run for it.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm Marc.
Yeah, I don't like my roommate, and... and... and, you know, Chris won't move me.
And...
I-I think he's, uh...
He's... He's recording us all secretly for a podcast or something.
It's... It's... It's actually going to be pr... pretty great.
V-Very raw.
I-I-I f-figured you... you'd like that.
What does that mean?
S-Sorry. B-Busted.
I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm a fan. I-I-I have all your albums.
I've seen you at the Comedy Store a b-b-bunch.
[sighs] God, these people.
You're a comedian.
[sighs]
I have no idea who you are, if that helps.
[chuckles] I like Jeff Dunham.
Really?
I guess we know why you drink now.
No.
Adderall. Adderall.
I di... Adderall. I did a lot of Adderall.
[chuckles]
But, uh... And I don't like-him like him.
I'm just into ventriloquism. [chuckles]
I just don't get how they do that, you know?
I-I would do it differently.
I want to be the anti-Jeff Dunham.
I'd like to have a trans dummy.
Reinvent it a little bit.
Right. Okay.
High time we start exploring the gender politics of, you know, puppets, I think.
Who are you rooming with?
Trey.
Oh. Yeah. Trey.
He's a problem.
But I think he's just acting out.
It's... It's... It's so true.
I mea... I mean, you've... you've... you've talked about that on... on... on your podcast with Fred Arm... Armisen, remember?
When you... you... you were talking about s*x and... and... and I'm not... I'm not helping.
Last thing you want to do is make someone feel like they're so bad you can't room with him.
You know, it wouldn't be very good for his sobriety.
No, yeah. I wouldn't want to do that.
What's up, snitch?!
What's that?
Heard you don't want to shack with me and called me an annoying poseur who'd be bad for your sobriety, said, "There's no way Trey makes it. He's a relapse machine."
Never happened, man. I wouldn't do that, all right?
He's making stuff up.
Oh, really, yo? Really?
'Cause Chris recorded it.
Did... Did you really do that?
Yeah, I said it. All right?
I was pissed off, all right? And I... And I blew up.
Oh, oh, so if you blew up, then it's fine.
You tried to steal my watch. What do you want from me, man?
How about the watch?
Look.
I'm not giving you my watch.
Give me the watch, snitch bitch!
Yeah, okay, uh...
Run it. Run it.
All right, all right, Jesus Christ. I don't even know what that means.
It's just, uh...
I don't care about the watch.
[chuckles]
What is this, rehab or high school?
I don't know, man. Why don't you go ask Principal Chris?
What?!
Uh, uh, no... no... nothing, nothing.
I-I-I-I like you.
Yeah, that's right.
As y'all bitches were.
Wow.
What a disappointing display of masculinity all around.
Wait, m-me?
Arguably the worst.
♪♪
Hey.
What the hell are you?
Excuse me a moment.
I am a sobriety counselor, Marc.
Oh, really? 'Cause it seems like you're more like a middle school gossip queen.
I can't remember meeting someone who got so up in my sh1t in such a short amount of time.
It's astounding.
You're an astounding human being.
Hey, don't tell this guy sh1t.
Your worth should never depend on another person's opinion.
What? That... That A.A. slogan doesn't even apply here.
You are the most full-of-shit person in this entire rehab center, and you're the counselor.
You're just a wannabe podcaster, gossip queen, sh1t starter.
Are you done?
No!
People like you are why people drink, not get sober.
"Anger" is one letter away from "danger."
Oh, my God!
Do you have any thoughts that aren't from an A.A. pamphlet?
Are you even a person?
Yes, I am a sober person, and I'm a person with a lot of experience.
And you need to understand that you are exactly where God wants you to be.
Oh, I guess God wants me to be talking to a douchebag.
What... What are you... What are you doing?
Are you trying to think of an A.A. slogan with the word "douchebag" in it?
I think you should go to your room.
Oh, yeah, about that.
I'm switching rooms. I'm just gonna pick one.
I don't care what you think.
That's not how it works.
It is now.
♪♪
Yeah.
That's right.
That's Marc Maron.
He used to live in a storage locker.
Hey, man, I-I just think it'll be better off if we get, you know, a fresh start.
You and I didn't really get along from the get-go, so, look.
Like, I-I just think it would be better off for both of us if we...
[sniffs]
What is that?
[chuckles lightly]
Did you sh1t on my bed?
[chuckles]
You sh1t on my bed?!
You got up there and squatted like a dumb monkey?!
And that's your watch on top.
[chuckles]
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Just keeping it real, man.
You have no idea what that means!
Jesus Christ!
You don't think I know what you are?
Oh, here we go. Old man lecture time.
All right. All right.
You want to know why you sh1t on my bed?
Um, convenience?
No! No, smart-ass!
Because I'm the closest guy to your dad's age in here!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, and let me guess.
He didn't give you nothing when you were growing up, right?
You don't even know if he loves you.
Am I hitting it? Huh?
Okay, maybe he gave you stuff. Maybe he gave you cars.
Maybe he gave you clothes, material stuff, right, you spoiled puss?
No.
But you wanted your daddy, right, but he couldn't do it 'cause he was too narcissistic.
He's too self-centered.
So you ruined everything and every chance he gave you.
And then you ruined yourself on drugs.
And now you're such a piece of garbage that you sh1t on someone else's bed?!
Damn!
It's kind of poetic, though, isn't it?
'Cause that's how you feel about yourself.
Am... Am I close, Trey?
[sobbing]
[sighs]
He didn't even come to my high-school graduation, man.
[sobbing continues]
Yeah, I get it. I ge... I get it, man.
All right, look, If I had a normal dad, I wouldn't be in here, either. You know what I mean?
It screws us up, man.
[sighs] I hate myself.
It's... Yeah, it's... [scoffs]
All right, all right, all right.
Come on, y-you're... you're... you're...
You know, you're a good kid.
You're letting it out. Let it out.
It's good, man. It's good.
[sobbing loudly]
I was exactly where you are when I was your age.
Seriously.
I was doing a lot of blow, all right?
And... And I got through it, though.
All right? I got through it.
I sobered up, and I got my sh1t together.
Then why are you back here?
Well, they... they didn't have Oxy back then, and, you know, that sh1t's good.
Like, I had... I had back pain, [chuckling] but, whoa, right?
[chuckles] Yeah.
W-Wait, that's not what this is about, all right?
Listen, I-I-I'm... I'm here to tell you that you'll be fine, okay? You're gonna be fine.
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, uh... you moving out?
Hey, I got to be honest. You know?
sh1tting on your roommate's bed's not the greatest foundation for a friendship.
I get it. I get it.
[sighs]
[sniffs, scoffs]
All right, all... I'll stay, all right, on one condition.
We switch beds.
[scoffs] Hey, that's fair.
That's fair, man.
Look... [claps hands] I'm sorry I sh1t on your bed, man.
[chuckles] I'm an animal.
Yeah, but e-even my cats use a litter box.
[chuckles]
I'm gonna go get something to clean this up.
All right, wait, look, here.
Use this, and... you can keep the watch.
[laughs] All right.
I'm getting out, dude. This stinks.
It's bad.
All right.
You're bad.
Hey, some people enjoy the smell of their own brand.
I'm just saying.
[bird squawks]
You good, dawg?
I am good, man.
[chuckles] Later.
Don't quit before the miracle.
Shut up.
Heard it worked out with you and Trey.
Yeah, yeah, we talked it out.
So maybe you don't always have the right impulses or instincts about other people.
[clicks tongue] Uh, no, Chris. Usually, I do.
It just takes me a while to get to them.
Like... Like, for instance, you.
I know you're not some sort of sobriety wizard.
I also know that you're bordering on inappropriate, perhaps even illegal behavior.
Okay, I think I have an amends to make.
I didn't act appropriately.
I did record you and maybe some others.
I think I may have crossed a line.
People's privacy is important.
Yeah, yeah. It was messed up what you did, man.
I'm sorry.
Okay, all right. I appreciate that.
So, uh, the wording on this release form...
If you could take a quick look at it...
No, no, I won't.
I... Did... Did you record this, too?
I... did.
[blues music plays]
[sighs] It's so screwed up, man.
Seriously, what's wrong with you?
You've got a problem.
