Previously on Empire...
Will you marry me?
Yes.
(CROWD CHEERS)
If only Cookie knew what you did while she was away in prison.
Wouldn't be such a Sister Sledge reunion now, would it?
The Lyon family will be performing at this year's ASA awards.
Me and my son are not the only people up for this award. I'm just saying, I'm ready to play. You ready to play?
I was born to play.
The board would like you to come on as co-CEOs.
I think it's a fantastic idea.
I got your back.
Hi, Grandma, it's Andre.
I wish I could have met you.
That woman's name is Leah Walker.
I believe she's your grandmother.
N-43.
It's right there.
She has a system... and the system's called cheating.
Well, I haven't noticed her cheating, so... it's okay.
I-27.
They treat you okay here?
Not Mondays.
I hate meat loaf.
She means Meatloaf Mondays, which are delicious.
Thank you.
I-29.
So, how about your family?
Does your family come visit you?
B-7.
: Oh!
Oh... bingo!
(GRUNTS)
That round was for the watercolor set.
Check his card!
The boy's famous now.
The boy.
Is the boy your son?
I had the voice, but they never gave me a chance.
They didn't want me to.
Your eyes.
Are you kin to me?

Becky, it was good?
Keem, I'm living for it.
It's a dope song, right?
It's dope!
Now, look, all I got to get is this song on the Ryan Coogler movie and it instantly gets me famous.
I can't believe that this came about from Ryan hearing your stripper joint.
Worked for Lil Jon, didn't it?
True.
(LAUGHS) That's exactly what he's looking for, too.
Although he is a little worried about who's gonna sing the girl part.
I was thinking Tiana.
: Tiana?
Yeah... Tiana could work 'cause she's real hot off of her tour, but...
But what?
You don't think Laura would have a problem with that?
Nah, you overthinking it. It's just business.
Laura totally gets it.
She gets it.
: So, we're gonna trace the Lyon family sound from Lucious in the early Philly days to Jamal's new album, but I need seven minutes of stage time, not four.
Seven minutes?
Yeah.
You pushing it, Cookie.
Oh, that's what I do.
: No.
(LAUGHS)
Mr. D-Major.
Oh, the god of the ASAs, himself.
Oh, what's good, B?
I'm so proud of you.
I knew you had it.
I got something.
You talking about Lucious Lyon, classic monster?
This is what we're gonna do for the ASAs.
Well, actually, I was thinking we base the Lyon Family Anthem off of one of Jamal's.
He is Empire's most nominated artist.
: And that is a dope idea, because I can produce a remix to the song and I can add a verse for you, and then one for Hakeem...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're gonna have to slow your flaps on that.
Look, I run the music on this thing.
Hey!
We gonna...
Hi, hi, you forgot, I'm co-CEO.
"Co" as in co-pilot, and I will call you if I need a bathroom break.
Oh, what's wrong, Pufnstuf?
Look, I...
You mad 'cause you been on that cleanse for a week and you ain't lost no weight, fat-ass?
Funny.

Oh, Jamal, come here, baby!
Hey, Ma.
You know D-Major, musical director for the ASAs.
Of course.
Congrats, man.
I'm super stoked that you're doing the ASAs.
Well, I'm stoked about the remix.
I wasn't a big fan of the single, but it's perfect for the Lyon Family Anthem.
Okay...
I'm not sure what we're talking about.
I'm doing one of my new songs.
Oh, no... your mama traded in your solo.
It's gonna be huge, Jamal.
The whole family on the stage...
Mama, no, I...
I-I can't trade in my solo.
Dude, this is the ASAs.
It's the biggest stage in the world.
Now, if you want to be on it, I wouldn't be throwing some hissy fit.
Porsha, hold up. Here.
You think I got time to read?
This is the Bible.
It's been handed down from assistant to assistant since the... will you take it?
God.
It tells you what to do, what not to do, who to call... Cookie got a promotion.
That means you got a promotion now, too, so... read it cover to cover.
Thank you.
No, don't-don't thank me.
You work for a CEO now, so it's time to step your game up.
: This is the stage layout right here.
(MOUTHS)
Check on those...
Hey, Hakeem. Hakeem!
(WHOOPS) Yeah.
Got a verse for me?
Mom, I'm not singing backup for Lucious at the ASAs.
I got my own thing I'm working on.
Boy, it's not backup... and you can chew gum and walk at the same time, can't you?
Look... rehearsal at Laviticus, don't be late.
All right.
Yeah, all right.
: Nice place, Loretha.
What'd I tell you about calling me by my government name?
Look, whatever it is you came for, Candace, we ain't got time.
Hey, is something wrong with my kids?
Yes.
They're not with their mother, and it's time they should be.
Look, Candace, please don't start all of that.
You know she just got out of rehab.
She needs to focus.
Just because you weren't around to raise your kids doesn't mean we're gonna follow your example, Cookie.
When the winter break is over, the kids are coming here.
Hey, wait a minute.
You know I only have a two-bedroom apartment. then I suggest you invest in some bunk beds.
I'm serious, Carol.

Now!
Wink, shut the door.
Yeah, man.
Look, all I'm saying is that...
Yeah, man, I get it, you're a visionary artist, but I got a hundred artists that I have to juggle, plus produce the show, so if you're not happy, I suggest you go talk to your mother.

I can't see Ryan Coogler not putting this on the soundtrack.
Soundtrack?
I definitely want that on my next album.
It's 1:00?
I thought it was 10:00.
Laura gonna kill me.
Wow... the Hakeem I knew would want to go to the club right now... but I guess you can't, huh?
Since you got a wifey... and a baby mama.
What, you got jokes?
(LAUGHING): I'm just...
Look, I can go to the club if I want, but Cookie got me focusing on this ASA thing, so...
Well, we're definitely gonna miss you.
: Okay, I need you to put that on table 7, those go on table...
You know, according to the Empire HR bible, setting out tables and stuff is not the job of the CEO assistants.
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.
Would you like a demotion?
I can arrange that.
I'll do it today.
Yeah, I know you will.
Sure.
Rough night?
Yeah.
But I ain't complaining, fool.
(CHUCKLES)
Gots to love it.
I don't know who ordered all this stuff, but I want it all 86ed out of here.
Yo, what's that green mess, anyway?
Dad's on a fast for the ASAs, 'cause Mom let him know that TV puts ten pounds on you.
No, he's doing it for his health.
Um, so I got a rough script.
Andre's gonna start with some narration to set up the scene; he should be here in a minute.
(LUCIOUS PLAYING PIANO)
Dad, that's not it.
You don't think that sounds played out? It honestly sounds like you're trying to make my song sound like your old song.
Well, if it sounds played out, it means you wrote a played out song.
I wrote a played out song?
I'm trying to fix...
No, you don't want to change it and you sound...
Listen, I'm not down with all of this R & B back and forth.
Mom, where's my verse supposed to be?
Okay, pause.
I'm supposed to sing on the bridge?
Pause!
I'm running this.
I got this, and of course we're gonna find somewhere for your verse, Hakeem... and Lucious, your verse can be a flip on Jamal's, and Jamal, it's your song.
: Thank you, Mom, thank you.
See, it's my song.
You know what? This ain't working.
I want to go back to my original plan.
: What original plan, Dad? Where we do the song where you accuse us of biting the hand that never really fed us?
Oh, you didn't eat?
Nah, he talking about the song that he wrote back when - (COOKIE SIGHING) he thought Mom was snitch bitch.
(DISCORDANT PIANO NOTE)
Now, y'all sound like a rack of bitches, okay?
Lucious can sit up here and take y'all's jaw jacking, but I'm not 'cause I'm running this show.
Excuse me?
Yeah, excuse me.
I busted my ass to finally get here and I'll be damned if I let y'all mess it up.
So put your big girl drawers on, 'cause we gonna come together and do this as a family.
Does anybody here know what that means?
: That's an intriguing question... and I have someone here with me that might have a point of view.
It's okay, Grandma.
This is your family.
: Lucious...
: Whose grandmother?
What do you mean Grandma?
Who is this lady?
Lucious.
Dwight?
Andre, what's going on?
This is Leah Walker...
Lucious' mother.
Andre, our grandmother's dead.
(SIGHS)
: What, you got nothing to say?
You want to tell them about how you... sent her away to a home for 21 years, never looked back?
Or how about how you sent Vernon out there once a month to pay out hush money to anybody who knew who she really was... how about that one, huh?
Dad, what?
Yeah, that's not true. It's not.
No, Harper Scott gave me her files.
Can't lie your way out of this one, Pop.
(CRYING)
You have no... idea what you've done.
I can't believe that just happened.
Yeah, it's deeper than we think, too.
You see the look on his face?
: What's good, Lyon brothers?
(PHONE BEEPING)
Here to check out your rehearsal.
Hey, yo, Laura blowing me up.
Meet you up, bro.
All right.
Baby...
Yo.
Yo, you might not want to go back there; Lucious and Cookie are trying to figure some things out.
Yeah, well, maybe I can help.
No, no, it's family stuff.
Besides, you really expect me to believe that you only came for rehearsal?
Yeah, that's my job, but if I'm not needed, then I'm out.
: Lucious...
Yeah, baby?
Why did you lie?
I didn't lie about anything.
Then what was that video about?
(SIGHS)
The truth.
My mother did try and drown me.
She did put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger, and told an eight-year-old boy that it was his fault she was the way she is.
Just turns out there was no bullets in the gun.
Well, if she didn't die then...
No... my mother died the day that they locked her up.
And then remember how under Reagan...
...the government took all the mentally ill patients and dumped them out on the street?
Well, one day in front of 30th Street Station, I damn near tripped over her.
Now you and me, we were on welfare and had two and a half kids, we couldn't take care of her if we wanted to.
You just... you could have at least told me about her, Lucious.
(WHISPERING): I couldn't.
I needed her to stay dead.
That's why I took Andre to the grave.
He just wouldn't leave it alone, you know.
But he just doesn't understand.
I mean, none of y'all understand how... dangerous she really is.
Why didn't you tell me?
How did you even find out?
What, you were snooping through my computer?
It doesn't matter how I found out.
What matters is, Tiana's doing a duet with you on a song you yourself told me would go platinum.
The producers wanted her.
It was out of my control, babe.
You could have pushed for me.
I bet you never even brought me up.
Baby...
I love you.
Okay? You know that.
But you can't automatically think you're gonna be on all my duets.
Trust me, there'll be other opportunities.
I trust you.
I just don't trust Tiana.
She's still feeling you.
So what if she is?
I want you.
♪ ♪
: I don't trust him, okay?
I think she needs to stay with us until we find a permanent situation.
No, Andre, we're staying in a hotel.
We can get her an adjoining room, babe.
Oh...
I think we should at least talk to her caregivers.
I mean, do you even know who her doctors are?
Great.
(SIGHS)
: This will be fun.
Come on, Granny Groove.
: What the hell?
: Whoopsy daisy.
Hey!
Where the hell you think you're going, man?
: Hey, Andre.
No, where you going?
Andre!
Andre, fall back.
Fall back?!
What you talking...
I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of this, but that's not what you want right now.
You're the one who hid her from everybody, you did that.
I didn't hide her.
You think she's like you.
She's a completely different kind of person.
Andre... she needs to be back at the home, baby.
You don't know how miserable she was in that home, Ma.
: She needs to be with professionals.
You don't know, you don't know about it.
Grandma, listen...
I got your medicine and your suitcase with all your things, all right?
I got plenty of room for you.
: We're gonna go home, okay?
: Andre...
I want to go home...
Yeah, we're going home, we're going home.
...with my Dwight.
Dwight...
I want to go to bed now.
I'll have the nurse take you to your room.
Juanita.
Yes, sir.
I want you to make sure she takes each and every one of her pills.
Watch her put them in her mouth.
Check to make sure she swallowed them.
Remove the phone out of her room, and nobody comes to see her without my permission.
And no matter what, you don't take your eyes off of her, okay?
Yes, sir.

That is family.

So, do we get our primetime spot at the ASAs?
Fire, fire... and more fire.
You did it. Mama's a beast.
Yeah, bro.
: I'm a beast!
Proud of her, right?
Yes, I am.
♪ ♪
If it was me, I'd be jealous that my sister had everything and I had nothing... but I guess you ain't that petty.
Congratulations, y'all!
Thank you, baby.
Y'all did it!
: Derek, Derek.
Yo, I'll catch up with you.
Look, you-you want to come by tonight?
I thought you wasn't cool with my deal.
You know I don't want to make you do anything you don't feel comfortable with.
I can handle it, okay?
Okay.
Later.

Mm, my God, that wine looks so good.
Mmm, it is.
(CHUCKLES)
You should just have a glass.
One won't do anything.
I know, I know.
I'm just a little paranoid, especially after coming back from the hospital, you know.
Yeah.
Plus, Mom would freak.
She's obsessed. If she had her way, I would completely be on bed rest... which, actually, does not sound so bad because, oh, my God, my feet are killing me.
I keep hearing about some burst of energy during the second trimester.
Still waiting.
(GROANING)
Oh...
Are you okay?
Oh.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Yeah, I just feel like this glass of wine is getting me light-headed or something.
Oh, good, good.
Drink up for the two of us.

What is all of this?
Sit down.
Where's Juanita?
I sent her away.
You know I don't like anyone else cooking in my kitchen.
You can't send her away.
She lives here.
She works for me.
Not anymore.
Sit down.
Eat it.
I'm not hungry.
I won't ask again.
I slaved for hours in that kitchen, baking these cakes for you.
And what do you do to repay me?
You leave me all by myself.
All alone.
All day.
Look, I have to work.
Everybody leaves.
First your father...
No, my father didn't leave.
He was murdered. I saw it.
Who brought all this wickedness into our lives?
You.
I was fine until you were born.
All my troubles came with you.
Who told you to stop eating?
Well?
It's good.
Do you love me?
Liar.
If you loved me, you wouldn't have put me away for 21 years.
You were sick.
You said so yourself.
I was sick.
Now I'm sorry.
Sorry I was too weak to kill you when I had the chance.
