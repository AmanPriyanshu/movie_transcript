Hey, Doc. Everything okay?
I went to check on your blood work and there's no record of you signing in.
This isn't the sort of thing you wait around on.
Otis, you need to get the test.
I don't want to know.
Let me manage Molly's for you.
I will get your percentages back up.
I got great vendors to bring to the table.
This could really work out.
"Casey with his wife by his side."
I hope nobody at headquarters saw that caption.
That why you two haven't tied the knot?
But truth is, I like things the way they are.
I'm happier than I've been in a long time.
(GROANING)
(BOTH PANTING)
You're amazing.
(LAUGHING)
What's wrong with us?
We should do that all the time.
We used to spend mornings like this, then stop at Over Easy on the way to work.
Want to go now?
Get some Dream Pancakes?
Hell, yeah.
Let's' do it.
Ah, wait.
I can't. I've got that youth center proposal.
(GROANS)
Maybe after?
(SIGHS) It's, um...
It's probably cutting it too close, work-wise.
Yeah.
Kick some ass. Get that center approved.
Over Easy another day.
Deal.

I'm telling you, Herrmann, all the best bars are moving in this direction.
It is the future.
Uh, we already got an ice maker.
Yeah, but that's for...
That's little chunks of frozen slush.
What I am talking about, are artisanal ice cubes.
Look, Severide knows.
Severide, you ever order a scotch on the rocks, and they bring you one, giant, perfectly clear ice cube?
Yeah.
So it's pretty awesome, right?
Yeah, it keeps the drink cold.
(SNORTS)
If that's what you mean.
(LAUGHING) A ringing endorsement.
Ha! Artisanal ice cubes.

Hey, thanks. Thanks a ton.

We'll finish up here, meet you back at the house.
You sure?
Yeah.
Hi, honey. What's your name?
I'm Gabby.
Severide.
Want to tell me what happened up there?
We felt what we thought was a victim trapped between the bed and the wall.
Smoke was really thick, Chief.
We pulled the bed out, turned out to be a false alarm.
By that time, the fire cut off our exit route.
What'd it turn out to be behind the bed?
(CHUCKLES)
It was a life-sized bust of Darth Vader.
Great save, guys. Obi-Wan taught you well.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Chief, we wouldn't have wasted that time if we had those next-gen SCBA face pieces.
You seen these things?
Built-in heads-up display, thermal imaging.
It's real cutting edge.
I'll talk to headquarters.
Thanks, Chief.
Otis, what is wrong with this picture?
Don't take the bait.
Well...
Air bubbles. That's what's wrong.
'Cause, look, normal ice cubes get cloudy because they got air bubbles trapped inside of them.
You got air bubbles trapped in your head.
We should be serving giant, perfectly clear cocktail ice cubes at Molly's, don't you think?
She calls them "artesian ice cubes."
Nope. No, she doesn't.
Artisanal.
They make 'em in special freezers that cost thousands of dollars.
But my friend Gary, who is some kind of engineering genius, modified a commercial ice maker to do the same exact thing, and we can have it for just $500.
500...
You gotta be kidding me. No way.
That's not gonna happen.
Hey, Otis, you got a second, buddy?
Hold on, Cruz. You mind?
We're just in the middle of something, real quick.
What do you say, Otis? Hmm, sound good, thumbs up?
I guess, Herrmann and Dawson... ow!
Ow!
Kind of important.
Okay, okay.
Sorry.
Otis is onboard.
He did not say that!
What's the deal with you chickening out of a blood test?
And why do I have to hear about it from Brett?
You can't come to me?
Brett's blowing the whole thing out of proportion.
It's not a big deal.
So you took the blood test?
I didn't need to.
The bruises went away on their own; it's all good.
But next rash or sniffle I get, you'll be the first to know.
All clear.
You're in good shape, buddy.
Hey, way to go!
Yeah!
I want blankie.
We don't have your blanket, remember?
I bet we left it at your home, buddy.
Mom's still coming down.
She's not in any shape to see him yet.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Dawson, DCFS is here about the boy.
Louie was being fostered by Gina Waters.
She's not his mother.
Now I know your name! Louie.
That's a good one.
He's not going back there, is he?
No.
I just saw his file.
Neighbors had called with complaints and we were planning to investigate, but unfortunately the agency is a little overwhelmed right now.
Where will he go?
I'll take him to the Stevens Center Group Home while we try and find him a new foster family.
He was asking for his blanket.
Probably left it at the apartment.
We have plenty of blankets at the center.
Okay.
Okay, Louie.
It's time to go with Miss Cantrell now.
Louie, you and me are going to go play together.
It's gonna be okay, Louie.
Dawson still isn't back?
No, not yet.
Hey, Severide, I put in a call about those new masks.
You didn't tell me they cost over 2 grand apiece.
I didn't know that.
All the same, they'll save lives.
They're telling me there's no money in the budget for 'em.
CFD already spent their budget for the year?
No idea.
You trying to get the new thermal imaging masks?
Those things are incredible, Chief.
Look, I'm just telling you what Chief Barr told me.
Barr is the chief of Apparatus and Equipment??
That guy earned his rank riding a desk.
He needs to talk to somebody who eats smoke for a living.
And what can go wrong?
Hey.
There you are.
How was it?
Whole thing turned into a DCFS mess at the hospital.
The boy, Louie, he was a foster kid.
Poor guy.
Hey, you did great with him at the scene, Dawson.
You kept him nice and calm. Ain't easy to do.
I tried.
He kept crying for his blanket he left back at the apartment.
Kid's been moved around so much, it's probably the only real belonging he's got.
Let's take a ride.
Come on, guys.
We dive out onto the aerial, a couple seconds later, boom, the roof gives way.
The whole top floor is toast.
I'm lucky to be sitting here right now.
What was behind the bed?
The point is, we would have got out of there a hell of a lot sooner if we had had these masks.
Look, I know you guys like to have the newest, shiniest toys, but those things cost an arm and a leg.
Chief, I'm talking about technology that's gonna save lives... firefighters and civilians.
I understand.
But I'm telling you that the money isn't there.
How can the budget be maxed out?
We're not even halfway through the year.
I haven't heard of any major new equipment allocations.
Well, Lieutenant, there's a lot you don't know about how budgets and allocations work.
Why don't you help me understand?
You got an alderman in your house now, don't you?
Why are you breaking my balls?
Get him to explain it to you.
Thanks for your time, Chief.
You got it, Kelly.
So listen, Herrmann, I think that it's something you should at least be considering.
I read an article, and the thing is, I mean, have you seen the stats on U.S. beer consumption?
It's way down, whereas cocktails are way up!
Read about that. It's confounding.
Hey, you're gonna need a tiebreaker.
Right?
Come on, Dawson, help a sister out.
Yeah, sure. Sounds good.
Say hey to Louie for us.
Dawson's onboard.
She didn't say that.
This is so thoughtful of you.
Well, Louie seemed pretty attached.
I noticed.
He didn't take his eyes off of you.
Oh, I... (LAUGHS)
I meant to the blanket.
Oh, yes.
Well, I'll make sure he gets it for bedtime tonight.
Great.
Um... he doesn't have any family?
None on record.
Birth mom was an addict, gave him up when he was an infant.
Damn.
Kid can't catch a break.
Because of what he's been through, he's going to need special attention, so he might be difficult to place, but he's still young enough, he's got a shot.
We'll do our best.
Hope so.
He deserves that.
Okay, wait a minute. I-I'm sorry.
I'm not understanding the metaphor.
What did we do wrong?
Okay, we tried to handle this the easy way.
We sent in our drones. They missed the target.
So now it's time to put boots on the ground.
If he said the bruising has gone away...
I don't buy it.
Otis gets a hangnail, he doesn't shut up about it for a week.
This he says is nothing?
Okay, how do we put the boots on the ground?
We bring in the Green Berets.

He's tachycardic.
Hey, if you guys know something, you gotta tell us.
Tell us what happened now, or your friend could die.
Aaron, tell him.
It was just a dare.
We were gonna post it on YouTube.
But we didn't think drinking a bottle would hurt him.
A bottle? What type of alcohol?
It wasn't alcohol. It was soy sauce.
This much.
It's 20 ounces.
That much sodium, he could be hypernatremic.
We need to get fluids going fast.
Will that fix him?
There's no way to know.
Sodium overdoses can be fatal.
We wanted to call 911 as soon as he started throwing up, but he told us he was fine.
The way I understand it, a certain amount of money is allocated for fire and police, and anything left over gets diverted to political funds.
So maybe Chief Barr is under pressure from Alderman Hilbert not to spend all of his budget.
Alderman Hilbert?
Chairman of the Police and Fire Committee.
So money for Fire and Police ends up getting used for something else altogether.
Correct.
So that's it?
No masks, no matter how many lives they might save?
I don't know.
I'm putting together a youth center proposal with a guy on Hilbert's committee.
Maybe he can help me put pressure on Hilbert, get him to spend that money where it should be spent.

Yes, David. How's it going?
Good, good. Listen...
Alderman Casey.
Hey.
Hey.
So Otis hasn't even looked at me since we brought Baba in.
You know, we had a call today.
A college kid drank a bottle of soy sauce on a dare.
By the time we dropped him at the hospital, he was in a coma.
I don't think he'll make it.
Wow, that's rough.
His friends waited too long to call it in, 'cause the kid kept saying he was fine.
We did the right thing.
Ha ha, here we go.
Batch number one.
Like diamonds, right?
If diamonds were worthless.
Herrmann, these are not worthless.
People pay extra for these.
Seriously?
Like... how much extra? A dollar?
No, maybe on Rush Street, but here?
We could probably get 50¢.
50 whole cents?
Let me break it down.
So we sell about 100 cocktails a night on average.
Pop one of these in each glass, that's 50 extra bucks a night.
Herrmann, this machine pays for itself in two weeks.
From then on?
Pure profit.
Looks pretty damn good.
Yeah, melts slower so your drink stays cold, doesn't get watered down.
Yep, that's cold.
Okay, so how much extra would you be willing to pay for a premium cube like that?
Uh... a quarter?
50¢?
Yeah. Yeah, 50¢.

You did good.

Don't forget it.
(ROCK MUSIC ON JUKEBOX)
Brian, I'm glad you finally came in...
Is it leukemia?
No.
Because of your concern, we tested for that.
But we're dealing with a serious condition, called Immune thrombocytopenia, okay, or ITP.
It's a platelet disorder.
Never heard of it, so how serious can it be, right?
Your body is low on platelets, so your blood isn't clotting properly, hence the bruising you saw.
You're very lucky it hasn't caused any real damage.
When untreated, it can lead to bleeding in the brain.
What's the treatment?
Well, we have a couple options going forward, corticosteroids, and/or intravenous infusions of immune globulin.
We're going to determine what works best for you.
"Immune globulin"?
Sounds like a villain from "Star Trek."
But he can still report to work, right?
Not right now.
No, we need to get that platelet count normalized.
But I'll be back on the job soon, right?
We can't know that for sure right now.
We'll see how the treatment goes.
Thanks, Will.
You got it.
