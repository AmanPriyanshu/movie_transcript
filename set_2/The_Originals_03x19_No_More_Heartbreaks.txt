: Previously on The Originals...
: If this prophecy is fulfilled, you will all fall.
One by friend, one by foe, and one by family.
(Grunts)
The Ancestors are doing this to you.
You have to get out of this city, somewhere where they can't reach you.
(Gasping in pain)
(Panting)
Did Nik ever mention to you what happens when a vampire goes into a room without being invited?
(Screaming)
Let her go!
: Aurora's still out cold.
What are the chances of keeping her that way?
Well, my spell will keep her down.
Covens will never know peace with the Mikaelsons living here.
Now, my guess is, the Ancestors see Lucien as a weapon.
This transformed me into something new.
My bite is lethal.
(Screams)
(Indistinct chatter, traffic in distance)
Ah.
All the makings of a lovely day.
(Gasps)
Ah, Camille! Finally awake.
Perfect.
You've got a big day ahead of you.
You bit me.
And sampled quite a bit of your blood, actually.
It was very tasty.
Although more bitter than I expected.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die.
Yeah.
Apologies.
But, to be honest, your days were numbered the moment you caught Nik's eye.
'Tis ever thus for those who get close to the b*st*rd.
Myself excluded.
(Whistling)
Ah. Care for tea?
Oh, please, Cami.
Have you not learned?
If you try to fight me, you will always lose.
(Groans)
(Sighs)
Enough.
If you insist on making things difficult...
(Grunts)
(Sighs)
(Panting)
: Klaus?
(Panting)
Klaus?
What is it?
Something happened and you're gonna be angry, but Lucien wants you to be angry.
He's trying to lure you into a trap.
What did he do?
Promise me you won't fly off the handle and do something crazy.
Promise me.
Before you lose it...
Klaus... look at me.
I love you.
And I won't let you get yourself killed.
Camille...
(Gasping)
I just needed you to know.
I can tell you I love you tomorrow.
You're not dying today.
(Buzzing whine)
(Muffled): Cami?
Cami.
(Buzzing whine continues)
Cami...
(Buzzing stops)
Hey.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Considering.
Hold still.
This is going to burn.
(Gasps) Ow.
Ow, what is that?
It's a healing salve. Motherwort.
White willow bark.
The recipe's over 1,000 years old.
So, the good stuff, huh?
Well, it will ease the pain, dull the symptoms, but... it won't stop the infection.
So I'm screwed.
We're gonna do everything that we can, Cami.
: To that end, a little assistance.
Cami, I'm so sorry.
You should be.
This is your fault.
It was you who turned Lucien into a beast.
: Klaus. Stop.
It's not his fault.
: Cami's right.
We all need to work together to fix this.
: Yeah.
Yeah, I think I know how to fix it.
Lucien has always been obsessed with me.
He made himself like me.
My bite is cured by my blood.
Do you think his blood can save her?
: It makes sense.
Lucien would want that power.
Allowing him to lord himself over his victims.
Okay, so we got a working theory. Now we gotta test it.
Lucien's blood is all over my apartment.
I sliced him all to hell before I ran.
Okay, I got this one.
Lucien's got no reason to be on the lookout for me.
Maybe... maybe we hedge our bets.
Hope is a Mikaelson witch who carries the wolf gene.
We already know that she has healing power.
It's worth a try.
I'll tell Mary that I'm coming.
(Ship's horn blares)
: You just leave?
No good-bye, nothing.
What are you doing here?
I tried to use magic to track you.
Then I realized you were hiding somewhere magic couldn't reach.
Davina, you should go.
Why would you leave without telling me?
Why would you come back if you weren't going to tell me?
Why are you walking away?
I didn't want to go.
Nor was it my intention to come back.
The Ancestors won't let me leave.
The second I got to the city limits, I started to desiccate.
I'm cursed, luv.
Those witch spirits have their hooks deep inside of me.
They allow me no peace, just a hunger that I can't control.
Look, there's got to be a fix.
Just promise you'll never leave me again.
(Phone buzzing)
I'm in the middle of something.
Davina, we have a situation.
Lucien went after Cami.
Now, she managed to get away, but he bit her.
What? Is she...?
: No, no, no, no. She's still alive.
Klaus is with her at the compound.
I'm headed there now. Let me come get you.
No.
I'll meet you there.
Be careful. All right?
Lucien could be anywhere.
Klaus?
You should be laying down.
You should be getting me soup.
It's the one advantage to being sick.
Or we could just stand here and stare at your comatose ex.
I was wrong to deny you the satisfaction of revenge.
I know I'm supposed to be this big, bad vampire, but all of the sudden, I'm not so hung up on "revenge."
Am I angry at what Aurora did to me?
Yeah.
And I've been living in fear of what else she might do.
But... all of that anger and fear, that's not me.
I'm the kind of person that helps people like Aurora.
I'm not gonna let her take that away from me.
: I'm not arguing with you.
If I'm gonna help Cami, I need to go right to the source of the problem.
Lucien is an unstoppable monster made by the Ancestors.
I have stood up to Klaus.
I'm not afraid of some second-string copycat.
But I can't leave here.
And I am not letting you walk into a fight by yourself.
Let go.
You can barely control yourself.
Now, if Lucien's working with the Ancestors, maybe he can tell me what they've done to you.
This is madness. You can't fight him!
I don't need to fight him.
I need him to tell me the truth.
And I know a way to do that.
So just stay here, wish me luck.
Davina!
Davina!
This will help slow the spread of the infection.
In the meantime, you need to keep her relaxed.
My talents do not lend themselves to playing nursemaid.
Do you care about her?
Figure it out.
(Distant conversations)
It really is a beautiful day.
Well, perhaps once we've got all this sorted, we can go for a stroll.
My sister gave me this concoction.
She assures me it will put you on the mend.
(Sniffs)
Unfortunately, she's not quite the mixologist you are.
(Sniffs, groans)
If I am really am dying, there's no way that's gonna be my last drink.
What can I get you?
Bourbon.
Neat.
Neat?
Either you're extremely sophisticated or you've had one hell of a day.
Need the two be mutually exclusive?
I loved being a bartender.
That endless parade of faces...
Each night, someone new would come in with a good story.
One guy's shy, the other won't shut up.
Cheers.
(Places glass down)
I used to think if you just give someone a little booze, they'll tell you anything.
Then I realized it wasn't the alcohol.
People just want someone to listen.
Yes, well, you're quite adept at listening.
In fact, I would so far as to call you a connoisseur of stories.
Particularly mine.
I should've published your memoir.
I would've made a fortune.
Hey, will you do something for me?
You'd think with current events, I would've written a will.
But no time like the present.
Will you write a few things down?
Camille.
Look, I've made my peace with dying.
I just... don't want to leave any loose ends, so...
Besides...
I was your stenographer.
You owe me.
(Footsteps)
(Sighs) What the hell, man?
Elijah called. Said you'd be here.
I came to watch your back.
How is she?
How you think she is?
She got pulled into a vampire vendetta, and now if we can't make this work, she's gonna die, so she's scared, she's angry, and right about now, she's probably wishing that she never set foot in the Quarter.
(Sighs)
You care about her.
So do I.
And I know you want to help her, so focus.
Do what you got to do.
Yeah.
(Chanting in ancient language)
(Gasps)
Vincent? What's wrong?
(Mumbles)
Ooh...
The Ancestors are fickle.
They don't want me using magic, because they know I sided with vampires.
Come on.
(Dance music playing)
(Indistinct chatter)
Ah!
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
(Crowd cheering)
Come on, let the Mikaelsons hear you!
(Crowd cheering)
Even now they hide in their dreadful outdated fortress, while we celebrate the liberation of New Orleans!
(Cheering)
Klaus' tenure is at an end.
I expect he will arrive soon enough, seeking his retribution.
And when he does, our real party can begin!
(Cheering)

Tossing about sleeping spells.
Rather clever, if somewhat of a buzzkill.

Oh, did you honestly bring your favorite doll to a bar fight?
The Figure Veritas will make sure the next words you speak are the truth.

To Davina, I leave everything in my closet.
Just nothing too revealing.
To Josh, my records.
To Vincent... my books and all of Kieran's files.
To Elijah, I have an old game of Trivial Pursuit under my bed.
(Short laugh)
To Hayley, my dark objects.
Will you make sure that she gives them to Hope when she's old enough?
Hope's a New Orleans witch.
She should have them.
And to you...
Enough! This is-is pointless.
We're going to find a way to fix it.
I suppose I should just fess up.
Tell you all my deepest, darkest secrets.
I'm a Scorpio.
I prefer wine to whisky.
Got a bit of a sweet tooth.
Um... oh, my greatest joy is listening to the screams of my victims just before I end them.
Tell me how to cure Cami!
So persistent.
No wonder The Ancestors find you so annoying.
How splendid that they have a plan to shut you up for good.
(Indistinct whispering)
Oh, no need to point that hideous thing at me, luv.
I'm happy to tell you whatever you want to know.
How are you doing this?
Oh, not me, luv.
I've got The Ancestors on my side.
Ready with a wealth of witchy woes for those who oppose me.
(Door opens)
Come in.
How is she?
(Groans)
Let's just hopes this works.
: Why would The Ancestors help you?
I made them a promise.
See, if they help me, we'd exterminate a certain family of vermin vampires.
Innocents may get caught in the crossfire.
(Coughing)
Here, drink this.
: You silly fools with your unbridled optimism! Always hoping there's some way out. Some loophole to save you from your doom.
Well, the thing is I don't believe in loopholes.
My bite has no cure.
Your sweet Camille is going to die.
Mary doesn't want vampires near her cabin.
It's probably better if you just stay here.
She's aware that you and Hope are under my protection.
Unfortunately for Mary, that didn't do much for her grandson, did it?
You know I couldn't prevent that.
Yes, I do.
But here we are again with someone else's life on the life.
Only this time I'm taking my two-year-old daughter into a warzone on the off chance that it might save my friend from dying.
I mean, do see how insane our lives have become?
What do you want me to do?
I don't know.
I just can't keep losing people.
First Jack.
Now we might lose Cami.
Who's next?
Klaus?
Me?
You?
I'm not afraid to die.
Neither are you.
We fight for those we love.
(Footsteps approaching)
Perfect day at a corner cafe.
You really outdid yourself.
If only it were real.
It will do to pass the time while we wait for the cure to take effect.
And then tomorrow when you're recovered, we can travel anywhere you like.
Perhaps we'll go to Santorini for some vinsanto or to Rome for the perfect espresso.
I've always wanted to go to Venice.
Ride in a gondola down the Grand Canal.
Well, then we must start there.
(Laughs)
I wish I had known you were such a romantic.
I wouldn't have played so hard to get.
Let us not speak of regrets.
We are in the perfect moment of the perfect day.
Let's try to enjoy it.
♪ ♪
She's getting worse.
Okay, then we, uh, we got to try something else!
Marcel?
The Strix?
You mean to tell me they can't help with this?
The Strix don't have a solution for something that's never existed before.
Lucien engineered a pure strain of wolf venom.
Designed to kill even an Original.
It may be there is no cure.
Well, I'm not giving up.
Neither am I, but...
Okay, um... blood magic's not working.
So what else is there?
How about a magical miracle baby?
(Blade clinks)
You are going to wake them, aren't you?
I've got a party to finish.
Go to hell.
Ah.
Still smarting over the whole Cami thing?
Well, if you wanted a happier tale, perhaps you should've inquired about my recent vacation to the Maldives.
Why are you doing this?
Because I can.
If you have some sick rivalry with Klaus, then you guys can compete to see who's most miserable, but you don't have to hurt Cami.
Of course I do!
Nik stole the love of my life!
(Laughs)
A shattering defeat for most men.
But I have since realized that love simply makes one weak.
And I can prove it.
When Cami dies, Nik will be struck by such overpowering grief, he will lash out at me.
But I, being unencumbered by something so mawkish as a romantic attachment, will end him.
Now, since I have been so kind as to answer all your questions and you are by no means capable of stopping me, could you be so kind as to please go on your way?
Why are you letting me go?
Ah, my darling... you are not mine to kill.
The Ancestors have something else in store for you.
You should ask your boyfriend Kol about it.
: This is my favorite time of day.
(Jazz saxophone playing)
You can feel the city coming alive.
The lights turn on, the music cranks up...
It's lovely, save for the incessant parade of inebriated buffoons.
I should have omitted them when I conjured this.
You don't get to delete the details that annoy you.
If you love something, you have to accept the good with the bad.
I prefer to shape reality to my will.
That's a far better practice than simply accepting what's been offered.
Even you don't get to micromanage the world.
Besides, it's an unhealthy impulse.
It is for those who'd defy me.
Healthy, happy people get by just fine when they don't get their way.
The whole revenge thing, the obsession with power... it's all rooted in fear.
I've been around 1,000 years.
I've endured as many horrors as I've committed.
What could I possibly have to fear?
For one, you're afraid of what will happen when I'm gone.
I don't want to talk about this.
I'm just trying to enjoy my perfect day.
And I will be able to, if you allow me make my point.
Do you remember when we first met?
You were so damaged.
Manipulative.
People were just things that you used to get what you wanted.
(Laughs) That's a harsh appraisal.
Though, I admit accurate.
But you wanted to show me you were more than that.
So you showed me your whole life.
You wanted to be understood, Klaus.
That's a human impulse, and if you're capable of that after everything you've been through, then you're capable of everything else that comes with being human: joy, hope, love.
Do you know that, Klaus?
You are loved.
By Elijah. Rebekah. Freya.
Why are you telling me this?
Because love will make you strong.
It will make you the man that I know you want to be.
And you're gonna have to remember that... because I won't to be here to remind you.
Hey, hey.
Look at me.
It's gonna be okay.
You lied to me.
I warned you there would be consequences.
The Ancestors tampered with the spell I used to bring you back.
We knew that.
But you didn't tell me how.
It was a dark spell to begin with.
They want you to kill me, right?
They want revenge.
Why didn't you say something?
What would you have me say?
"Thank you for saving me from unending torment, I adore you with all my heart. Oh, and by the way, all I want to do is rip out your throat."
And the longer I hold out, the worse it gets.
I can protect myself.
No.
Eventually, I'll give in.
But there is another way.
♪ ♪
Where did you find that?
The first thing I did when you brought me back was to hunt it down, to make sure that Nik wouldn't stick it in me the second I annoyed him.
I have always hated these bloody things.
But we've run out of options.
No. I can fix you.
I know you can.
But this is to make certain that you're safe until you do.
All right, think of it as a short sleep.
(Sniffs)
Easy to endure, knowing that you'll be waiting when I wake.
Safe and sound.
This isn't fair.
I've waited so long to have you back.
Wait a little longer, bring me back when my mind is right.
As it is, you can't trust me, which means you can't love me.
Not as I love you.
(Gasping)
Ah...
(Choking)
Anything?
I've tried everything that I know, including the power that resides in the blood of our niece.
The infection has spread everywhere.
There's nothing more we can do.
Klaus can ease her suffering, but... she won't last much longer.
Freya, we gotta do something. All right?
So channel me, cast a healing spell, and that'll buy us enough time...
It won't stop the inevitable.
Okay, then put her soul in that damn pendant.
It worked for Finn, it will work...
Dahlia crafted the pendant.
It will only work for our family.
I could put her soul in another body...
No. She'd have to agree for the transfer to hold and she wouldn't do that to an innocent person.
Not even to save herself.
Well, maybe we worry about that later.
We cannot deny her the dignity of choice.
Camille lived with grace.
She will have it now.
