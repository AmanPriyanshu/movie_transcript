: Martha's seen me.
Did you want her to?
I didn't... I didn't know what else to do.
: I need to be able just to... just reach my husband.
I'm sorry. There's a lot going on.
I love you.
Tell me Tuesday.
(lowered voice) you wanna find out who really planted that bug?
Help me track Martha.
A few scattered relationships, nothing long term.
And then this new boyfriend.
You got a name?
Clark Westerfeld.
If the FBI gets to her...
Will you listen to me?
Martha is done.
I'm never going home, am I?
: I just had an emergency signal from William.
They can get a sample from its tissue.
Where's Clark?
Something unexpected came up.
He'll be back shortly.
Martha, come back to the house now.
You stay away from me. I'll scream, and everybody will know that you're KGB.
Good. You're here.
We have a problem.
Martha is gone.
What?
Gone?
Gone? Gone where?
I don't know.
How?
She ran out.
I went after her, tried talking to her.
She stood on the street, threatening to scream "KGB."
I'm sorry.
(sighs)
When did this happen?
It's been 40 minutes.
Any idea where she might have gone?
No.
All right.
Let's think.
(refrigerator door closes)
If you were her husband...
I don't know.
Rock Creek Park, the zoo.
She likes watching the panda cubs.
That's it?
(sighs)
We went to the Tidal Basin once to look at the cherry blossoms.
She always talked about that.
When she first moved to D.C., she lived near the Capitol, so downtown maybe.
She goes to church at First Trinity.
Anywhere else?
Uh... Foundry Branch, Capital Crescent Trail.
We went for a picnic there once. It was...
Start with First Trinity, then the Tidal Basin.
This is a big city. She could be anywhere.
She's seen your face.
You and Hans should look.
I should wait by the phone 'cause if Martha calls to leave a message, I need to be the one who answers.
I'll get an address and tell her you're on your way.
I'll get Hans.
If you find her, bring her back.
If it's in public and she starts screaming again... well, you may have no choice.
Excuse us.
(telephone rings in distance)
We got a call from Minneapolis.
An agent in Bismarck did a cemetery walk.
Found Clark Westerfeld's "dead twin"... a 7-year-old boy who died in a car accident 30 years ago.
Dead kid's birth date and Westerfeld's are a match?
We have Westerfeld's driver's license information from his lease.
Same D.O.B.
So, Martha's boyfriend has a fake identity.
Well, that's it, then.
I'm sorry, sir.
Uh, get a sketch artist. See if Carlotti's available.
And bring in the super of "Clark Westerfeld's" building.

Sir?

Blackmail is not gonna work with him, sir.
Well, maybe it'll work, maybe it won't work, but, uh, if there's any chance of getting Martha back, you got to try it.
I understand that. I do.
But... this guy, he's not cut like that.
We have to play the long game with him.
There's no long game, Agent Beeman.
Use the goddamn tape.
All that would do is wreck the operation, sir.
