Are you Emma's mom?
I am.
What are you doing here?
I have something for Emma, and it doesn't concern you.
There's something I need to get to Emma, and her father won't let me see her.
No, I can't do that.
It's funny, you and I, that we're here, and we're happy.
[heavy breathing]
 they create other personas who can deal with it better.
She doesn't want me to talk to you.
Why don't you want him to talk for himself?
Because there's things that he does not need to remember, and I have worked very hard to make him forget about these things, and I don't need you undoing it.
Don't make him remember these things, or I will have to do something about it.
It happened again?
You blacked out in our session yesterday.
Norman, um... one thing therapists don't always like to tell their patients is that sometimes, for things to get better, they have to feel worse first.
I can't make that not true for you, but I can make sure you don't starve.
[heavy breathing]
Good morning.
 good morning.
[both laugh]
Alex?
Do you mind?
Oh, no.
Yeah, I'll start the coffee.
[clock ticking]
What are you making?
Self-portrait.
[chuckles]
I need some air.
I don't know who thought it was a good idea for a bunch of medicated psychos to spend the morning inhaling glue.
Nice cat, by the way.
It's a dog.
It's cute that you care.
[indistinct chatter]
[crackling electricity]
Oh, hey. There you are.
Hi.
Heading to work. What you got there?
I was thinking about making some new curtains for the kitchen and maybe the living room.
Wanted to since I moved in.
I thought maybe if I buy the fabric wholesale and do it myself...
You're gonna make curtains.
Yeah, I use to make my own clothes in high school.
This house is so cool. I mean, look at this.
Lookit, this is a frickin' fruit cellar if you just wiped all this junk away.
I always wanted to plant more fruit trees and preserve fruit.
There's so much I want to do.
Well, we could do that. I'll help you.
Really?
Yeah. Yeah... well, I can't make curtains, but I can plant a tree.
Yeah, I'll start this weekend.
All right. I gotta go, but just start thinking about what kind of fruit trees you want to pick, and I'll go buy them and whatever else you need.
Yeah?
Alex?
Yeah?
Don't worry about it.
What? Why?
It's... I'm...
I don't want you spending your money on it.
That's not what I was asking.
Oh, come on. I don't mind.
Yeah, but that's not why I brought it up.
It's so silly.
I don't really have any money.
You know, we haven't really had enough guests since they put the road in to even break even.
I'm behind on a lot of bills, so the last thing I should be thinking about is home improvements. It's bad accounting.
Norma, why didn't you tell me?
Because it's embarrassing.
I was so excited when I first showed Norman this place.
I had so many ideas on how to fix it.
It's an amazing house, and I just kind of gave up on it, but...
I feel like taking it on.
So I'm gonna start with the curtains, and then we can work on it one thing at a time.
There's no rush. Mm-kay?
And I know things will pick up in the spring, and, you know, this... what are you doing?
Remember that day I told you I was hiding a bunch of money down here?
Yeah.
Well, I actually was.
[stifling laughter]
Open it.
[laughs]
Where did you get this?
It was Bob Paris' getaway cash.
Oh, I... no, I can't do that.
Well, it would help me 'cause I don't know what to do with it.
Look, this money... it doesn't belong to anybody, and who knows how he got it?
And, honestly, I couldn't think of a better use for it than to put it back out in the world through your hands.
You've had nothing but bad breaks since you moved here.
And you deserve some good ones.
I mean, think of it like it's like a balancing of the scales.
Some positive karma.
Please take it. It'll help me.
I wish we could just erase all the bad things that have happened.
[telephone ringing]
Okay, what jerk invented the phone?
[telephone ringing]
Hello?
Hello. Uh, is my mother there?
Uh, yeah, she's right here, Norman.
Hi, honey.
Everything okay, Mother?
Of course. Why wouldn't it be?
Oh, the sheriff is there answering your phone, so I thought maybe you were in trouble or something.
No, no, uh, the stained-glass window in the hallway needed to be replaced, so he... he just stopped by and helped me 
Norman?
Mother, I'm coming home.
What do you mean?
I'm coming home.
Is that... is that something that you can just do?
I can leave whenever I want.
[mouthing word]
Has something happened, Norman?
No. No, no.
Well, Dylan said that you were doing really well.
I mean, don't you think it would be good 
Oh, well, Dr. Edwards thinks I've made significant progress and it's time for me to come home.
Of course not. I'm just surprised.
I'm sure you are.
I'll let you know when you can pick me up.
I'd like to know the procedure for checking myself out, please.
I'm a voluntary patient here.
I believe that means I can go home whenever I feel I'm ready.
Not exactly. There are protocols.
Oh.
As a voluntary patient, we ask that you write what we call a "three-day letter" formally requesting your release.
We then have 72 hours to assess whether or not you meet the release requirements.
What happens if I just stop payment?
Well, you've already been pre-approved by your insurance company for three months.
My insurance?
Well, your stepfather's.
Yes, we had to pull some strings to get you approved for coverage quite quickly.
Hmm. Oh, I see.
Yes, you've arranged payment with... with my stepfather.
I understand and... and... and very much appreciate you doing that.
Everyone here has been so very thoughtful and kind, uh, but I'm leaving, and so I will just go and prepare the necessary paperwork.
Norman.
Yeah?
Have you told Dr. Edwards your wishes?
Not yet.
I will.
I can dictate the terms!
That's not how it works with her.
She doesn't play by any rules.
Emma, please. Listen to me!
I know her.
I wish she was a different person, but she's not.
She's thinking she's got a daughter that may not die.
What that means to her, who knows?
But I guarantee you it's about her, and not about you.
[door closes]
I, uh, brought some breakfast.
We're fighting about my mother.
It's not a fight. It's a discussion.
Dylan, you can back me up here.
Audrey was a mess at the hospital, yeah?
You met my mother?
Dylan, please tell her.
Why didn't you tell me?
I...
I didn't want to upset you.
You, uh, you left this.
Thank you.
So your, uh, your... your dad finally told you that she came to the hospital.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you myself.
I should have.
But your... your dad had really strong feelings about her, and she... she seemed... she seemed complicated.
Her cell phone's no longer in service.
What?
That's what we were fighting about.
He told me about the hospital, and I tried to call her, and it was one of these automated messages...
"This phone is no longer in service" thing.
Well, m-maybe she got a new number.
Yeah, or maybe she forgot to pay the bill.
Or couldn't afford it.
Or just didn't bother telling us she changed it.
I can't help that she's my mother and she reached out, and I... I want to see her, but I just don't know where she is.
[knocking on door]
Yeah?
Rebecca Hamilton from the bank is here to see you.
She says she has your new checks.
Asked if she could give them to you personally.
Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. Have her come in.
That's what I thought you'd say.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, you busy?
No. Yeah, we're good. Thanks.
Maybe not such a good idea for you to be showing up here.
I came here on official bank business.
For your joint checking account.
Alex Romero and Norma Bates.
And I also wanted to say good-bye.
You're leaving?
Yeah.
I'm going back to Indiana, um, to see my mom, who's not doing so well.
Nothing really keeping me here.
Um, listen, just so you know, uh, everything that we discussed worked out just fine, so thank you...
Good. I'm glad. Okay, but I told you the DEA called me about you.
You might want to be sure they don't need you before you disappear off the radar.
Alex, I need to leave.
I'm going back home to see my sick mother.
However they want to view that is up to them.
Anyway, you take care of yourself.
[keyboard keys clacking]
Norman?
What are you doing? We're supposed to be having therapy.
I want to be discharged.
I am writing a letter explaining my reasons, but I understand that I need your approval too.
I want to go home.
Can we talk about this?
Of course we can, but I'm not changing my mind.
I am willing to continue working with you on an outpatient basis, as I explain in my letter, but I just need to get home.
[sighs]
You know I have the same goal for you.
We work together, so you can safely reenter your home environment.
My blackouts have actually increased since I've been here.
Doesn't that say something?
It does, and I know it's not comfortable, but it's because we're doing the work.
With all due respect, I can't remember any of our work.
I would also like to start medication immediately.
Norman...
No, you said that it can help control the blackouts.
Medication isn't a guarantee that I'll sign your release.
And what happens if you don't?
I file an affidavit with the court saying that I think you may be a danger to yourself or others.
I am reasonably requesting to be prescribed something that you yourself have said in the past might help me.
A-are you now refusing to do that?
Should I make a note in my letter to that effect?
[deep breath]
Finish your letter, Norman, but we're not done with this.
Hello?
[door closes]
[low rumbling]
[lid clanging]
Norma?
[sewing machine rattling]
Norma?
Dylan!
Come in. I'm making curtains.
Someone downstairs is making jam.
I'm making that too.
And I'm gonna clean up the basement after this.
Why all the sudden home improvements?
Because Alex is helping me fix the place up.
I'm so excited.
I've wanted to for years, and now I can do it.
Will you help me, honey?
Hey, I had a fun idea.
Why don't you and Emma join me to get the tree this year?
Hmm? You guys are moving so soon.
I thought it'd be a nice thing for us to do together.
Yeah, sure.
That would be so great.
Okay.
Hey, how's... how's Norman?
How's Norman?
Hmm?
Oh.
He said he wants to come home.
You know, I won't let him. It's not time.
He's just homesick.
I'll talk some sense into him when I see him tomorrow.
You can't let him come home.
That's what I just said.
Don't be dramatic.
[sewing machine pounding]
[machine and music both stop]
I need to tell you something.
Oh, my God. Did Emma die?
What? Y... No. Jesus, Norma.
No, I just told you we'd go to the Christmas tree thing.
Oh, right.
Did you know that Norman had this letter?
It's... it's meant for Emma. It's from her mom, and, uh, I found it here the other day.
Here where?
In here. In... in Norman's room.
That's a weird place for it to be.
Well... Let me see it.
Do you think that maybe she gave it to him when she stayed at the motel?
Emma's mom stayed at the motel?
Norma, her name was in the computer.
What are you trying to do? Trap me in a lie or something?
Why are you lying to me? Why didn't you just tell me that Audrey stayed at the motel?
I didn't want to say anything because the woman seemed like she was a mess.
She was unstable. Fishing for information on Emma.
I didn't want to get in the middle of it.
You know what? Fine.
But why did Norman have this letter?
Oh, she tried to give it to me too.
I wouldn't take it. I-I guess she gave it to Norman.
Wait, you mean they were alone together?
You know that she never officially checked out.
What are you trying to say?
You know what I'm trying to say.
Okay, so say it. Say it out loud, 'cause it is gonna sound really stupid.
Norma...
Say it, Dylan!
Norman has a... he's got a violent side.
All right? And... and I think that he does things, and he doesn't know that he's done them.
That's a pretty liberal accusation based on a whole lot of nothing.
Seriously? I mean...
I... okay.
I agree, this is weird that it was in here, but y-you know Norman. He has so much empathy.
He was probably just trying to help her out.
So I'd forget about it if I were you.
Yeah, well, you're not me, okay?
And I care about Emma, and I'm not just gonna let it go.
All right? Audrey came by the hospital, and then she came here, but now Emma hasn't heard from her since, and her phone's been disconnected, so I'm trying to find her.
Okay. Whatever.
Do what you think you got to do. 
Fine. I will.
And I wouldn't let him come home.
I already said I wouldn't!
All right. Bye, Norma.
[Norma moaning]
[loud clatter]
Did you start your meds?
Yeah.
You sleep?
Not really.
Yeah, well, that'll go away.
You may even sleep more.
I think I'll sleep better when I'm home in my own bed.
You gonna miss your mommy tucking you in?
It's a joke, dude. Lighten up.
I'm... I'm sorry if you're homesick.
Oh, no. I'm not homesick, Julian.
I'm going home.
Seriously?
Yep.
Dr. Edwards sign off on your paperwork yet?
He will.
No, he won't.
Even if he did, someone like you... you're gonna boomerang back here in one, two months, tops.
That is, of course, unless your family freaks out and dumps you back here sooner.
"Someone like me"?
Yeah, I'm... look, I know you think you're different, playing all calm and nice, but you don't wind up in a place like this just 'cause you're normal.
You're right, Julian.
I'm not normal.
But I'm also not like you.
I may be crazy like you are, but I'm smart, and I can get myself out of this place because I want to.
I know how to make the world see me as someone normal... someone kind, someone nice... and you just can't do that.
That's why you're never gonna get out of here.
It's not that I don't want him to come home.
I'm... I... I just... I thought therapy took time.
No, I...
I don't think he's ready to go home.
Oh! Okay.
I'm... I think this place is good for him, and I'm glad you're gonna make him stay.
Norma, I'm not sure you understand.
Norman does have the right to check himself out within the next 48 hours, and the only way I can circumvent that is if I petition the court and make a case as for why he might be a danger to himself or others.
He's not violent.
I didn't use the word "violent."
I'm worried about his blackouts.
Are they better?
Well, unfortunately, I can't discuss that with you, but, if you have concerns, you also have the option to petition the court.
Take custody of Norman.
Make him an involuntary admit.
So you want me to be the bad guy?
No, I don't look at it like that.
I'm... I'm just presenting you with your options.
Mm-mm.
No way. No, no. I couldn't do that to Norman.
No, I'm not gonna go behind his back.
Would it help if I spoke to him?
I'd be grateful if you tried.
You think you might... like, would it be appropriate for you to give me some pointers?
Of course. I'd be happy to.
[keypad tapping]
[phone ringing]
Northern Rose Apartments.
Yeah, hi. I'm trying to reach one of your tenants...
Uh, Audrey Decody?
Oh, what a coincidence. So am I.
Who are you?
I'm, uh... I'm a cousin. I'm just... just trying to reach her about some family issues.
Well, when you find her, tell her she's gonna have some legal issues, too, if she doesn't cough up the four months of back rent she owes me, 
Moving costs?
Yeah, she was officially evicted a week ago.
What did she leave?
Uh, everything.
Listen, are you looking for an apartment?
Otherwise, I've got stuff to do.
No, I'm good. Thanks.
[indistinct chatter]
What are you doing here, Mother?
I can't leave yet.
There's a waiting period. I said that I'd call you.
I know. I know. I'm not... I'm not here to pick you up.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud of the work that you're doing.
And... um, but, a-as much as I want you to come home too...
I-I think it might be worth it if you give it more time.
And we were so lucky to get you in this place.
"We"?
We. Yeah, "we."
We. You and me. We.
You know...
Dr. Edwards is such a good doctor, and, um... and I know you've been working hard, but real change takes time, and if you just work with him just a little longer, you'll be that much stronger when you do come home.
All right? That makes sense, doesn't it?
It does.
I'm just wondering, Mother, is this your idea or your husband's?
I perfectly understand that newlyweds often want time alone.
Is that it? If I come home now, will I be in the way of your honeymoon?
I don't know what you're talking about, Norman.
Don't embarrass yourself by lying to me.
Okay...
Yes. [scoffs]
I... okay.
It's not how it looks. Norm... it's not what you think.
Okay, I did it for the medical insurance.
I don't believe you.
Norman, no. Pineview is expensive.
You needed help, and I did it for you.
He answered our phone.
Yes.
He was in our house. Have you been sleeping with him?
What are you talking about?
I can't even believe that you are asking me this.
I can't believe you're doing it.
Don't look at me like that. I can't bear it.
Stop. Stop!
I did it for the insurance. That's it. I swear, Norman.
That's all. He is a public figure.
It has to look real. That's all it is. I swear.
I... I... I love you.
Everything I have ever done, I have done it for you.
You are my child. You are my priority.
Then prove it.
How? What?
Let me come home.
I... but I...
I don't think that that's what's best for you.
Please, Mother. Please.
I've done everything that you asked.
I came here, and I stayed, and I made an effort, and I've made progress.
Even the doctor says so.
And I'm taking medication, and I'll keep seeing Dr. Edwards.
I just can't stay here. I... I want to be home with you.
I need to come home, Mother.
Please. Please let me come home.
Oh, please.
Okay.
Of course you can come home.
I'm so sorry.
[sighs]
You can come home.
Oh, thank you.
I'll keep seeing Dr. Edwards, I promise.
[breathing heavily]
That's how I knew your mom was staying at the motel.
[paper crinkling]
I tracked down her landlord, and she said that she hadn't heard from your mom, and that your mom owed back, like, four months' rent, so they had to get rid of her stuff and evict her.
Did you read this?
I think that, you know, it seems like she wants to get to know you and make an effort.
What it says is that she wants to tell me about why she left.
What it means is that she actually wants to tell me horrible things about my dad.
Are you sure?
All that stuff you found out about the disconnected phone.
The back rent. It all makes sense.
She's broke.
She wanted to make us feel sorry for her so that we'd bail her out.
She did it a few times when I was little, until my dad finally told her to go to hell.
I can't keep pretending like I don't remember that.
She's not a very good person.
I'm such an idiot.
No, no.
No, it's fine.
I don't need someone who doesn't... who doesn't want me.
I want you.
I love you.
Oh, Nurse Penny said I could have ten more minutes.
Oh, that's fine.
Just wanted to talk to you.
May I? Uh?
Of course.
I feel like I owe you an apology.
Why?
You're smart. You're capable.
You can understand more than many of my other patients, and, as a result, I think I pushed you too hard.
No, I... I... it's fine. I don't think you did.
A couple of days ago, I felt we were on the same page.
What changed for you?
Nothing changed.
I just think that I'll be better served being in my home environment.
Are you scared to go home?
No. Of course not.
Look, I feel calmer already on the medication.
Okay, so you're calmer, but what if the blackouts still happen?
I know what you're doing.
What am I doing?
You're trying to scare me.
Don't you think you should be scared, Norman?
When you have these blackouts, you become a different person, Norman, you move differently.
You speak differently.
You experience the world differently.
You have different impulses.
Now, if that happened to me, I'd be scared.
Well, I'm not you.
No. You, Norman, are a kind, sensitive, empathetic, intelligent person.
You disassociate because that version of you hasn't been capable of navigating your world.
Now, do you really feel like you've done the work to change that?
I don't know!
Do you want me to admit I'm scared?
Yes, I'm scared.
I don't like that I can't remember.
I don't like that I go away.
But I am also glad...
Glad that I'm taking the medication...
I hope it helps... and mostly, above everything else, I am so glad that I have you.
I don't want to lose you, Dr. Edwards.
I don't want to leave here and have you not care about me.
But don't you think that it's possible that I might make even more progress if I'm near the person who makes me feel complete and whole and safe?
With you, and with her, I really think that I can get better.
I... I really, really do.
Will you please just give me this chance?
All right.
Thank you.
We're going to start with three sessions a week.
Three.
Of course.
I've got you, Norman.
I promise.
I'll sign your release.
Thank you, Dr. Edwards.
Good night, Norman.
Surprise!
You got a TV.
Yeah! Well, for you.
Okay, fine, it's for us.
[laughs] What? Oh, come on.
Well, you don't have a decent one anywhere in the house, and I know how much you like watching old movies.
I thought you might actually like seeing the picture, so I got the 60", and... hey, look, I picked up a couple of these guys.
Well, what is it? What's wrong?
I went to see Norman. I told him he could come home.
W-why would you do that?
Because he's my kid, and he really wants to come home, and he said that he'd continue working with Dr. Edwards.
Pineview's not close.
So I'll have to drive him.
Thanks for discussing it with me.
Alex, please. Please, please, please.
Don't be mad at me. Please?
You can't be mad. I can't stand it.
I can't stand... please don't be mad.
Please?
I just couldn't tell my own son he couldn't come home.
He was desperate. He was begging me. He's my son.
What could I do?
No, I understand.
He found out we're married too. That's... that's a part of it.
He was so vulnerable. So scared.
I... I had to tell him that it was just for the insurance.
Norma.
I know. I know it's stupid, but I just couldn't tell him in the moment.
I j... I was afraid that it would undo all of the progress that he's done, so I will tell him... soon. Okay? But just not right away.
I've screwed everything up.
No, no.
Yeah, I have.
You brought me a big, beautiful TV. I've just screwed it up.
No, no. No, you haven't.
You did what you thought was the right thing, okay?
You're a mother. I'm not. I've never been a parent.
We're gonna get through this. Okay?
And I'm going to help you. And I'm going to help Norman.
He's never had a decent father figure in his life.
He just... he needs to adjust.
Okay? You did the right thing.
He's your son. I'm not trying to get in the way of that.
Really?
Yes.
All right? We'll handle this.
I love you.
You ready, Norman?
I am.
Come on.
Welcome home, Norman.
Thank you, Mother.
