I'm her uncle. She's...
So, who was that chick who got dropped off at your house two nights ago?
She's my niece. Jackie.
We have a serious f*cking Lori problem.
Will Jack's niece be joining us?
Jack's niece?
What is her name again?
Oh, uh, Izzy?
Izzy.
Jack told Ava that her name was Jackie.
Hey, Iz.
Yeah.
Everything all right?
You think she's gonna come?
Are you absolutely sure that we've never met?
: What the hell's in those woods?
My aunt and my uncle.
Ow! f*ck!
[pounds on door]
sh1t, she's here.
: We both know something weird is going on with them and the niece that fell from the sky.
She's in there.
: I've been going out of my mind thinking about a married couple getting it on without me.
I'm jealous when you're with Andy.
I'm a jealous when you're with Jack.
You are?
Me too.
I'm gonna ask you to tell me exactly where you dropped her off.
Has anyone in this room ever had a threesome?
[woman moaning]
It's so porn-y.
That's often the case with p0rn... which is what happens when you Google "threesome."
Do guys actually want girls to sit full weight on their face like that?
I just... I thought that was a figure of speech.
How can he breathe?
It's not like he can see the chicks making out or anything.
His face is... is... is totally covered.
I think that's the point.
Oh, my God.
I never knew p0rn could be this sad and funny at the same time.
Hmm. You know what?
Why don't we try to find some tips?
You know, like, 
Been doing some research?
Well, I did some for... for me and Emma.
Ooh, here's a blog...
"Six Easy Steps to Your First Threesome."
Here we go.
"Number one: Don't overthink or overprepare.
There's no right or wrong. Just dive in."
Doesn't that void two through six?
It does. It does.
So we should just...
Whoo!
Okay, let's get this party started.
No, don't do that.
We're gonna raise the roof in the bedroom!
Em, Em, don't do that.
What? Was that a joke, or are we...
You were being serious?
Yes, that was for real.
You don't need to... You don't need to...
What? Okay.
Thanks.
But this thing... What's... What's...
That's turning me on. What's that?
Ah, this is her pout.
She does this when she wants to get her way.
See? Look at this. [Laughs]
That's the one. You just want to have s*x with it.
I do. I do!
Okay, guys, I'm all pouted out.
It's not...
So, should we take a shower?
I don't know what's...
Mm, I do love showers.
And I... And I do love s*x, but maybe we should just keep those two things separate for tonight.
S... so, what do we do?
Eeee-uh...
Kiss me.
Oh.
Me?
Yeah.
Do you want us...
[chuckles]
Well, here we go.

She's got some sh1t going on. That's okay.
I don't need simple and easy.
Simple and easy's boring, right?
You know what I think?
If you really care about her, I don't think you should be following her around like this.
I think you two should sit down, have a little tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, which is French.
It means "head-to-head."
I don't know if that's an osmosis thing or if it's just a symbol of, "I'm willing to put myself this close to you to get to know you, to get to know what's in your brains."
You need to talk to her like that.

Ava! Lori! Are you okay?
Everything's fine, Paul.
Well, it's Andy here lost his girlfriend.
Think she might be inside maybe? Is that what you thought?

You can...

What? Honey, what is it? What?
Ow, ow, ow!
What's your problem?
Migraine. Comes and goes.
I'm good.
Oh.
So Jack's niece, Izzy, is here, and you now...
What again? You came to pick her up?
So did you consider just ringing the doorbell?
Yeah, well, I, uh...
Hey, here's an idea.
Andy goes home and promises to use the front door from now on.
Oh, I do, yeah.
I really do.
Great.
Then the rest of us can take our collective nose out of Jack and Emma's business.
How's that sound, Lori?
Oh.
She came through the woods!
If this Izzy was Jack's niece, why would she need to skulk through the woods?
Huh, Dave?
Uh, yeah, Dave, you got to admit it's kind of vexing.
I totally agree.
Andy, really?
Because I think the cops would be a lot more vexed by you sneaking around, peering into people's windows.
Don't you?
That's a strong point.
I'm gonna go home now.
It's a good choice.
Uh, Mom.
Mom, oh, my God.
Oh! Oh, Lord.
Oh.
Stop it. That's weird.
No, no. It's good.
It's, like, pleasant. We should all do it.
Oh.
What are they doing?

So, that raises some questions.
So, Em, that's Andy in the expanding mob of neighbors.
God damn it, he's cute.
What's he doing here?
No idea.
This is f*cking bad.
Okay? Let's just, uh...
Let's stop on 3. This is weird.
Okay, ready? One, two, three, stop.
I warned her.
That, uh, was disturbing.
I thought you were leaving.
What are you doing?
Think I'm gonna hang around.
See how this plays out.
Yeah?
Right on. Very cool.
f*ck!
f*cking Lori! God damn it!
What's Andy doing here?
Ah, f*cking Lori!
f*cking Lori!
God, I knew it.
I knew it. I knew it.
Like, I knew it.
I knew she would be the one to take me down with her f*cking face!
Honey, honey, honey.
You're doing that comic-book thing, okay?
Guys.
Just breathe.
I'm breathing.
Guys.
They're waiting for an appearance from us.
Like, uh, what are we gonna do?
All right. Come on, people!
Let's, uh, head out. Nothin' to see here.
That's a matter of opinion. Am I right?
Okay, let's, uh, disband this meeting of the neighborhood watch, shall we?
Let's all go home to our homes. Separate homes.
Okay, you are not the boss of me.
If you want to go home, then, by all means, go home.
But I have a job to do.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
I am protecting the integrity of the Hamilton School because there is something kinky going on inside that house.
Kinky. How do you even...
You just jump straight to kinky just because Jack, his wife, and their niece are in the bedroom together with moody lighting and...
Whoa, honey.
... and sexy music?
Hey. Hey, honey.
Honey. We got it.
That is crazy talk, Lori, and out of line, okay?
I'm not gonna be dean.
I'm not gonna be dean!
I can't believe I'm not gonna be dean.
I can't believe this is happening.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do, people, okay?
Okay.
We're gonna lie.
Hmm?
Is that it?
Is there more?
That's it.
We are gonna go out there, and we're gonna lie.
And we're gonna lie. And we're gonna lie some more.
We are gonna say that Izzy is our goddamn f*ckin' niece, and that's that!
Okay, honey, that's...
No, no, no, no.
Lori calls me out, I am gonna hurt her.
No, she has no business...
No, no, no.
She is the...
No, no, no. Shh!
You need to calm down, okay?
First it was me. Now it's you. Okay?
We got to both just get our bearings.
I'm sorry.
Sorry. I'm just, like, spinning.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I love you very much, okay?
I love you, too.
Okay. So we're gonna...

We're gonna do this together, though, okay?
We're gonna come up at with a solution. Okay?

I'm not gonna cry.
No. We're good.
We're good, okay?
I love you.
Okay? It's okay.
You okay now?
I love you very much.
I love you.
I'm sorry, guys.
f*ck! This is all my fault.
Izzy.
Oh, God.
I really feel like, at this point, our only option is just to walk up there on the porch.
We'll walk right in the door, or does anyone have a key?
Carmen? Dave?
Hey, hey! Wow!
Hi, every... Why are you...
What's happening? Why are you guys here?
Well, see, this young man, he was lurking around the side of your house, peeking in your windows.
Said he was looking for his girlfriend.
Hey, once again, I didn't use the word "girlfriend."
Yes, he did.
Andy, why... why are you... Why'd you follow me here to... to my uncle's house?
[sarcastically] Right.
Uncle Jack.
I know you said you weren't feeling well, which, you know, wasn't entirely surprising considering the pizza intake.
You weren't dressed in the window.
He wasn't dressed.
Mnh-mnh.
Yes, I was. I had my...
What?
It was...
You're sure it wasn't the reflection in the...
No.
[laughs]
Saw your...
My one nip? This nipple?
It's a great shirt.
I've never even seen this guy before.
You never even talked about him, and, like, all of a sudden, you get a text, you say you're sick, and then you sneak off to his house?
Like, what's going on?
You know, conversely, none of us had ever heard of nor seen her before, what, uh, three days ago?
Three days ago.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
You know what, Lori?
Maybe... Maybe they did drift apart.
Maybe there are some complex family dynamics that we simply don't feel obligated to share with you.
Okay, riddle me this, Trakarskys.
If she is your niece, why does she have to sneak through the woods to go and visit her own family?
Hmm?
Yeah.
Yeah. Good one, Lori.
I was actually wondering the exact same thing.
Happy Halloween!
Boom.
When I was like...
Four...
... 14.
14.
Jack scared the sh1t out of me...
Like...
... and my friends wearing this, so...
Same mask.
I snuck her in.
She hid in the closet with this.
It was...
It was epic.
Yep.
Jack peed his pants.
[laughs]
What?
I didn't pee my pants.
It was like, uh, I spilled something on...
Jack, you pissed your pants?
That is f*cking awesome!
I didn't pee my pants.
It's part of the lore.
Don't fight it, honey.
Why was that necessary?
It's happening.
Okay, so, that's it. We can wrap this up.
Or do you guys want to go home and get your, uh, torches and pitchforks?
What? No, no.
I was being a good neighbor! I mean, if... if one of you sees a stranger peering in my window, I would hope you would have the decency to say, "Hey, Lori. You need to know there's a creepy man lookin' in your window," and not just sit there and laugh at me.
It's... It's all good, Lori.
I mean, this is gonna make a great story for everyone.
You know who would really enjoy this particular anecdote?
Uh, Lisa Sangster.
Wait. Isn't she on the Hamilton Alumni Board with you?
She's the chairperson, yeah.
Um, you're friends?
Since college.
So, it's super-late.
Mom.
Let's go.
