Will you marry me?
Yes.
I'm pregnant.
So?
It's Hakeem's.
You know, a lot of women, they don't survive childbirth.
Cookie, this is Harper Scott.
Harper Scott.
You're falling for him again.

They did it. They voted me out.
I don't want to do it.
Oh, come on, why not?
Why not, baby?

: 
Make sure you vote for a Lyon.
Any one, doesn't matter.
You look beautiful. Nice group of people.
: It's not enough to be nominated. I do want to win.
It's been a crazy year for my family and there's been some doubters.
I feel like to win would be a big up to my fans.
Talking about the people who doubted you, you seemed like you were poised for a ASA sweep till your father's video hit.
That dude's comin' to take you out.
Nah, man, maybe so, but, uh, it's-it's not a boxing match.
Well, maybe someone should tell him that.
Well, maybe someone should tell the press to leave us alone with the negative...
Uh, you know what, you know what?
I promise you this, whatever those rumors you're hearing about my family, they're just that, baby, media lies.
See, 'cause the Lyons, baby, we are closer, we are tighter than...
The Manson Family.
Don't listen to this bitch, She don't know what she's talking about.
Besides, we're more like the black Partridge Family, you know?
(laughs)
I do know what I'm talking about.
Stop moping, boy.
Lucious is doing exactly what a big superstar does.
And if you want to be bigger than him, like you say you do...
I will be bigger than him, and I'm gonna win.
But it's like this is just stupid, and he's so damn thirsty, Ma, just coming with...
Stop it.
Now, Empire has a lot riding on these ASAs, Jamal.
We need to get that board to officially reinstate Lucious, or I don't know who the hell is going to run my company.
So is this a best-man-win situation or a me-help-him situation?
It's neither one, dummy.
All right, Ma.
Make sure that you don't get caught up in him again.
(sighs)
It's pretty rare for a man with your rep, from your culture, to admit to having suffered from childhood abuse.
Well, one of the wonderful things that I learned in making this video, is the fact that... the people with real courage are those who have suffered with mental illness.
Oh, really? Well, I don't think you realize there are more people in this room.
Like ASA voters.
Come on.
I will see you soon.
Ten minutes... I'm sorry.
Yes.
Keep rolling.
Hey, you're gonna have to get your emotions in check.
Harper happens to have the hottest blog in the music business, and if she could put me on the cover, man, that-that raises my odds.
Watch it.
It is disrespectful of you and quite childish for you to try and put this on my emotions.
What you're about to do is ruin the truce you got going with Jamal.
What? If he can't handle the heat...
Uh... the boy should get out the kitchen.
You get out the kitchen, son, I got the better song.
Which one?
My song, "Heavy."
Okay, hey, hey, y'all, hey.
Which one? Thank you.
Now that you're all liquored up, I know y'all have some questions for the first family of music, so shoot.
Now, I know he said it's not a boxing match, but Jamal was the favorite on every list, so, I mean, isn't this kind of like Balboa-Creed?
Wait, wait. First and foremost, um, me and my son are not the only people up for this award, but if this was a boxing match, it would be more like Foreman in his prime versus De La Hoya.
I'm just saying, I'm ready to play, you ready to play?
I was born to play.
Let's play.
Oh, here come your goon in his tacky suit.
Hey, Cookie.
Hey.
Always a pleasure.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, Luc, can we, uh, chop it up in private?
Anything you need to say to me, you can say around Skeletor.
All them bones I done buried.
Okeydokey.
Well, Lucious, as you officially don't know, I have not been spying on our board members.
But if I was, I would tell you that a few members are pushing real hard to bring in a new CEO.
Uh-uh.
An outsider to run my company?
Mmm, our company.
Well, that ain't gonna happen.
I don't know how many of these white folks I'm gonna have to...
Ah, Lucious, uh-uh.
Not after two dead lesbos and a strangled cat.
I mean, listen to her, she's right.
I mean, as much as it would bring me joy, it's not the right time for that.
No.
No.
We got the shareholders right where we want them, we just got to push.
The way I see it, we got all these cameras on us right now.
: Mm-hmm.
Because of these ASAs.
If they see my family's united behind me, then it's the next logical step for the board to reinstate me, right?
Well, yeah, I'm having a little flashback...
I think we tried that a couple times, all right?
I mean, I don't want to be that guy, but do you really believe you can get your three sons to rally behind Don Dada here?
I mean, what's the odds?
Well, they all need a whole lot of hand-holding.
Hey.
Are you trying to save your company, or are you trying to catch an STD?
Morning, Ma. Sorry I kept you waiting.
Hmm, it's okay baby.
I've been working the phones all morning.
The board wants to offer Brigham Lang the CEO job.
He knows how to run family brands.
No. Uh-uh, Andre.
We cannot go through that again.
So let me guess.
The family needs to present a united front, and you want me to talk to my brothers and pretend it's not coming from you, right?
Exactly. Especially to Jamal.
He thinks I'm sprung on Lucious.
Are you?
Never mind, doesn't matter.
If you ask Jamal, he'll think you're letting Lucious manipulate you.
Exactly.
I'll make it happen.
And I'll put something together.
Really big. I mean, a blowout.
They're seeing all of us up there.
We'll remind that board what they get when the Lyons run the Empire.
I have an idea that could make the event even bigger.
Hmm?
Tie in a fund-raiser with the National Alliance for Bipolar Disorder.
And make me the spokesperson.
You mean, like, you, uh, going public about your...
I think it's time.
It's a good cause, and it would really show the board family values.
That's brilliant, Dre.
Yeah, going public about his bipolar son.
That makes your father even more of a hero for doing that video.
Lucious will love it.
And the board will love him.
I'll tell him it's all your idea.
: 
 but my family didn't believe in me.
: Yeah, but with all this ass here, though, why are you worried?

Did she actually say it's over?
She slapped me at the strip club.

Bro, if you're trying to lecture me right now, don't.

Seriously.

I guess in your own ass-backwards way, you had a sort of impressive run.
Mm-hmm.
That's true, man, you was a wild CEO, but you were making moves.
Yeah, a mash-up between DMX and Bill Gates.
(laughter)
Mom needs us, guys.
All right, ASAs are important to her, and that's enough to make me want to help.
Dre, this is weird to me, though.
You, of all people, doing a bipolar event for Lucious.
It's not for him, it's for Mom.
I'm starting to feel like that's the same thing these days.
Wait, are you saying Mom is falling for Lucious?
Hell no.
I ain't getting King Kong and Godzilla back together.
Look at it like this, Hakeem, if you think that you deserve a shot at getting Laura back, shouldn't, shouldn't Lucious get a shot at getting Cookie back?
And Jamal, you know, you-you wanted an ASA since you were in diapers.
You gonna let Lucious knock you off your game?
Whatever, Dre.
You know there was a time when Dad would have called you a sissy, and you would have gone running and crying to Aunt Carol.
I don't think that's who you are anymore.

Hi. Come on in.
Welcome to baby wonderland.
Yeah.
Look, I hired the bossest baby proofers.
No edges, no corners, no sockets.
It's like a baby wonderland now.
I even got something for the nursery.
(growls)
(sighs) What are you doing, Hakeem?
I'm the father.
I know it's more than buying stuff, but it's to show you that I'm in.
What about your fiancée?
What about her?
I love her. She loves me.
And I know she'll love the baby, too.
But before I step to her, I got to make sure we straight first.
(sighs) Well, what makes you think that I want you involved in raising our child?
Anika, the one good thing about being a Lyon... other than being kicked up to the fullest... is that I've seen every wrong move in raising a family, and I know what I shouldn't do.
But there's a problem.
Your father threatened my life the day the baby is born.
What?
So forgive me, if I'm not feeling the whole concept of being a Lyon.
: 
 with fresh raspberries.
Enjoy.
Thank you.
Well, seriously, your-your staff was telling me that this series I'm doing on you keeps getting bigger.
Well, if you move me to your front page, maybe I'll give you an exclusive.
You'd make it exclusive for me, Lucious?
Exclusively yours.
Hmm.
Okay, well, I guess we'll have to go front page.
Mmm, my God.
This woman has a tracking device in your sack or something.
This woman got a lot of things, honey.
Ooh, it smell fishy in here.
We were eating lobster for lunch.
Mmm, I'm sure.
I'm free tonight.
How about I have my dessert later?
(chuckles) I'll send the car.
All right.
You might want to send some vinegar and water.
I'll see you tonight, Lucious.
Why you got to be so nasty?
: You the one nasty.
You need to disinfect this seat.
(laughs)
What?
Your boy got something really important to say to you, Lucious.
So you threatened to kill her.
The mother of my child?
I don't know what you're talking about.
The last I heard, you didn't care what happened to her.
Her mom's telling her to leave New York and to get as far away from me as possible.
Oh, well, she can't do that, Hakeem.
You have rights as a father, and we have lawyers.
Hell, Thirsty's shady ass can get that baby.
Mom, stop.
I'm the father.
The baby's mine, okay?
I want Anika to feel safe and happy.
So here's the deal: If Anika leaves, you won't see the baby or me again.
Uh, Hakeem.
Hakeem.
Ooh, he's upset.
(chuckles) You think it's funny, don't you?
You know we need the boy to show up to our event.
Or, you can get used to answering to whitey.
You know I'm sick and tired of the way they do business.
I know, so maybe you should back off, and let me handle Boo Boo Kitty.
You worry about that-that scallop you have coming to see you later.
(sighs)
I should have never went public.
: 
 wasn't an easy thing for me.
In fact, it was terrifying.
And that's exactly why I'm doing it.
Mental health is such a shameful subject, especially for African-American families.
For years, my father hid from that shame, because the thought of his own mother being bipolar was more than he could bear.
I feel like maybe Lucious should actually say that second part, you know?
"I hid from the shame," therefore, it's more of a back and forth between father and son, you know?
Got you.
That's why you're here, baby.
(laughter)
If this gets him reinstated as CEO, you know what that means, right?
Yes.
With Jamal and Hakeem out of the running, that leaves you solidly in place for his number two.
Mmm, just a heartbeat away from the throne, baby.
Where you always belonged.
Yeah, that's right.
And what about those other two board members, the holdouts?
Oh, they'll be there.
I made sure of that.
Okay, good.
Cookie's arranged for a ton of press.
Everything's in position.
Okay?
(distant shouting, horn honking)
Anika?
Uh, Anika, we need to talk about what you're doing with your baby. (Gasps)
Oh, no. What happened?
Step aside, ma'am.
Wait, is she okay?
Ma'am, you need to step aside.
You need to stop telling me what to do.
Is she gonna be all right?
Hold up. Is she okay?
(groans)
Look, ma'am, you can follow us to the hospital.
I'm not following.
I'm riding. That's my son's baby.

Bleeding is dark red, approximately 100-150 cc's.
No visible wounds. BP is 104/66.
Pulse, 140 beats per minute.

Oh, my God, it hurts so bad.
Ma'am, I need you to stay calm.
Can you tell me how bad the pain is?
She's having a damn panic attack.
Can't you give her something?
I can give her oxygen, that's it.
Pain meds might effect the baby.
No, I'm not...
Anika, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Anika, listen.
Listen, listen.
Anika, I need you to relax, okay?
You're stressing the baby.
I can't.
Look, uh, I know you're scared.
I need you to trust me right now, okay?
Forget everything. Forget everything.
And just listen to the sound of my voice.
Breathe.
Breathe with me.
Like this: (breathing steadily)
Come on.
There you go.
Come on, keep going.
Okay, let him put that on.
Keep breathing.

That's my little grandchild in there.

Oh, so now you the moral compass.

You understand it's about family first, then it's kingdom.
That's the thing, the family stuff is a little messed up right now. Let me guess, she's really not feeling this whole addition to the nuclear family, huh?
I bet you if you and I talked to her together, she would see things a whole different way.
All right, I'm gonna go check on Anika.

Something that could go online as early as tomorrow morning?
That would be a really good look.
Are you really talking about scooping Harper?
I mean, you got a problem with that?
I don't owe her anything, and she ain't got nothing on me.
: I mean, the truth is, I wanted to put a human face to mental illness.
That's what "Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom" was all about for me, you know?
You're gonna win that ASA, Lucious.
And that'll be great for Empire's share price.
I'm sorry for being so bottom line about it.
Uh-Uh, no, you can't apologize for that.
I mean, that's the difference between me and my other son, Jamal.
I'm an artist, but I actually care about our shareholders.
Now, I'm not saying that he is any less deserving of an ASA just because me and his mama picked all his songs for his album.
No, he's just, uh, an artist that's still developing, which is a good thing.
A really good thing.
Nice.
Jamal, we were just talking about you.
So this is what we're gonna do, Dad?
For an award?
I came here to support you and Dre.
Relax, man, I'm just doing a little business here.
I don't like the way that you do business.
It's not right.
Jamal.
No, it's cool.
I wouldn't perform here if you paid me.
I'm out.
Jamal.
You b*st*rd.
Letting another publication scoop me?
And you knew that that would make my big Lucious Lyon exclusive useless.
I didn't know anything, sweetheart, but...
(chuckles) I like to share my stories.
Mm-hmm.
I'll see you later.
No love?
Andre, just the man I was looking for.
I have something I think that might interest you.
Um, it's not really a good time.
I'm about to go on stage with my father.
What is this?
It's a group home outside of Philadelphia.
This couple collects money from the state to take care of ten mentally ill adults.
Keep going.
That's woman's name is Leah Walker.
I believe she's your grandmother.
You can keep the pictures.
Hey.
What's going on? You okay?
Um...
I have to go.
Go?
Go where, babe?
: Hi.
Laura, what are you doing here?
Your dad called me.
He said he had Anika moved to a nicer room, and that you're really taking care of her.
He said you're becoming a man he respects.
My dad said that?
Is she gonna be okay?
Yeah, she's doing better.
They say she should be able to leave tomorrow.
I've been carrying this ring ever since you took it off.
I was hoping maybe you could see things the way I see them.
(indistinct conversation)
(crowd cheering)
Freda, whatcha doing here?
What up?
Whatcha do... Whatcha doing here?
I seen your poster on Hakeem's app, thought I'd come through.
That's so dope, come on. Yeah, yeah, come on.
What's up, y'all? How y'all doin'?
That is so dope, you came through?
Yeah, man, had to, man.
(chuckles)
Amen. That's-that's right.
You see, Empire is a family brand.
And together, we're taking that brand into the future.
Together, we've faced many obstacles, and overcome many challenges, that's made us stronger than ever.
Yes.
Where are your sons tonight?
This doesn't really seem like much of a family.
: Uh, you want to hear about family?
Well, I will tell you about family.
Ladies and gentleman, I have an amazing announcement for you tonight.
For the first time ever, the Lyon family will be performing at this year's ASA awards.
The Empire presents the first family of music.
Hakeem, Jamal, and Lucious Lyon, all on the same stage at the same damn time.
How about that?
Ain't that something?
Yes.
Is that really gonna happen?
Yes, even if I have to get a strap and strangle you all to behave.
: 
 but we've got him.
Ladies and gentleman, let's give a warm round of applause for Jamal Lyon.
(applause and cheering)
: Get 'em, Mal!
Okay, Mal!
That's right, Jamal!

Congratulations, you two.
We just heard you've raised a record amount of money tonight for NABD.
And, Cookie, that vision you laid out of the Lyon family presenting and performing at the ASAs... Oh, genius.
Thank you. It's just what we need to reposition Empire and get Wall Street re-excited about the company.
Yes.
Well, that's exactly why we did it.
You know, Lucious, the board had been looking at an outside candidate for CEO, but we're now unanimous in our thinking that it should be...
Well, before you go any further, I just want to say, without the help of Cookie Lyon, my number one, this would not have been possible.
That's just what we were getting to.
Considering the fact the two of you co-founded Empire and now continue to work together so well, the board would like you to come on as co-CEOs.
Co-CEO? (Laughs)
Control of Empire would be split down the middle, between the two of you.
Uh, that-that-that-that's a great proposition, but I think, um, Lucious and I, we would have to discuss the details.
Nah, no, no, there's nothing to discuss.
Um...
Um...
I think it's a fantastic idea.
I'm so glad to hear you say that.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
That's wonderful.
Take care.
Congratulations.
Take care.
You do?
I mean, you and me finally working together, side by side.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Congratulations, baby.
Thank you.
(laughs)
(laughs)
I got your back.
