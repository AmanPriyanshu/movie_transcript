Previously on Faking It...
Did you set me up?
I thought I'd psyche you out a little.
Maybe we just try being friends.
Yeah, let's... Let's give that a shot.
We have a thing, don't we?
Well, no, we can't have a thing, not now.
I can earn your trust back.
To do that, I think I should move out.
I'll let you crash on my couch.
Amy?
Look, Karma, it's Sabrina!
Don't forget bunk five!
We were The Three Amigas.
OMG, we ruled.
Look at us now, back together and better than ever!
Maybe there is hope for One Direction.
How lucky are we that her dad transferred here?
So, so, so lucky.
You guys, stop.
I'm the lucky one.
Aww.
Seriously, what's the drug scene like here?
I've been dying to try bath salts.
You guys in?
Karma, she's kidding!
Sabrina, I forgot all about your great sense of humor.
Well, as fun as this trip down memory lane has been, I have to go, 'cause Shane and I are holding auditions for our band.
'Cause I'm in a band.
Good for you, Karm, living out your Taylor Swift dreams.
Amy and I will spend time catching up.
I guess I can be a little late.
Karma, no, don't worry.
Sabrina lives here now, so you will have plenty of one-on-one time with her too.
That's exactly what I wanted!
Ugh!
Here, let me.
I almost had it.
Yeah, I know, but I'm happy to help, since I'm here.
Speaking of which, how much longer can I stay?
'Cause I can be even more helpful if you like.
I'm not having s*x with you.
What?
No, no, no, I was not suggesting that.
I just...
I dig it here.
You do?
Yeah, what's not to like?
800 count sheets, potpourri in the bathroom.
Citrus Cilantro.
It's my personal blend.
Also, my next option is sleeping in my car.
And we all know how filthy that back seat must be.
Fine, you can stay.
Just don't piss me off.
Yeah, got it.
Don't worry, I got all the rules down.
Lights out by 10:00, no shoes indoors, toilet seat down, label all my food...
You make it sound like I'm your warden.
Not at all.
I love rules!
Shane's house was a free-for-all, nonstop fun and games.
Are you saying I'm not fun?
Different people have different definitions of fun.
For me, my fun is helping out around here.
Don't forget that.
Okay, I'm gonna go to school.
Do you want to walk together?
No?
Okay, then.
(MANDOLIN STRUMMING)
Okay, Cindy, thanks.
We'll be in touch.
I await with bated breath.
That's the third person you've cut off.
You know this is Hester, not the school from "Fame," right?
Well, none of these people are right.
And?
And I'm in a hurry.
Because?
Because I'm nervous about leaving Amy alone with that phony, two-faced Sabrina!
I thought you guys were The Three Amigas.
Oh no, señor.
Sabrina is no amiga of mine.
Hey guys, look, a blue jay!
No way! Where?
Ow!
Oops.
Sorry, Karm.
Nighty night, Karm.
I had to do something, so each night, I'd sneak into their bunk, until someone tipped off night duty.
Let me guess.
You think it was Sabrina.
Well, after that, she had Amy to herself every night.
Karma, I know that 12-year-old you thinks Sabrina was out to get you, but don't you think it's possible you were just jealous Amy had a new friend?
Okay, I know sometimes I can be a little possessive of Amy, but that's not what is happening here.
Sabrina is not who she portrays herself to be.
She is bad news.
Karma, even if your memories of Sabrina are correct...
Which they are.
Uh-huh.
Are you the same person you were then?
No.
Well, maybe Sabrina isn't either.
You're right.
I should give her a second chance.
Way to take my advice.
Okay, next!
You guys are the Double Puntendres?
I thought you were Zhe and Zhim.
We're just workshopping names.
Um, you're here to audition?
I am.
Apparently paying gigs want bands, so I need to be in one.
Pity!
Unfortunately, we're looking for a guitar player and not a manipulative backstabber.
Best of luck, though!
Will you excuse us for a second?
I know what you're gonna say, and I don't care that Noah's incredibly talented and has great eyebrows.
He betrayed me, and people like that never change.
But we just agreed that Sabrina and I both changed.
This is different.
Never gonna happen.
Bye.
Remember when Jessica F lost her canoe paddle and drifted into the lake?
Do I!
They found her, right?
I'm pretty sure.
Hey, pop quiz in Sacred Sites.
Study that Shinto shrine.
Oh, thanks for the heads up, Felix.
Oh, by the way, meet Sabrina.
She just moved here, and she's the best.
I'm sorry to see you've fallen in with a such a bad crowd so soon.
She does seem pretty sketchy, but I'll take my chances.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Why did you let me blah blah blah about Jessica F when we could have been talking about Felix?
He is super cute.
Are you guys dating?
Long story short, no, not dating.
Oh, is there another guy in the picture?
Nope, no guy, or girl, for that matter.
Oh!
You always talked about boys at camp, so I just assumed.
Man, that was Republican of me.
No, it's been a rather recent development.
How about you?
I have a boyfriend.
We're trying the long-distance thing.
What can I say?
I'm a masochist.
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm back!
And Sabrina, I apologize, but you're gonna have to repeat everything you told Amy, because I need a crash course in all things you.
Man, I don't even know where to start.
I mean, we covered a lot of ground.
Oh, well, hey, why don't we all hang out tonight?
It'll be like old times, only now we're older and wiser and more mature.
Great idea, Karm!
The Three Amigas back in action!
Yes!
What should we do?
I've never robbed a convenience store before.
(LAUGHS)
(CELL PHONES RINGING)
Oh.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
We... we're all seeing this, right?
Come in, have fun, and feel free to leave your shoes on.
Liam will take your coats.
Welcome.
This is a serious game night.
: This is Lauren.
: Jinx!
Hey, so I just wanted to say, thank you for inviting me to this even though you don't know me that well.
Thank you for coming.
A lot of my followers are nerds, so I wanted to show them I accept their kind.
Smile!
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)
So you're living with Lauren?
That's a little weird, right?
No!
I mean, it's surprising, sure, but no, it's not weird at all.
Liam, the door?
Hey.
Hey.
What is he doing here?
Oh, I invited him.
This is Noah.
Hi.
Hi.
Okay, enough with the chitchat.
Let's get to the fun, shall we?
We've got a schedule to keep.
Okay, first of all, let's pick teams.
Oh, I'm so excited we're on the same team.
Yeah.
Oh, me too!
The Three Amigas back en la casa.
Our team is going to crush you guys.
Yeah.
These two are so close, they can practically read each other's minds.
Oh, wait, she's totally right.
They should be split up.
Agreed.
Wait, hold on.
It's Lauren's game night.
Lauren, you decide.
Well, I don't want to be accused of winning unfairly, so Karma, switch with someone from Team Two.
What?
Take Noah!
Sorry, Karma.
Looks like my evil plan to get rid of you worked.
Jeez, I was just kidding.
I love how you fall for that every time.
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, good one, Sabrina.
(UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)
Uh, it's a movie...
She's a hooker.
People say it's a romantic comedy but really least romantic movie in the world.
Oh, "Pretty Woman"!
Yes!
Yes!
A lame duck.
You're yesterday's news.
Someone's trying to replace you.
You think so?
What?
No, I'm talking about your card.
Karma, no peeking.
Oh, that's your first infraction!
(SIGHS)
Karma, one.
Uh, circle!
Circle!
Hula hoop.
The Earth.
Circle!
Round!
"The Lion King."
Circle of Life?
Do something other than point!
Do something.
(TIMER RINGING)
What was it?
A pizza.
Dude...
You couldn't even draw a (BLEEP) pepperoni?
Your art's really gone downhill, huh?
Okay, so Team Two got no points that round, so we keep the lead.
Way to be a disaster, Booker.
Okay, five minute break.
Any longer than that, and we'll lose our momentum.
Hey, guys, so I've been finding cans and bottles in the trash.
Can we please try to remember to recycle?
Okay, what is going on?
You're acting like Lauren's little bitch.
No, I'm not.
I don't know you that well, but he's right.
I'm her houseguest, Felix.
I'm trying not to piss her off.
No, what you are is New Lisbeth.
No, I am not.
If I were New Lisbeth, would I be helping Lauren hold New Lisbeth auditions next week?
Yes.
That's exactly what New Lisbeth would do.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
♪
Hey, I feel like I haven't seen you in forever.
It's been, like, an hour.
Yeah, but still.
I mean, it sucks that they split us up.
Yeah, but they were right that it wasn't fair of us to be on the same team together.
We would have kicked their asses.
We're totally unbeatable!
We are, aren't we?
Peace offering?
We got off on the wrong foot, Shane.
I want to apologize.
You can try.
I needed that prize money, and I manipulated you to get it.
Whether or not you want me in the band, I'm just glad I get the chance to tell you how truly sorry I am.
That's a...
That's a good apology.
It's one of my many talents.
Okay, enough groveling.
I've given it some thought, and I forgive you.
You're in the band.
Wow, that's great.
But I've also given it some thought, and I don't think your band is the right fit for me.
Thanks for the offer, though.
(TIMER RINGING)
Okay, okay.
Back on the clock, everyone.
Uh-oh, we got a spy from Team Two.
But the game hasn't even started yet.
Yeah, good catch!
Karma, another infraction.
Yeesh, again?
Man, Lauren really has it out for you.
Yeah, it's starting to seem that way.
You guys saw that, right?
Your second infraction, yep.
Yeah, we already have one person playing for the other team.
We don't need two.
Maybe you guys didn't notice it, but I'm pretty sure Sabrina is using Lauren's game night to bring me down.
Is she serious?
Sadly, yes.
Sabrina seems cool.
Me and her are thinking about starting a graphic novel book club.
Wow, I would like to join that.
Yeah?
Yeah, totally.
Sabrina, it's your turn!
Get it, girl!
Whoo!
Yes!
All right.
Ow!
(IMITATING LIGHT SABER)
Uh, uh, vibrator!
Uh...
"Star Wars."
Yep!
I got six points.
That means Team Two is coming back.
Whoo-hoo!
Except, well, I'm sorry to say, but you made light saber noises, and like, the only rule of charades is no noise.
I didn't make noise, did I?
I didn't hear anything.
Who cares?
Yeah, you did.
That counts as your third infraction, which means you're disqualified.
Disqualified? From game night?
I'm Team Let's End Game Night.
Sorry, Karm.
Didn't mean to make this, like, a thing.
You never do, do you, Sabs?
I mean, this is just like camp all over again.
Camp? I'm sorry Karma.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Of course you don't.
Karma, why are you flipping out?
I'm flipping out because Sabrina has been out to get me all night.
Why can't any of you see that?
We need to talk now.
It's okay, we can keep going without them.
Liam, go get the Twister mat.
No.
I'm not gonna get the Twister mat, because I think it's unfair that you disqualified Karma.
Oh, please.
Don't let your pen1s make game decisions for you.
Ooh!
Burn.
You know what?
That's it. I'm moving out.
I don't want to be here if it means being your slave.
Or as you call it, Lisbeth.
You said helping is fun for you.
Yeah, because I didn't want to piss you off.
The same reason I've been letting you win.
I don't need anyone to let me win.
Prove it.
This time we'll play you against me.
No holding back.
Fine!
Game on, Booker.
Game on.
How could you do that?
Sabrina just moved here, and she's trying to fit in.
This is exactly what she wants, to turn us against each other.
Look, behind your back, Sabrina is a totally different person.
She hates me, and she wants you all to herself.
That's ridiculous!
And why am I only hearing about this now?
Because I was 12 and insecure, and I was worried you were gonna believe her over me, which is exactly what is happening here.
Okay, Karma, I love you, but do you realize how crazy jealous you sound?
Sabrina is not some evil mastermind.
She's just a person.
Who wants to take you away from me.
And maybe I'm a little jealous.
Do you really think that after everything that we've been through, anybody could come between us?
Honestly?
Yeah.
We were broken, Amy, and then my dad had his heart attack, and we were just back.
What if we didn't fix anything?
Look, your dad's heart attack wasn't just some Band-Aid.
It showed us that no matter what happens between us, we will always be there for each other.
Nothing and nobody can come between us, including Sabrina.
You're right.
Thanks for the reminder.
But I do like her, and I really want to be her friend, so you need to make nice.
I can do that.
Okay.
I know your game, buddy.
I'm sorry?
Yeah, I'm supposed to ask why you don't want to be in my band, and then you tell me everything wrong, and then I beg you to help me fix it, right?
So, go ahead.
Why don't you want to be in my band?
Well, man, I really wasn't prepared for this, but since you asked, I guess I'd say, well, I hate the name.
And if I'm being honest, your sound is a little cliché and derivative.
Oh, you want to hear something cliché and derivative?
Go (BLEEP) yourself!
Hey, Sabrina.
Uh, I wanted to apologize.
I thought I'd moved on, but being with you brought up some old memories from camp.
You know, when you bullied me behind Amy's back.
But that was a million years ago, and I forgive you, so I hope we can be friends, for real this time.
I bullied you?
Do you know what that summer was like for me?
You.
Nights in bunk five were the only time I had Amy to myself.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
(SCREAMS)
Ow!
I knew it was you!
I had to peel potatoes for a month!
And I bet you're gonna tell Amy, try to turn her against me?
No.
I'm not 12 anymore, Sabrina.
I can handle Amy having another friend, because I know no one will ever have the connection we do.
You're right.
I'll never connect with Amy the same way you do.
But that doesn't mean you two can't be friends.
So why don't you and I call a truce, for Amy's sake?
Truce.
I'm pretty sure "go (BLEEP) yourself" means we're done talking.
Listen, I want to apologize for real this time.
I was just messing with you.
I don't think you or your band are cliché and derivative at all.
You're great.
Then why do you keep messing with me?
Because sometimes when I like someone, my attempts at flirting can come off as, well, being a dick.
Wait, you like me?
You really need to work on your signals.
How does this read to you?
Wait, so are you in the band or not?
I may need more convincing.
Three eights.
Full house.
Ugh!
All right, all right.
Looks like I'll be sleeping in my car tonight, but the important thing is that we all know that I am not New Lisbeth.
(GROANS)
Wait. Stop.
You don't have to leave.
Maybe I should, 'cause I'm pretty sure I'm gonna piss you off again soon.
I'm pretty sure you will, but I won't kick you out because of it, because it's not horrible having you around.
Don't make a (BLEEP) thing out of it.
(LAUGHS)
Okay, if you insist.
But you should know that tonight was fun.
Sorry tonight was crazy.
I'm cool with crazy.
But there is something that I wanted to talk to you about, if that's okay with you.
You can talk to me about anything.
Earlier when you said that you liked girls, it hit me.
I've been having these dreams lately, and I've always thought that I was straight, but now I'm starting to think that maybe I'm not.
What about your boyfriend?
Made him up.
Typical questioning girl cliché, right?
Wow.
Thank you, for trusting me enough to tell me.
I know how scary it is to open up.
I would appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone while I still try to figure things out.
I know you and Karma tell each other everything.
No, no, I won't tell Karma.
Or anyone.
This is between you and me.
I'm here for you.
I knew you would be.
