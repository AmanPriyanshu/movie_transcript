How many more terrible things are you gonna do to protect me?
That's my job. That's all that matters.
Everything seems to be telling me 
Somebody please help!
There's only one person who can help you now.
The Flash.
Barry, I know you can't give up your speed to that monster.
That's not your decision.
Hand him over and it's yours.
He's becoming human again.

I know some piece of you did care for me.
Please let him go.

I really wish we didn't have to keep Jay's helmet around.
I hate this thing.
Well...
Just want to put a dent in it.
Cisco, did you see Caitlin in your vibe?
[sighs]
Zoom's got her in his lair.
She's scared, but she's okay.
Oh, thank God.
All right, we need to get her back.
I know.
But without your speed, there's no way any of us can get through that breach that Cisco found at the hospital.
I just don't think there's anything we can do right now.
He's right.
And it's thanks to you, Al.
Enough. We're all suffering here.
That's right. That's right, Detective.
We're all suffering. We've lost Snow, you've lost your speed, and now... now Zoom can come through that breach anytime he wants.
And that, Allen... that's on you.
Hey, that's on all of us, okay?
We made these decisions as a team.
No we didn't.
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go find Jesse before Zoom does... again.
Wait, you found her? How?
Cellular dead zones, remote...
People from my Earth vibrate at a different frequency than people from your Earth.
They leave cellular dead zones wherever they go.
That's why I'm always dropping calls around you?
Okay, so... so wait, how did that help?
I track the dead zones created by Jesse since she got here and I follow the trail.
It's easy.
What, so you think you're gonna need that gun to convince her to leave with you?
You're full of questions today, aren't you, West?
The gun is not for my daughter.
She's not the only person from a different Earth, hiding out on this one If I run into them, I'm gonna need this.
Okay, but you're also gonna need some help.
Really?
You know anyone with the speed to help me, Ramon?
Wow.
Great. I'll be in my workshop.
Don't listen to Wells, Barry.
This ain't all on you.
Yeah, I know.
You need a ride back to the station?
No, I'm good.
I'm gonna stick around, actually.
Finished all my cases this morning.
Damn, that was fast.
That was a poor choice of words.
You do know it's okay to ease back into the way you used to do things, right?
Well, this is the only way I can fight crime.

That is an excellent question, Caity.
You know, I've been asking myself the same thing.
But doesn't matter now.
I'm not gonna stick around much longer.
Wait, I thought you said your powers don't work inside this cell?
They don't. You're right.

Listen, honey, there's no way you are making it down that cliff all by yourself.
So let's make a deal.
You get me out of this box, and I'll help you get home.
Might even throw in some wardrobe tips for free.
So what do you say, Caitlin?
Do we have a deal?
I don't understand.
There's nothing around here.
What did the van hit?
I don't know.
Something strong enough to exert an equal amount of force back on the van.
Someone was definitely here, though.
You think maybe a meta-human?
Yeah.
And if it's a meta that's after Wells...
Then they could be from Earth-2.
Probably.

Yup. And who are you?
Name's Griffin Grey.

Nope. But you should.

One of your sins coming home to roost.
All right, you think I...
I'm from...
I'm not... I'm not who you think I am.
I know exactly who you are.
And you're gonna fix what your particle accelerator did to me.
What did the accelerator do to you?
[metal clatters]
That.
Well, that's impressive.
And all things considered, I don't know that having that kind of strength is the worst thing you could have been given.
Yeah, that's what I thought at first.
And it was a lot of fun.
Till I learned it did something else to me, too.
That's me.
Last year.
You're... you're ageing.
If this keeps happening, I'll be dead in a few months.
How old are you, Griffin?
I'm 18.
[sighs] Look.
I'm sorry this is happening to you.
But there's nothing I can do to fix it.
Well, that sucks.
'Cause if you can't figure out a way to help me, Dr. Wells...
You're gonna die soon, too.
I never should have left.
No, this isn't your fault.
Do we know what took him?
That's where things get interesting.
That fingerprint that you guys brought in, the one from the van, I mean.
Yeah, yeah.
Belongs to this guy.
Griffin Grey.
A senior at Central City High School?
No, wait, I've seen this kid's picture before.
He went missing, like, six months ago.
That's right.
That doesn't make any sense.
An 18-year-old didn't kidnap Wells.
That's what I thought at first, but feast your eyes on this.
[computer beeping]
Whoa. It's the same guy.
Yeah, the blood sample confirms it.
How is that even possible?
I'm not sure yet.
Without Caitlin here, I can't really analyze the cells on a molecular level to see what we're dealing with here.
You know, I might actually be able to help.
How?
Bio-chem was one of my majors in college.
One of your majors?
How many did you have?
Five.
What, is that not common here?
Girl, no, that is not common anywhere.
All right, let's search for that Grey, see what we come up with.
I'll see if facial recognition brings him up and I'll have Joe check CCPD's database.
Cool.
See what you can do.
Tick tock, tick tock.
I'm going as fast as I can.
Well, you better go faster.
Zoom will be back any minute.
I could just leave you in there, you know.
Oh.
But you want to go home so badly.
So how did this happen to you?
Woke up one day, cold, pale.
Thought I was sick.
Turns out it was something else entirely.
You got hit by the dark matter from the particle accelerator explosion?
Yes.
Right after I flunked out of med school.
Had to move back in with my mother.
That couldn't have been fun.
If she's anything like mine, I mean.
Why?
Is yours a frigid narcnasist, too?
Cold as ice.
Yeah.
Mom was like that ever since Charlie died.
Who's Charlie?
My brother.
I never had a brother.
No?
Then why was Mom such a bitch on your Earth?
Honestly, I couldn't say.
So... how is this going to get me out of here?
The electrical current in the cable should heat up the carbine, which in turn should speed up the electrons and the faster they go...
The weaker its molecular structure becomes.
Exactly.
I studied every once in a while.
Well, when it gets hot enough, it should make the carbine as fragile as glass.
And then we can both get out of here.
[beeping]

Wally.
Hey, Joe.
What's up?
You look like you got something on your mind.
Yeah, I do.
Please don't tell me you drove all the way over here to ask about The Flash again.

But... it's just one time. That's all I'm asking.
It's impossible.
He saved my life, Joe.
I owe him a thank you.
Look.
I've been reckless my whole life.
Racing cars, pushing limits.
I did everything at full speed without a care in the world.
But it wasn't until Zoom took me that... that I really thought I was gonna die.
And I was going to die, if The Flash didn't do what he did.
He gave up his powers to save me.
A guy he didn't even know.
No one's ever done anything like that for me before.
I need to tell him how much that means to me.
Well, all right.
Uh... just give me a little while.
I'll see what I can do.

Uh, you sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure. Look... we can't just sit here.
Regardless of whether I have my speed or not, I have to try to help. That's never gonna change.
