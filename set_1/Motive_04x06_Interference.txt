She hit this straight-on.

Oh, more than once. That's a lot of muscle to punch through.
I was just running the circuit earlier, and I saw her sitting on the bench.

No, she was alone.

No. Not that I saw.

Yep. I compared their medical charts.
Symptoms are exactly the same.

He also said that you were his favorite teacher.
I can't think of him without hearing his laugh.
I always thought, if I had a son, I hoped he would be just like Aiden.
Then he got sick.
When Aiden died, everyone thought it was a tragic accident.
Except for you.
And then you found out about Owen.

Hey!

Stop!
Hey! Stop!
Let go of me!
How long have you been following us?
You're sick, Tracy. You need help.
What are you talking about?
You hurt those boys.
You're hurting Owen.
If I see you again, I'm calling the cops.
Oh, yeah? Never mind. I'll do it myself. I'll call the police.
Fine. It'll make getting a restraining order that much easier.
Yeah? Two boys. Both sick.
Let's see what they say now.
You stay away from us!
You stay away from him.

Help me.

We found your complaint with Child Services.
The one you made after Aiden passed away.
I've been a teacher for years.
I've seen every type of kid, every type of parent, and I just knew, there was something wrong with that woman.
But you had no proof?
No. So they didn't do anything, and Tracy got away with murder.
You were right about her.
We believe she suffered from Munchausen by Proxy.
She poisoned the boys to get attention.
(exhales deeply)
I swear, I didn't plan to kill her.
I know. I believe you.
Thank you.
I still have to arrest you.

Doctors say he'll make a full recovery.
I still can't believe she was poisoning my son.
That she almost...
I can't condone what Cindy did, but, uh...
But she saved your son's life.
Because of her, I get a second chance with Owen.

I was outside the station and I, uh, I see a guy hanging around the building, like he was casing it, you know?
Describe him.
He was tall. Six, six-one, maybe.
Short brown hair.
Brown eyes?
And a beard.
And then what happened?
Then he waited until someone in a lab coat showed up, and he followed 'em in.
Why are you coming forward now?
See, the night I saw him, I was...
I was dealing, but I'm... I'm clean now. Straight.
I'm... I should've come forward sooner.
Kelly's got blue eyes.
Now, if you don't know the answer, you don't say anything. You got it?
So, I, uh... I say all this, you gonna make those possession charges go away, right?
Again. From the top.
Long day, huh?
Long couple days.
Yeah, well... cases with kids are always hard.
Yeah.
Hey, you wanna join me for a, I don't know, virgin pina colada? (chuckles)
Sure, that'd be nice.
Good.
♪
Although, to be clear, mine will not be virgin.
Yeah, I figured.
