Previously on House of Lies...
Clyde just took Jeannie's office, like that.
(GRUNTS) No... It's mine!
It's mine!
You guys make this sh1t better.
We'll make it better.
See that?
That's why Clyde gets the office.
Kelsey.
What, Clyde?
You got a real, functional heart in there.
I don't want to share you with anyone.
What's this?
Your letter of resignation.
I filed a sexual harassment claim against you.
f*ck these guys.
Okay, f*ck 'em.
You bought me out on stock options.
You're welcome, Grant.
Oh, f*ck.
We pay you to walk the f*ck away.
Skip, go f*ck yourself.
(MARTY SIGHS)
What are these M*therf*ckers waiting on? Yo!
Play...
You know what, f*ck it. I'm just gonna hit.
This sh1t wouldn't happen at Augusta, man.
Oh, this definitely isn't Augusta.
'Cause if it was Augusta, we'd be carrying trays right now.
I wouldn't be carrying no tray.
sh1t.
sh1t.
: All right, f*ck it, let's go play Augusta, man.
(CHUCKLES) Well, we just gonna apparate there like Harry Potter?
No, we gonna jump on my G5. I got a tee time for 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.
We get on my plane, get there, eat a steak.
And after that, wake up in the morning, hit that sh1t.
Mm.
Be a lovely, lovely time.
It would be a lovely, lovely time.
But I have a lovely, lovely job, remember?
Not all of us parachuted out at 38.
I forgot, you're the guy that flies around the country telling people richer than you are...
Mm.
How to get even richer while you stay the same.
That's right. My bad, my bad.
Yup.
My... my bad.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That-that's me. For now.
Like this nut bucket you got in New Mexico. Why don't you tell him he's on the "life's too short" list?
Because my man is worth 11 billion racks.
The m*therf*cker's in space.
I like the M*therf*ckers in space, Donald.
That's why you're not in my business.
I need 'em out there. That way, I can extract the money, you know? Deplete that bank account.
Sometimes a gig is just a gig, okay?
Can't all be limos and blow jobs all the time.
(HONKS)
Holy sh1t.
Speaking of blow jobs.
Marty Kaan!
Aw, f*ck me.
Skip Galweather.
No, f*ck me!
Holy sh1t!
I'm sorry, um, was I holding you up?
Little bit.
So-so sorry.
I called the clubhouse; they said no problem keeping you guys waiting, so I can catch up to my guys.
Yeah, yeah, here we go.
What the f*ck are you doing?
I just got an old shoulder injury.
I got to stretch it out. Here we go.
Yeah, that's good.
Why don't you just drop one down in the fairway there and say it's one?
Well, I would like to, but I'm not going to.
(MUTTERING) Son of a bitch.
Thank you, guys.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Here we go.
Don't want to use one of your balls?
Yeah, thanks for teeing up for me, Martin.
I appreciate that.
There we go.
280 down the middle of the fairway.
: Oh, my God.
I think I recognize your foursome.
It's the Monopoly guy.
Mm-hmm.
And that's Colonel Sanders.
The dude on the right, isn't that... that's Satan.
Yeah, that looks like him.
It makes no difference who those guys are, except that they're very important; important enough to keep you waiting on the golf course.
Yeah, I wouldn't hit into Colonel Sanders or Satan.
No, definitely not Satan.
Hey, Martin?
Yeah?
You and I should play a round of golf sometime.
Talk about life.
It's never gonna happen.
(LAUGHS)
See, that's the sh1t I'm talking about.
You're very odd this morning.
I'm odd every morning.
So, you know my app Fruity Face?
Yeah.
It sold.
Like a real offer?
Actually, we closed yesterday.
f*ck yeah! Way to go.
Seven figures.
What...?
That's amazing.
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
Seven figures for Fruit Man, Fruity Man.
Fruity Face.
Fruity Face, Fruity Face.
Wow...
Hey, hey!
Oh, my God, look at you two.
So cute.
Hi, Doug.
Hey.
Look, sorry to take up precious moments here, but do you mind if I bend your ear for just a second?
No.
Ha, ha!
Anyway, my Dungeons & Dragons mentee, now client, Tess Symington, aka Sabretha, has asked for a D&D; tutorial.
Tutorial? Really?
See, as her Dungeon Master, it puts me in a very delicate situation, because I know in the real world, she's a powerful businesswoman, but she's a fragile virgin in the world we inhabit together.
If I hadn't saved her ass, she'd have perished in the Lair of Abrax the Evil.
(LAUGHS) And that's a level one!
Bye, Doug.
We'll talk later.
Wait, so is she or isn't she looking for something more?
Clyde? Clyde?
That's right.
All of it, bitch.
You know, this could be difficult, but you make it so much easier.
Hustle it up!
And don't leave any of your girly snot and tears on my furniture, okay?
You know, I actually don't feel safe being in the same room with you.
Seeing as you're a known workplace predator.
Would you just show me one sexy ball on the way out, Clyde?
: Aw...
Bless your heart, Clyde.
: Are you f*cking kidding me right now?
Sweet, sweet Clyde.
I really feel for you, buddy.
You know what, Doug?
Get that patronizing bullshit out of my f*cking face.
I know, I know.
I get it. Thought you made it..
No!
Into Marty's most intimate circle.
And here comes Jeannie, and just like that, you're out.
Booted unceremoniously down the hall, out of his embrace, for the old puss-ay.
Ew.
Come here, bring it in.
Get the f*ck away from me.
Yeah, come...
Sincerely, Doug, get the f*ck away from me.
I know you want this Guggenlove!
Get off of my...
You leave me the f*ck alone. I don't...
How's this? There it is.
I don't...
Right?
Guys having a little sword fight down below?
(CHUCKLES)
You see, real men can hold each other.
: Marty Kaan, once again sticking it right in my f*cking ass!
You told me that I would have autonomy within my team!
And you believed me, even after you tried to kill me.
Dick.
Yeah, and somehow you still cash my checks.
I cash your checks because you wedged me into a buyout, and now you're squeezing my balls on the little bit of turf I have left here.
Hmm.
I'm really thinking of pulling my people out of here.
: Oh, well, that would be stupid even for you, Grant.
I'm sick of your sh1t, Marty!
Something tells me that your people would not follow you.
Oh, you want to see?
Why don't we see?
I think it's called a contract.
Fucker!
Hey, Jeannie, welcome back. And good-bye.
Okay, come on, come on, come on, come on!
I happen to know that the two of you have a grudging fondness for one another.
: Huh! Oh, you know, it's not personal.
He's just a f*cking asshole.
Okay, I also happen to know that Marty sees you as a major leader in the media division moving forward.
: Media?
Hmm.
Right, Marty?
Yeah.
I was gonna tell you before you burst in here acting like an asshole.
: Just give me a minute with Marty and we will pick it up again.
I promise.
All right.
Douche bag.
Dickhead.
Fuck-stick.
Cum-stain.
(HIGH VOICE) "Hey, Grant, how about you run our media department?"
What the f*ck are you doing to me?
You're not a people person, Marty.
Really? You think?
I'm not just talking about Grant Stevens.
I think you need help.
No, I do not.
We're trying to assimilate eight different companies here, Marty, and you insist on going on the road every week.
What the fu...? I got to land what I got to land, boo.
I'm not trying to argue.
I just think it would benefit us to bring in some help.
Now, I know he's a dick, but you cannot argue that he's good.
(LAUGHS)
He just got out of his contract with Denna Altschuler.
No.
And this is what he's great at.
No, no, no.
It's exactly what he does.
Do not say...
: Ron Zobel!
I am not bringing that fuck-nut into this company.
I don't care that he's a great turnaround artist.
And I don't care that his loyalties have realigned.
You cannot come in here and just blow my sh1t up on day one.
Okay?
So... no.
: Flight 930 to Santa Fe.
So the COO is an old B-school classmate of mine and his name is Yurgen Celebi.
Yurgen.
And, uh, his boss is Sean Chew, yeah.
Sean Chew.
Made his first billion at 26 by starting Everyshirt.
Basically built a better mousetrap.
Revolutionized fulfillment though.
But now he's into this whole Holacracy kick. You know, no hierarchy, no bosses.
Celebi thinks it's gonna tank the company.
Probably right. Doug!
What are you doing?
Doug?
Wait, no, I'm just, I'm... guys!
This is a big deal! The K and A super-pod back together.
Sorry.
I just, I want to document it.
Yeah.
Just get a quick one, get a quick one.
Hold on, let me do it.
You can't bump me, 'cause it'll shake.
(ALL TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)
: Hold it straight, Doug!
: Hold on a second! No, Jeannie!
There's mine. You got her.
Wait...
Here's a quick one for you.
No, rude.
Well, fine, you'll thank me when you get these framed for Christmas.
I'm still not sure I see the advantages of Holacracy.
: You don't see the advantages of Holacracy?
Okay, whoa, Jesus!
Close.
(LAUGHS)
Sean Chew, humble visionary.
Come inside.
Kaan and Associates, come inside.
Marty.
Hey!
What's happening, man?
Good to see you.
All right, good to see you, brother.
Uh, drone's gone?
Yeah, I think it's gone.
Uh, Yurgen Celebi, this is Jeannie van der Hooven, Doug Guggenheim, Clyde Oberholt.
This is my top team.
Good, cool, great, awesome and other superlatives.
Look, I got orders from Sean to bring you directly to him.
Okay.
So just...
Marty, this Holacracy thing, it's f*cking my sh1t up, okay?
I mean, no bosses, no organization.
Anybody can be in any meeting any f*cking time?
What the f*ck kind of sh1t is that?
This whole thing is going pear-shaped.
Dude is off the motherfucking reservation.
And get this, I'm employee number two up in this bitch, right?
But I can't cash out for another two years.
Now what if... what if he blows this before then?
Yurgen, we are here, and we have your back, okay?
Don't worry about it, buddy.
Okay. All right. Thank you, Marty.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Oh, of course.
We don't do it for the thanks.
(ELEVATOR WHIRRING)
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Sean Chew.
I got to tell you, this is a great...
Shh.
What's happening?
Mmm.
I smell your brilliance.
Uh, yeah, well, uh, we were stuck on that tarmac for a while.
You're tired of it.
Even though you're getting everything you want, aren't you, Marty Kaan?
Um... no.
I'm-I'm good. We're just here to help you, buddy.
We all are.
Absolutely.
Your piece in Forbes about the soul of the customer, it changed my life.
Really, Clyde?
I think I'm the one who told you about Sean Chew and his online retail revolution.
I don't think so, buddy.
Yeah, pretty sure.
Are you kidding? You girls can't do this later?
No, it's... I'm just...
It was in 2012. It's written in my planner.
Shush.
I'm sure Yurgen wants me to give up on Holacracy, doesn't he?
Well, I've been pretty frank about that, Sean.
: Do you understand Holacracy?
Do you "grok" Holacracy?
Uh, I understand it.
I'm not sure that I "grok" it.
: Marty, if I may.
Sean, I got this.
"Grok" was originally coined by Robert A. Heinlein in his seminal 1961 sci-fi novel, A Stranger in a Strange Land. (CHUCKLES)
It essentially means to take something in so deeply...
You Doug?
: Am I Doug? Yes, sir.
Yes. Oh, my God. Doug Guggenheim.
Ow!
Yes!
Doug needs to shut the f*ck up while I mind-meld with Marty.
: Hey, Douglas, do you grok shutting the f*ck up?
Listen, all of you. Marty.
Pretty blonde. Jewish guy.
Sure.
Doug.
Holacracy is how we're going to evolve as a species.
No boundaries, no hierarchies, no titles.
Uh, for example, you, excuse me, you.
What do you do here?
Oh, hey, I'm Dicky. I'm in fulfillment.
Like, I pack boxes full of shirts.
Dicky, you are here attending a meeting at the highest level of this company because you felt that you had something to contribute.
Isn't that right?
Uh, really just... they allow us to take a break to attend meetings, and the AC is way better in this building.
Ah.
: See, Marty, now I know.
Now I know.
Let's make sure the AC in the fulfillment center is equal to the AC here.
I see you, Marty Kaan.
You're the ultimate skeptic.
Uh, you got me.
: You're the man for whom the bell tolls.
(BELL TOLLS)
It tolls for thee.
You're here to help me. You're here to help Everyshirt.
But I'm going to help you.
Yes, by inculcating you into a very special philosophy.
If I can win you over to the way of seeing, being that is Holacracy, then I know that I am on the right track.
You know how I'm gonna do that?
(DRUM BEATING, RHYTHMIC CLAPPING)
(CHANTING, YELPING)
Oh, my God, they're Satanists.
sh1t, I forgot my Satanist outfit.
Shh.
Greetings, my friends, my new friends and associates.
Today we participate in a sacred ceremony, one that has been practiced for thousands of years.
Yep, told you.
: The practice of partaking of the remarkable teaching properties of the ayahuasca.
Yagé.
Shori, natem.
Call it what you like, it will still take you exactly where you need to go, let you see what you need to see.
This is Majo...
Hey, Majo.
: That's Majo?
: ...our shaman.
She will be your guide on this transformational path.
I welcome you all to the spirit realm.
Is there a bathroom?
(WOMAN CHANTING INDISTINCTLY, DRUM BEATING)
It's good. Uh, just, does it have gluten in it?
I just... because I've got some dietary...
Sure, yeah.
: What does it taste like?
(GRUNTS)
No, I'm good. I'm gonna pass.
I'm good. I...
(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)
Uh, I'll have a little.
Just, like, a half.
(GASPS)
: Ugh, ugh.
(GAGS)
(WHISPERS)
(GAGS)
(EASTERN MUSIC)
(INDISTINCT CHANTING)
Oh, yeah, nothing.
Kelsey.
Kelsey.
I'm gonna give you a sacred orgasm.
I'm sorry.
When you get back, I'm gonna make some very sweet love to you.
Sweet love!
(EASTERN MUSIC)
All right, f*ck the dumb sh1t!
(MUSIC STOPS)
News flash.
I don't feel a f*cking thing.
Shaman says close my eyes and watch the movie of my spirit.
Know what happens when I close my eyes?
I see a to-do list.
I see my company.
(CHUCKLES) I see the people I'm responsible to.
I mean, is that the movie of my spirit?
The f*cking to-do list?
This guy's not thinking about his to-do list.
Yeah, these two right here?
Definitely not thinking about the job.
Oh, wait, now this crazy m*therf*cker, yeah, he's probably thinking about the job, but not in the same way that I'm thinking about the job.
All right, I got to close this m*therf*cker.
So let's do this sh1t.
(MUSIC RESUMES)
(COUGHING)
Gnome.
And... and blue goblin.
And...
Smelly Jesus, tell me, tell me, tell me now.
Does Tess-slash-Sabretha really want a D&D; tutorial?
Or does she want a lover?
(EXHALES)
(CRIES)
Oh, Majo.
Majo.
(SNIFFLES)
That's your name, right?
Doesn't matter anymore.
Let it go.
(SOBS)
Let him go.
Oh, Majo.
Your breath is really f*cking with my high.
Kelsey, hey.
Hey, you okay?
I'm very altered right now, but I'm good.
I just wanted to connect with you to say that I miss you.
Hey, Clyde, there's no great way to do this, but I really feel the longer we put it off, the worse it'll be.
No f*cking way.
Well, it just...
You're breaking up with me?
(SCOFFS) Clyde, can you please...?
Right now, over the f*cking phone, No, I just... Can we...?
While I'm tripping on ayahuasca, and you're probably sitting there writing code?
(WOMAN LAUGHS)
Come on, you know things have been weird lately.
No, you're probably... you're probably right though.
That's probably a good move, Kels.
You just got so weird about the Fruity Face thing, and...
No, no, no, I totally get it.
Yeah, break it off.
Uh-huh.
f*ck!
Have we been here a long time?
Have we been here a long time?
: Marty. Marty.
Marty.
(LAUGHS)
I'm so happy. I'm so happy.
I... I see God.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
(LAUGHS)
Marty.
Do you think that we will ever...?
Do... do you think that our daughter...
Jeannie, Jeannie.
Will ever...
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie.
See us...
Boo, boo, boo, listen.
You're going through something really profound right now, (CHUCKLES) but I'm just... I'm not there yet.
You're not?
No.
You're right.
I know. You're Marty Kaan.
You're working.
You're about to close Everyshirt.
There you go.
But I... I see you.
I see you, Marty.
Because I have a God-eye right in the center of my forehead.
Right here.
And it sees you, and it sees that you have a giant circle around your head, like the mane of a lion.
(GROWLS)
(GENTLE ELECTRONIC MUSIC)
(PHONE BEEPS)
(COUGHS AND VOMITS)
I just need some time to take it all in.
Okay? Bye. Bye-bye.
: f*ck, that's soft.
That's so soft.
Dakota. Hey, Dakota.
Dakota, it's Clyde.
We're gonna make sweet, sweet love.
I don't know you, man.
You know Clyde. Beautiful man. Sacred orgasm.
We were near the pots and the spoons?
I don't know you, fur man.
I need to find my pants.
(ROCK MUSIC)
(HISSES)
You're Cobra.
I am Cobra Lord.
(HISSING, WHOOSHING)
Guess I'm a lion, then.
(ROARS)
m*therf*cker.
(GROWLING, HISSING)
(ROARS)
Sean, Yurgen, janitorial staff, I.T. guys.
(LAUGHS)
I don't know what happened last night.
I mean, was it real?
I do not f*cking know.
Felt real.
But what does "real" mean anymore?
Object, subject, fantasy, reality... these words, they just they don't have the same meaning for me anymore.
I'll tell you what I do know.
Sean and I, we left our physical bodies and we made an agreement on a higher plane.
And we agreed that Holacracy is a noble experiment and it's worth a try.
What the f*ck?
But you're gonna need us to guide you, to advise you.
Doug Guggenheim will be heading up our Holacracy transition advisory team.
Right, Doug?
Uh, what? Yes. Yes.
(SLOT MACHINE CHIMES)
There you go. Clyde Oberholt!
Yes!
I will, of course, be moving the technology of Holacracy synergy and integration into the 25th century.
I.T. team, do you hear me?
(SLOT MACHINE CHIMES)
(CHEERING)
Yes, yes. And Jeannie van der Hooven and myself...
Ooh! Will be working closely with Sean to continue to advance the vision quest that is Holacracy.
(APPLAUSE)
(MARTY LAUGHS)
Okay. Yeah.
Because make no mistake, people, this is a vision quest.
But it's gonna take work.
It's going to take imagination.
It's gonna take faith.
And a fuck-load of after-work.
(SLOT MACHINE CHIMES)
(COINS CASCADING)
Yeah!
(UPBEAT MUSIC)
♪ Dah dah-dah dah-dah! ♪
Marty!
Marty...
Oh, boy.
You f*ck!
You f*ck! You piece of sh1t!
You just f*cked me in every hole!
Whoa! Whoa. Okay.
Just take a breath, all right, buddy?
What? Take a breath?
Yurgen, Yurgen, Yurgen.
How much are you worth thanks to Sean Chew?
No, no.
No, Marty. You don't get it. What you just did to me...
You, you, you, you.
You did it to me.
You, you, you. How much, personally?
You?
On paper?
Over a billion dollars.
What? That's... huh? Over what?!
Holy sh1t!
That's amazing.
So if Sean thinks that Holacracy is the sh1t, don't you have the common sense to just play that out?
I mean, has he ever been right before?
Let me see.
Every f*cking time.
Come on.
Yurgen.
He's the Cobra Lord.
Wait.
How do you know about Cobra Lord?
(CHUCKLES) You're welcome.
How do you know that?
The f*ck?
Martin Kaan.
Ron Zobel? What the...
(LAUGHING) Oh, I agree, man.
What the f*ck am I doing here?
I mean, after our last go-round, buddy, I thought, "Next time I see that dickhead, I hope it's to piss into his open coffin."
Yeah. But I...
But then I got your message last night, man.
And, I mean, the way you talked about working together...
What words did you use? Hold it. You-you... you hyperintellectual mind-fucker.
What was it?
It was, uh, "co-operative biosphere of aggressive post-capitalism," or whatever else you were talking about with the sort of... God and colors, and, I mean, it was genuinely, it was genuinely visionary... visionary stuff.
So listen. I just have a couple loose ends I need to tie up, you know, in some other sectors, but then, oh, I'm yours, balls deep, my brother.
Um... okay, but...
All right, now look, now look, now look.
I know about Skip's offer, okay?
And don't think that it didn't also influence my decision a little bit.
And I know that you're less than enthusiastic about this idea, but listen, you know what? We're just gonna let it sit.
Let's just let that brilliant Martin Kaan mind just...
Huh? Like bread and bouillabaisse, okay?
'Cause we don't want your ex-wife walking away with all that money.
My...
Did you not know about that?
She's the so-called "front-runner."
But, listen, I'm betting we're gonna blow her right out of the water!
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Did you save that message?
(EXHALES)
(LAUGHING)
I don't know what that means.
No, Ron, I need to hear the message.
: So they can't wear armor or a mage's robe, uh, so obviously, in that scenario, the last thing you want to be is a warforged monk.
Okay.
I guess that makes sense.
Does it?
Yeah? So does that...
(CLEARS THROAT)
Yeah.
All right, so that's... that's what you're after?
I mean, yeah, it's helpful.
The dumplings are great.
Yeah.
I-I mean, you wouldn't think they'd travel, but... (LAUGHS)
Honestly, they're...
It's like magic dumplings or something.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Yeah. Okay.
I think, I think we both know what I'm about to ask you, and, uh, I just, I wanted you to know...
Okay, wait.
Is this about my arcane spell failure?
(CHUCKLES) What? No.
Uh, no.
'Cause I...
No, that was, that was bad, but no, that's not what this is about.
Okay, I...
It's, um...
Look, I-I think, uh...
Well, am I way off, or-or do you think you might consider maybe, I don't know, um... uh... going out with me?
Wow. That's so junior high.
(LAUGHS)
No, I-I mean...
Wait. No shame spiral.
I didn't say that I wasn't into you.
I am, actually, kind of into you.
So, yeah, I would go out with you.
Whatever.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Did I see Ron Zobel in here?
A while ago?
Yeah. Um...
Apparently, I was a little less in control than I thought I was last night, and I hired him.
Good call.
My brain feels like dog sh1t from that ayahuasca.
(EXHALES)
But, man, was that something.
I was a f*cking lion.
Yes, you were!
Do you even want me back at K and A, Marty?
Are you kidding me?
Don't make a joke.
I'm just... feeling very fragile, and, um, 'cause of the whole thing, and the ayahuasca has got me questioning everything.
Jeannie, I am f*cking thrilled.
I can't do this sh1t without you.
Good answer.
Oh, man.
(SIGHS) Mm...
It's a comfy couch, huh?
Mm-hmm.
You have one of those in your office?
Oh! Yeah, gotcha.
