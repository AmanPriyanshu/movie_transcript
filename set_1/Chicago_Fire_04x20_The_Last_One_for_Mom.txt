Oh, wow, no, you should definitely get that looked at.
Draw some blood to rule a few things out, okay?
Just be honest with me. You're saying I have cancer?
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Can I ask you a favor?
No sweat. What's up?
Give my son a tour of 51.
Sure. Everything okay?
She's prepping for a narcotics case.
Mexican nationals. Brutally violent.
State's attorney's calling her in to testify.
Susan Weller, political consultant.
I work with some of the biggest names in the party.
I think you've got a national future ahead of you, and I'd be happy to help shape it.
Okay.
So, uh, where you from?
Chicago. Born and raised.
Really? Where at?
Talcott and Odell.
Dad had a place with a fantastic view of 90.
No way.
I was Talcott and Nordica.
Could hit the highway from my bedroom window.
You're kidding.
You were three blocks away from me?
Yeah.
Get out.
Hi.
Hey.
Sorry, sorry.
Parking was a nightmare.
Uh, Susan, this is Gabriela Dawson, my...
Girlfriend. Hi.
I researched the campaign.
It was hard to find a photograph of Alderman Casey without you standing beside him.
It was Gabby's idea for me to run.
Oh, smart girl.
Did I miss the pitch?
No, but I'll take that as my cue.
I've worked on 18 campaigns, had 18 candidates elected.
People tend to think that my trick is great campaigning, but it's actually that I always pick the right horse.
Look, I appreciate your confidence, and I don't want to waste your time.
I ran for alderman to fix my ward, not start a political career.
You don't have to decide anything now.
I'm just the person you keep in your back pocket during your term.
Media strategy, the platforms you throw your weight behind...
I can give you advice, but nothing's official unless there's a campaign.
I think I'm missing something here.
What exactly would he be campaigning for?
Pretty much whatever you want.
Senate, mayor. Take your pick.
Hey, Kelly.
Hey.
Have you seen Pouch?
Hey, I love you.
Love you too.
Mmm.
Be nice to Kelly.
Yeah.
"Pleases" and "thank yous."
Okay.
Oh, thank God that dog was here.
And you, of course.
Thanks again for doing this.
He got this assignment at school, and it just seemed like the perfect excuse to keep him at 51.
Like I said, no problem.
(SIGHS)
Trial starts today?
I go on the stand in a couple hours.
Things have calmed down.
The sooner I get this over with, the sooner my life goes back to normal.
You sure you're okay with J.J.?
Yeah, no problem. I've got him.
Okay, thanks.
Yeah.
Want to come up on the couch?

Okay. What's next?
Why is firefighting so important?
What's going on?
Detective Holloway's been shot.
They're prepping her for surgery now at Med.
What happened?
We believe the shooter was stationed across from the courthouse.
As soon as Holloway pulled up, shots were fired.
It was a hit?
Yes.
She said you guys cleared the threat.
That things had calmed down.
We thought so.
I'll get J.J. I'll take him to Med.
No, you can't.
For now, Chicago Med's on lockdown.
This guy had a getaway car waiting.
He's in the wind.
He finds out he didn't finish the job, he might come back.
I can't let J.J. anywhere near Med.
Officer John Lucas. I'm with peer support.
I contacted Holloway's emergency contact, a sister in California.
With the circumstances, she asked that we not tell J.J. what happened until after she arrives.
What do we do in the meantime?
I'll take J.J. for the day... go to a movie, get some lunch, keep him busy.
No, that kid's a smart kid.
As soon as you take him away from here, he's gonna know something's wrong.
He's been hanging out in here for three shifts.
I know him. He trusts me.
We'll have to provide protection.
Squad cars can be stationed out front.
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)
So J.J.'s aunt really didn't want us to tell him anything?
Yeah, she's about six hours out.
Six hours. All right.
Well, that's plenty of time to make the best damn video that this third grade's ever seen, so if we're not out on call or doing drills, we should all be on J.J. duty.
We can give this kid a good day.
Chief, I can't leave the firehouse today.
I've got Connie calling for a relief, Lieutenant.
She'll be here soon.
Thank you.
She'll be all right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You wanted to see me, Chief?
Yeah, come on in.
Just had a phone call from a Liz Brexel... woman from the art gallery.
How's Armand?
He's gonna be fine, but Liz is asking for the names of the firefighters who pulled him out, and she is being insistent.
I've pushed her off for now, but you have got to know this might come back.
Those extra minutes we spent outside we could've spent attacking that fire.
Severide's already spoken to you about this call, right?
Yes.
You don't need to hear it from me.
Cruz.
There are two kinds of mistakes.
There is the inevitable, and then there are the ones that you could have just avoided.
Listening to orders... that stops the latter.
Listen up, guys, you'll be happy to know that the Firefighting and Leadership Conference board have agreed to let teach a four-hour seminar called "Lead From the Front," which'll give us free passes to the conference and free meals for three days.
So we're still paying for most of the trip, and now we're working?
I like the name.
Oh, thanks, man.
Hey, Otis, did you ever hear any follow-up from Dr. Halstead?
Why would I hear a follow-up?
It's normal.
Doctors call back to check how you're doing.
Yeah, but like I told you, it wasn't anything, so why would I need a follow-up?
Hey.
Hey.
Why were there cops here?
Uh, just checking in.
We're helping them out with a case.
Okay, so who's next?
When did I fall in love with this job?
Before I was even doing it.
When I was a kid, we had firefighters come to our school.
They came with all the gear, the truck.
They even let us climb up top, and, yeah, I knew right then.
I'm proud of what I do, of this job. of the people.
There is no more honorable way to spend your life.
Sometimes when you help somebody else, you help yourself too.
Huh.
