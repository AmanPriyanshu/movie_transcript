This chart represents the typical asset allocation of a high net worth individual.
60% in equities, 25% in municipal securities, 10% in real estate, and 5% in corporate bonds.
It's balanced. It's diversified.
A conservative approach that can sustain fluctuations in the stock market, home prices, or interest rates.
And this is Normandy Parker's chart.
90% of his assets are tied down in one investment.
Sourdough Subs.
I mean, the only people with less diversification in their portfolios are drug dealers who stash their cash underneath a mattress.
All right, sir, we got two homicide cases.
Is math class really necessary?
Keep going.
Six months before Normandy's shot, someone was building a large short position in Sourdough Subs.
What's a short position?
Uh, it's when you place a bet that a company's stock will go down instead of up.
Normandy gets shot, and the stock drops 20% in a straight line.
So somebody made a fortune.
So you short the stock, you take Normandy out, and you, uh, get the cash before anyone notices.
I mean, it's a... it's a smart idea.
Yeah.
Could Sam have been shorting his own stock?
It's doubtful. Sam was the majority shareholder.
He'd make $10 million in the short position and lose $20 million in stock value.
I say if anything, Sam was a victim of the short position.

But I-I knew that he was full of sh1t.
So did you do it?
I would never do that to Normandy.

Sam Rydell had a $10 million insurance policy out on Normandy Parker.

You become CEO of a publicly traded company, and then you take out a key man policy on that company's spokesman.
Sam needed quick cash or his whole scheme would fall apart.
So his own play was to take out Normandy and collect on the claim.
So if Sam hollowed out the company, then Normandy's stock is virtually worthless, right?

Yep.
You're a total motorhead.
Let's just say there's a little more to me than just cutting up dead bodies.
No, I like it.
Well, my ex did not, but thank you.
Mm.
I'm sorry that you guys couldn't work things out.
I wasn't supposed to bring that up.
Why?
You're not supposed to bring up ex-relationships on a first date. That is rule number one.
According to who?
According to an article I read in "Cosmo."
"Cosmo"?
Mm-hmm.
[Laughs]
Don't go dissing on "Cosmo."
It's a valuable source of information for the recently divorced who would like to ignite a second act.
So...
Is that what this is? A second act?
Well... I'm hoping.
Cheers.
[Glass clinks]
: 
Hey, I just wanted to give you an update on Sam.
Yeah, gone missing. I heard.
Right. Well, we will find him.
We'll find him, sir.
Uh, if you don't need anything else, I was gonna head home.
You know, every time we make progress in this case, we hit a dead end.
Sam will pop up, sir.
It's really difficult these days to, uh, disappear.
Soon as he breathes, we'll get him.
Sit.
I won't tell if you don't.
Uh-oh!
[Snips]
[Snips]
So, uh, word has it that you're going out for the, uh, the D.A. job.
Is that true?
Nah.
That's just a rumor.
There you go.
[Clears throat]
No, I probably shouldn't tell you this, but...
I got offered something last year.
Mnh-mnh.
I turned it down.
For real? Why?
Mm.
[Lighter clicks]
[Exhales]
Come on, leave this place to go practice law?
[Case closes]
I couldn't do it.
Hey, man.
I know you've been through the ringer recently.
But you'll get past this.
All right, you'll feel like a cop again.
[Sighs] Man, I hope so.
There's baggage that comes with the job.
Sometimes it's personal, sometimes it's professional.
Most of the time, it's both.
But it's worth it.
Only people who wear the badge know that.
You know, you can't explain it to someone.
You can't... you can't tell them what it's like to be a cop.
So, uh, how's Hildy doing with all this, huh?
She... she hate me now? [Laughs]
[Telephone rings]
[Ring]
Koto.
Where?
Yeah, we're on our way.
[Hangs up receiver]
Put those out. We're on the move.
Okay, what do we got?
Vehicle registration, Detective.
[Engine rumbling]
[Rumbling continues]
Oh, boy.
[Sighs]
Thanks.
All right, see ya.
Yeah.
[Engine revving]
[Exhales deeply] Hey.
Hey.
Sam's car?
Yeah. [Clears throat]
No damage.
Clearly, he wasn't forced off the road.
Whoever he was with had his keys.
See if there's anything inside.
I got something here. It's a jacket.
What's this?
S.R.
Sam Rydell.
Uh-huh.
Wang Fun Karaoke Bar. Huh.
Yeah, the Tongs own that spot.
So he owed the Tongs money, couldn't pay up, they threw him off the bridge.
Or they tried to scare him and something happened.
Either way, it's a long way down.
