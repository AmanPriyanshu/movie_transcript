Don't worry, guys. I am sure that Jay and Carlos will be here any minute.
You said that 15 minutes ago.
I'm sure they're just around the corner.
I just hope that corner isn't on the other side of Auradon.
How big is this carpet they're picking us up in?
I don't do crowded.
Oh, it's a mid-size, so we'll be fine.
But from what I heard about Jay, I'm sure it's stolen.
Jay doesn't steal... much.
We're going to be riding in a stolen carpet?
All right! This party just got interesting.
What's the wind situation like on this carpet?
Should I be worried about my hair?
No, because I packed hair helmets for everyone.
I designed them myself!
I take back everything bad I ever said about you.
What did you say about me?
Nothing!
Bravo, ladies! Superbly sweet moment.
But since Carlos and Jay are a no-show, we need to figure out how to get to the party straight away.
Do you have a spare magic carpet?
Oh, because I'm a genie who lives in a lamp, I automatically fly around on an old rug?
She didn't pass her carpet driver's test.
I'm taking it again next week. 13th time's the charm.
Jane, you're all magical now. Can't you whip us up a ride?
Hey, I can help.
No offense, Mal, but the VKs are clearly not coming through today.
Sorry.
That's all right.
Normally, I would let you help out, but whenever you get involved it leads to disaster. No offense.
Okay?
It's because you destroy everything you touch. No offense.
So, do you know what "no offense" means?
'Cause I'm starting to take some.
Please don't take it that way.
It's only I don't trust you, no off... Sorry.
Jane, what do you say?
Can you bibbidi bobbidi us up some transpo?
Oh, I-I don't know if I can do...
No presh, but if I don't get to the party soon, I am going to die.
What about Lonnie? Can't she pick us up?
She went early to set up the DJ equipment, but I'm sure I can try something magical.
Jane, let's see what you've got.
Uh, well, I'm really very new to this whole magic thing.
Uh... Bibbidi bobbidi!
Whoa.
That's a vegetable.
Well, it's a gourd.
Gourd! Just...
Does it fly?
That won't do.
I get car-sick on flying pumpkins.
It's not a flying pumpkin!
Oh, so we're heading to the party in some sort of pumpkin boat.
It's not a boat.
A pumpkin took-took?
No!
Pumpkin trolley?
No!
Pumpkin roller skates, then.
I can't be seen in that. Pumpkin clashes with my eyes.
Yeah. I don't think that will help me get more viewers for my web show.
Guys! Let Jane do her thing.
Go ahead, Jane.
Thank you!
Like Cindy's pumpkin carriage, a legend to us all... an even sweeter ride shall take us to the Neon Lights Ball!
Sweet ride!
Wait, this veggie car is carb dried.
I'm not going to get nasty grease seeds on my dress, am I?
Nope. All clear.
And it's green. Runs on vegetable oil!
Great! We'll all show up to the party smelling like salad dressing.
Nice work, Jane. You know I couldn't have done it better myself.
Oh, it's nothing.
Just bending the laws of the universe. It's by my mother's forbiddance!
I can't believe that Carlos and Jay flaked.
I know. And we've been working so hard to get people on our side!
If you, ladies, don't get in here, I'm gonna turn into a pumpkin.
That doesn't even make sense.
Your hair doesn't make sense!
