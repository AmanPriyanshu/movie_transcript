I know you're my mother now.
I can't be that for you.
How long you plan on being away?
There's one thing that I have to do. I'm gonna find my real dad.
Peter. Husband number three... the one who got away.
You humiliated me in front of those horrible men.
It's work.
And work takes priority.
I'm starting to get that. [Scoffs]
It's good that you're going. I need some time.
You're this hot, intelligent, successful woman.
Why would you want to be with a guy like me?
Fashion exec just bought this place. She's gonna be gone for six months.
This really cute guy came over and assumed I owned the house.
I broke up with my mother, so can I stay here?
With me?
I don't have anywhere else to go.
I'm barely used to hanging out with you. Can we agree to never talk about s*x?
That feels nice!
I'm so glad you like it. [Gasps]
Spence Westmore, you're under arrest for the murder of Peri Westmore.
No, no, he didn't do it!
[Crying] I'm Shannon. I'm Peri's sister.
And she doesn't know anything about The Circle?
She doesn't have a clue.
There's this bad man named Ben. Maybe he's got someone spying on me.
I was thinking, if I follow Miss Shannon, I can find out where The Circle meets.
Someone's going around asking about Peri's murder.
What's in this? [Coughs]
Tucker Westmore is the key to everything.
You didn't hear that from me.
I'm leaving you.
If it appears to the court like you're the one who abandoned your home, it may negatively impact your settlement.
All I need is the new passcode for the gate.
That's pretty.
My necklace?
Evelyn? How did you get in?
Oh, I hope you don't mind, but James will be spending the night here.
You know, this would go a lot faster if you just helped me.
Push with your legs. See? Helping.
I'm sure I'll regret asking, but what's all this about?
I'm dividing the house in half.
Now that I'm back, establishing distinct personal spheres seems the best way to avoid each other until it's all final.
I see. And which side of Berlin do you intend to live in?
I'll take the West wing, you the East, and the study shall be divided fairly down the middle.
I still don't understand how you got back in here.
How did you get past the gate?
I changed the code.
She climbed over the fence.
I'd sooner believe she jumped the fence on a red-white-and-blue motorcycle.
[Cellphone vibrates]
[Laughs]
I'm sorry. It's... It's just a text from James, the reverend.
My boyfriend.
I'm getting a drink.
Nah, unh-unh! You stay on your side.
You must be joking.
I am not.
You may not travel past the CÃ©zanne without risking life and limb.
Moreover, we will not speak to each other directly... only through Carmen.
So, we're gonna run our conversations through Carmen and her English-language meat grinder?
Dude, I'm standing right here.
Didn't understand a word of that.
Evelyn, the bar is on your side.
What do I do when I need a drink?
Carmen. [Snaps fingers] Please answer.
We made you a nice bar over there.
Carmen, please tell Evelyn that she cannot hold my best bourbon hostage.
Carmen, tell Adrian I will do whatever the hell I please.
She's lucky I haven't already called the police...
I'll have him brought up on charges...
Bah!
Mr. Powell says I get a raise.
Mrs. Powell says it's time for a break.
Bye-bye.
Wait. You think Kyle and Frances are in a cult?
I followed Miss Shannon to their house, and you always said there was something weird about them.
Look, I know Kyle pretty well, and if he were in a cult, I would know.
Like he knows you're a maid pretending to be rich?
I'm just saying he could be dangerous.
You shouldn't be dating him.
I'm one step ahead of you.
I'm so ready to break up with him.
Really?
Have you ever been in bed with a super-hot guy but find yourself thinking about an... older, balder... plumper gentleman?
Aye.
Who is this gross old man you're fantasizing about?
Nobody. And it wasn't a fantasy.
It was more like a terrifying nightmare that will haunt me forever.
Hey, girls. What did we miss?
Nothing.
Rosie was just filling me in on Peri's murder.
I found out what Peri was hiding, and it's big enough that someone might have killed her for it.
Sounds like you're getting close.
Spence must be happy.
Not after he hears the secret. He's not Tucker's father.
[Gasps] 
.
Oh, my God.
You can't tell him that.
Rosie, are you sure?
They did a blood test at the hospital.
Spence is not the father.
[Laughing] Wow! It's like an episode of "Maury" right here at this table.
B-But it's sad.
Poor Spence.
I think Tucker's real father killed Peri to keep this from coming out, and maybe Spence knows who she cheated with.
I have to ask him.
Aw, but you'll break his heart.
Aye. After everything he's been through, now to find this out?
Mm.
Rosie, I wouldn't want to be in your shoes.
Or Marisol's. Those are just... ugly.
I know you said Ben is out of town, but when is he coming back?
His work in Kuala Lumpur is going better than expected, so I've ordered him to stay... permanently.
But Ben is my manager.
How is he gonna manage me from there?
His work is wherever I say it is.
And Ben is a loyal follower who doesn't ask questions of me.
But Ben promised The Circle would make me a star just like Peri.
And we will, even without him.
We're very well connected.
When Peri was killed, you said Spence did it, and I never questioned that.
Well, that's the truth.
Shannon, what are you getting at?
Just that I've been very loyal to The Circle, but my loyalty comes with expectations.
I understand.
I assure you you're gonna be a bigger star than Peri ever was, and that's a solemn promise.
Really?
Have faith, my child.
All in due time.
Hi.
You left something at my house the other night.
Really? Come in. What'd I leave?
[Door closes]
Oh!
That's where those were! Ha!
How do you leave without noticing you're not wearing underwear?
I guess my... mind was on other things.
[Sighs] No. Jesse.
We can't do this again.
Why not?
Come on.
Look.
What happened between us was a mistake.
Peter's coming back tomorrow, and... and I need to figure out where we stand.
I thought you were in a fight with him.
I am.
But we didn't break up exactly.
We...
Jesse.
What?
This is wrong.
We've already done this once before.
Is it that much worse if we do it again?
I doubt Peter will see it that way.
Well, maybe he shouldn't have fired you off of your own movie.
That's a... good point.
And wasn't he always prioritizing work over your relationship?
Um...
Very true.
For all you know, he could be planning to break up with you... and you'll have missed out... on this... for nothing.
Mm.
You make a very compelling argument.
Oh, good. You're here.
Can we talk?
Sure. Hey, who's Fiona Gladhart?
Sorry?
I grabbed your mail.
Lot of people seem to think she lives here.
Weird, huh?
Anyway, we should talk.
About?
Well, I think you're great.
But things between us moved a little too quickly.
I mean, we started dating, and then... bam!... living together.
[Chuckling] Well, we didn't have a choice when I broke up with my mother.
You got to stop saying it like that.
The point is...
I'm just not feeling the romance between us anymore.
I totally hear you, and I agree.
You do?
Yes.
Oh!
Just because I live here, I can't take you for granted.
That's not exactly what I meant.
No. You deserve romance. I got to step up my game.
Dinners, bubble baths, flowers... whatever it takes to make you happy.
You don't have to do that.
Yes, I do.
With everything going on between my mother and me, last thing I want is for you to break up with me.
[Chuckles]
[Mumbling] Oh, God. [Giggles uneasily]
[Rapid knock on door]
Oh, hello, Mr. Powell. Is everything okay?
No, Carmen, it is not.
I finally figured out how Evelyn got on the property that night.
I played back the security footage.
She and that reverend just pulled up to the gate, punched in the code, and drove right in.
Well, mystery solved!
Goodbye.
Now, where do you suppose Evelyn got the gate code?
Maybe from one of the gardeners?
That's a lovely necklace.
You know, Evelyn has the exact same one.
She does?
Why do you have Evelyn's necklace?
I stole it.
Okay, fine.
Mrs. Powell tricked me into giving her the gate code.
She tricked you? How?
Well, by asking me for it and then offering me nice things.
Carmen!
All this time, I thought you were on Team Adrian.
I am!
Look, you wanted Mrs. Powell to move back in to the house, and she came back, so you win!
I wanted her to come back broken with her tail between her legs.
Instead, she comes back triumphant with a handsome black man between her legs.
I'm sorry.
So am I, Carmen.
You're fired!
[Door closes]
I must thank Rosie for her recommendation.
Who knew personal trainers could be so handsome?
Thank you, Mrs. Delatour.
Please, call me Genevieve.
Okay. Genevieve.
We should get to know each other better.
Would you like to join me for a light dinner and some heavy petting?
Oh. Uh, wow. Um...
I don't think that's a good idea.
Because I'm a few years older than you?
Are you older than me?
[Chuckling] Oh, Jesse.
It's just, I like to keep my client relationships professional.
I could fire you.
Oh, please don't.
Uh, truth is, you don't want to get mixed up with someone like me.
My love life is a complete mess.
Shoulder press.
Tuck those in.
And one...
Are you seeing someone?
I was seeing this one girl, but she went out of town, and then I kind of slept with my ex.
Ah. An ex?
Well, I suppose I can understand the appeal of the one who got away.
So you get it?
Yes.
In the meantime, I am paying excellent money for these sessions, so while you're spotting me, maybe your hands could... slip a little?
[Gasps] Oh, Carmen. Good.
James wants me to send him something, but I have no idea what it is.
Dear, are you familiar with this word?
Selfie?
Mm.
Uh, that's when you take a picture of yourself like this.
[Camera shutter clicks]
[Gasps] Ooh! That's fabulous.
Yeah, you have to admit, I'm pretty handy to have around, huh?
Indeed.
And now that you and Mr. Powell are separated, I-I don't feel right cleaning for him.
Us girls, we have to stick together, right?
Adrian fired you, didn't he?
But now I can focus all my energy on cleaning for you.
I work for Marisol's maid service.
I could actually hire a good maid... if there is such a thing.
Listen, lady, the only reason Mr. Powell fired me is because I helped you.
You owe me.
Do I, though?
Come on. Mr. Powell hates me now.
So having me around would drive him crazy.
Don't you think?
I'm so glad you agreed to meet me.
Of course.
I'm just surprised it's during lunch.
You usually reserve this for business.
Oh. When I was in New York, all I could think about was how much you mean to me and how badly I screwed things up.
Well [scoffs] we all make mistakes.
I am so sorry for what happened with your movie.
I...can't even imagine how hurt you must've been.
Peter, it means so much to hear you say that.
And another thing...
I know I've been way too focused on work, but that's about to change.
It is?
Look, I really want to make this up to you, so, next week, I've canceled all my meetings in the hopes of escaping with you to Hawaii.
[Chuckling] Oh, my God.
You mean the world to me.
I don't want anything to come between us again.
Let's start all over... blanket forgiveness for anything that might've happened in the past.
[Glasses clink]
[Laughs]
Evelyn, I know you're not speaking to me, but it appears that the East wing is out of bourbon.
[Beep] Would you mind if I crossed to the bar for a fresh bottle?
[Beep] I'll take your silence to mean you're okay with my proposal.
[Glass shatters]
What the hell?
If I were talking to you, I'd have given you a warning.
What happened?
Carmen!
I thought I fired you.
About that...
Carmen's working for me now.
Take care of that for me, would you, dear?
There.
I see.
Well, I just hired a new maid this morning to replace you.
[Bell jingles]
[Bell jingles]
[Sighs]
Danni?
Will you take care of this, please?
You're back.
Yeah. I'm back.
[Phone ringing]
Hello?
[Buzzer]
Can I help you?
Oh.
Hi, uh...
I was just looking for a pen to sign in.
Hold on. I got one in my bag.
So, back to see Westmore, huh?
Well, you two must have a lot to talk about.
I don't know about that.
Oh, I am so glad to see you.
[Chuckles] Me too.
[Door closes in distance]
What's wrong?
Is it just me, or is that guard watching us?
He's a guard. It's his job.
No, I mean, I've been thinking that someone has been spying on me.
Maybe it's that guard.
Why would he be spying on you?
[Chuckles uneasily]
I just feel like I can't say stuff to you.
I wish there was some way we could be alone together.
You mean like a conjugal visit?
Yes.
What's that?
You know. Conjugal.
Mm?
Conjugal?
You could keep saying it. I still don't know what it is.
s*x. Isn't that what you're asking me about?
Oh. Yes.
That's how we can be alone, let's do it.
Yeah, whoa. Easy. [Sighs]
It's for married couples only, and after Ernesto came back...
Our marriage was annulled.
[Sighs]
Look, I want to be with you, too.
But rules are rules.
What other choice do we have?
Just one.
Spence Westmore, will you marry me... again?
[Chuckles]
Oh!
Zoila! What a nice surprise!
Sorry for humping... bumping into you.
You look very nice today.
What? No. No, I don't.
[Scoffs]
Well, I must say, you're acting rather strangely.
I have a lot on my mind.
I'm, um, meeting Genevieve for lunch.
We're trying to be friends again.
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Maybe we could get together later for one of our little chats.
Actually, Genevieve is pretty needy, so I don't think I'll be free for... a really long time.
Okay.
Then I'll see you when I see you.
Yep. Guess I only have room for... one rich crazy person in my life.
And there she is.
Got to go.
Goodness. You're living with a man?
You don't have to sound so surprised.
Oh, sorry.
What's he like?
Kyle is a total mama's boy.
Oh. Now it makes sense.
Anyway, I've been trying to end it with him, but he's in this huge fight with his mother, and I can't kick him when he's down.
So put him back together with his mother.
It'll soften the blow when you break his heart.
Hey, I like that.
How about you? Any new men in your life?
Well, I did make a pass at my personal trainer, Jesse. He looks like the statue of David dipped in chocolate.
Jesse Morgan?
Yes. Is he your trainer, too?
Maybe he's not as good as I thought.
No, I know him through Marisol. They used to date.
Wait. I thought Marisol was seeing Peter.
No, she's still with Peter, but she used to date Jesse.
So Marisol is Jesse's ex?
Yeah, I know.
Marisol's love life is... complicated.
Yes. It certainly is.
Shannon? What are you doing here?
Well, I-I heard you were living here now, and I need to talk to you.
Oh! Are those for me?
Why would they be for you? I didn't even know you were coming.
Oh. Right.
[Chuckles]
Look, those are for my girlfriend.
She doesn't know about The Circle. I'd like to keep it that way.
Have you talked to Ben?
Mother said she sent him to Malaysia, but...
Malaysia?
She claims she's expanding The Circle, but I don't buy it.
Well, I don't know what's going on.
But I'm done with Mother... The Circle, too.
What do you mean you're done?
All Mother cares about is herself.
That's what The Circle is really about, manipulating everyone into worshiping her.
But she made me a promise, to turn me into a star like Peri.
The Circle didn't make Peri famous. She made that happen herself.
Hate to break it to you, Shannon.
You've been played.
All right, kids. Let's get this show on the road.
I've got to give last rites to an inmate in solitary.
Could we have a minute, please?
Sure.
Does that guard have to be here?
Forget about the guard.
Look, Rosie, I want this conjugal visit, too, but it's not really a reason to get married.
Stop.
This isn't just about us getting to be alone together.
I love you, and I still think of you as my husband.
But you're gonna be married to a prisoner.
I don't care.
Even with the bars and the guards, this is still the most romantic moment of my life.
Cavity search?
I hope you've been brushing, mister.
Oh, it's not that kind of cavity.
Oh.
Okay, Padre.
You're on.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join Spence and Rosie in marriage.
So, this is the honeymoon suite.
You got 30 minutes.
I'll be right outside.
[Door closes]
Do you think he'll be able to hear us in here?
That depends on how loud you plan on getting.
Mm. Wait. Hold on.
I really need to tell you something.
No, no. No, me first.
Spence, I...
Just listen.
You marrying me again... you've given me hope.
And just knowing that I have you and Miguel and Tucker...
Yes, Tucker...
Has given me the strength to... to go on.
You're my family, all of you.
I see.
Your turn. What did you want to say to me?
Um... I... I... I want you so bad.
So, listen, Danni's back in town.
What?
Yeah, I was wondering what I should tell her... about you and me.
Don't tell her anything. No one needs to know.
Really?
Yeah.
We don't want to hurt Danni... or Peter.
You saw him. Yeah.
And he told me everything I wanted to hear.
Oh. Look...
What happened between us... it was a one-time thing.
Okay, it was a two-time thing, but it was only because we were both missing the people that we're supposed to be with.
I'm pretty sure that's your guilt talking.
Come on. Danni just... makes more sense for you.
'Cause she's younger?
Yeah!
Younger is better. Society says so.
Yeah, I just don't think I could lie to her.
Sure you can. It's easy.
[Knock on door]
Danni.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming back?
Why would I tell you anything?
I'm nothing to you.
I don't blame you for being mad, okay?
And I'm sorry about the way we left things.
I found my dad.
What?
His name is Lucas.
You went to school together.
But h-how did you...
It... It doesn't matter.
I found out a lot of things.
I know you were in love with him.
Everyone thought you would get married.
Did you speak to him?
How is he?
He's dead.
Oh, my God.
Lucas never knew he had a daughter.
And because of you, I'll never know him.
Danni, I was so youn...
No.
You don't get to talk.
You didn't just ruin my life. You ruined his, too.
I was wrong. I-I made a mistake.
Well, I don't forgive you.
And from now on, you're nothing to me.
[Door closes]
âª âª
Oh, my God! You got remarried!
I'm sorry I didn't invite you, but I wasn't allowed any guests... or sharp objects.
[Chuckling] Well, congratulations.
Sweetie, you don't seem happy.
I mean, I know Spence is in jail.
It's not that.
I couldn't tell Spence the truth about Tucker.
I realized it was going to break his heart.
Well, you'll tell him one day.
He doesn't need to know right now, especially when his life is so hard.
But if I don't find out who Peri was having an affair with, Spence might be in there forever.
Well, what are the chances that Spence knows anyway?
I mean, who tells their husband they're cheating?
[Sighs] I guess you're right.
That's more the kind of thing you confide in a girlfriend or... family member.
Like a sister.
So... how was Puerto Rico?
Hot and loud.
Like me.
Have you talked to Carmen yet?
Why do you have to bring up that bitch?
Whoa.
Uh, she's made some mistakes, but she's not a bad person.
Listen.
If we're gonna be together, you always have to be on my side.
We should be able to say anything to each other.
Uh, in that case... there's something I should tell you.
I slept with someone while you were gone.
Oh, that's it. [Chuckles]
I thought it was gonna be something bad.
That's not bad?
[Chuckles] No!
While I was home, I slept with people, too.
People? Like plural?
We never said we were exclusive.
That's not what this is, right?
Right.
Hmm.
[Door opens]
Peter, darling. How are you?
Sorry, she slipped right past me.
Aw, it's not your fault.
I'm so thin I'm practically invisible.
Want me to call security?
That's all right, Derek. Thank you.
What's on your mind, Genevieve?
[Door closes]
I never apologized for that childish feud I had with Marisol, fighting for your affections.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
I appreciate that. Thank you.
So, if you ever need a friend or a shoulder to cry on, I'm here.
Why would I need a shoulder to cry on?
Well, a little birdie told me that Marisol got back together with Jesse, her ex.
[Chuckles] Your little birdie is mistaken.
Marisol and I are still together.
Oh, dear.
I hope I haven't upset the applecart.
Really?
Because I think you're spreading lies in a misguided attempt to reconcile with me.
I just don't want to see you get hurt.
I think you should leave.
Well, it's sweet how much you trust Marisol.
If it were me, I'd be a lot more suspicious.
Oh! It's you.
I didn't think you were home.
I was up in the attic. What do you want?
I want to break up with Kyle.
Come in.
Wow!
I didn't know you were such a... big fan of candles.
Is that a... religious thing?
No, I just like the way they smell.
Look, we both have the same goal... to get Kyle to move back here.
The problem is he's still angry because you never accepted me.
You want him back, you need to pretend like you've come around.
So you're proposing an unholy alliance?
Just until I dump him.
How do I tell Kyle anything?
He won't even speak to me.
What if something bad happened to you?
We can create a crisis, get his attention.
Like what?
How about a financial emergency?
[Chuckles] That's ridiculous. We're very well off.
Maybe an illness? You could break a hip?
What am I, 100 years old?
I could break your hip.
That's a tad extreme.
Well, I don't hear any ideas coming from you.
Well...
Do you like those curtains?
Not particularly. Why?
Are you insane?! Oh, my God!
Looks like a crisis to me.
Mother.
Kyle! I was so scared!
It's okay. I'm here now.
Zoila? What happened?
She saved my life. I-I was upstairs napping when one of the curtains caught fire.
I spotted the flames through the window and called 911.
I'm so happy my son found such a wonderful woman.
Really?
You think Zoila's wonderful?
We finally have your mother's blessing.
Kyle, this scare has put everything into perspective.
Life is just too short to hold on to silly grudges.
She's right.
Imagine if your mom had been hurt and you were still fighting.
You'd feel awful.
I guess you're right.
You know, Kyle, maybe you should move back home.
No.
I couldn't do that to Zoila.
Oh, sure you could.
Besides, not being roommates could bring back some of that romance we've been missing.
Okay.
If that's what you want.
There's no structural damage down here, but we'd like to check the attic.
No. You don't have to do that.
Oh, it's not trouble at all, ma'am.
It's standard procedure.
[Chuckles] We'll be fine.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
I'll check the attic out myself. Thanks for being so thorough.
Ms. Shannon?
Rosie.
Are you okay?
Why are you burning this book?
'Cause I don't need it anymore.
You knew.
Excuse me?
About Spence not being Tucker's father.
That's why you didn't want Spence to give blood for Tucker's surgery.
This is none of your business.
It is my business!
Spence is in jail while another man should be.
Ms. Shannon.
I know you two weren't close, but your sister was murdered.
Your sister.
Why should I care about Peri?!
All she ever did was rub her success in my face.
I'm sorry.
But hiding the truth won't change that.
I know about The Circle.
I think they framed Spence to protect the man Peri was having an affair with.
Why would you help them cover for your sister's murder?
She wasn't having an affair.
She was raped.
What?
I came over one day and found her in tears.
Some guy had drugged her and had his way with her.
Oh, my God.
Nine months later, Tucker was born.
Who was he, the man who raped her?
She wouldn't tell me his name.
Some bigwig in the movie business.
[Sighs]
[Footsteps on stairs] Ah!
Sorry I took so long.
Hope it was worth the wait.
Mm.
Something wrong?
You tell me.
When I left, we were in a pretty big fight.
Yeah, but we worked through [chuckling] that.
Didn't we?
But we didn't talk for awhile, and sometimes things... happen.
Peter, what are you saying?
[Sighs]
I just want to make sure we're good.
We're good.
We are really good.
That's what I thought.
Shall we? Mm.
[Sighs]
Carmen, I... [Gasps] Oh. Sorry.
I was looking for you, but you're crying.
So now I'm torn because I still need something ironed.
I'll be right there. [Sniffles]
All right.
Well, what is it?
Nothing.
Carmen, I'm pretending to be sympathetic.
The least you could do is pretend to appreciate it.
A man that I knew a long time ago, he... he died.
Oh. Well...
I'm sorry for your loss.
It's stupid. I haven't seen him in 20 years.
[Sniffles]
But it's the first man I ever loved.
Probably the only man.
I understand how you feel.
You do?
In a way.
Adrian was my first and only love.
And the night of the explosion, when I thought he'd died, I was devastated.
If you repeat this, I will throttle you.
I won't.
[Sighs]
As the house burned, I realized that the last thing I said to him was that I hated him.
Suddenly, the thought of a life without him was more than I could bear.
That must've been hard.
I think I was just afraid that I would never find anyone else.
But I was wrong.
It is hard to imagine when the loss is fresh, but you will love again.
Thanks. [Exhales sharply]
Of course it helps if your first love turns out to be a real son of a bitch.
[Chuckles]
I need you to see what you could find out about this man, the Reverend James Hamilton.
Why are you digging in to this guy?
My wife believes he's the greatest man that ever walked the Earth.
I intend to prove her wrong.
And you think he's up to no good?
He's a man of God.
There must be a few skeletons in his closet.
I need to know what he's hiding.
[Doorbell rings]
Is Peter here?
No.
But, listen, Jesse, you can't keep showing up here like this.
Just hear me out. It's important.
Okay.
[Door closes]
Look, I told Daniela I slept with someone while she was gone.
Don't worry. I didn't mention your name.
How'd she take it?
That's the weird thing. It didn't bother her at all.
Well, that should be a relief.
It's not.
If you really care about someone, it bothers you when they're with someone else.
I agree.
Just like it bothers me that you're with someone else.
Jesse.
I should have never broken up with you.
I realize that now.
What we had... that's what I want.
No. No, no.
Marisol, you have feelings for me.
You can't deny that.
Look.
[Exhales sharply]
The last thing I want to do is hurt you, but I am with Peter now. You have to accept that.
I'm sorry, Jesse.
Well...
I had to give it a shot.
[Sighs]
Bye, Marisol.
[Door closes]
[Cellphone beeps, line ringing]
[Sighs] Well?
You were right. Marisol's seeing her ex again.
Thanks.
[Cellphone beeps]
[Yells]
[Clatter]
If you keep cleaning at night like this, you're gonna make me look bad. [Chuckles]
You just stay on your side, and I'll stay on mine.
Danni.
I know you don't want to talk to me, but there are some things that I need to tell you.
Like what?
Your father, Lucas.
He was the best man I ever knew, and I loved him so much.
And I know he would have married me if I told him that I was pregnant.
Then why didn't you tell him?
Because I wanted to be a star.
And I knew that having a husband and a baby was gonna make it harder for me.
Giving you up was the right thing, Danni.
And I know it was selfish, but... it's what I did.
Great.
Now I know. Is that it?
Here.
This belonged to your father.
I know he would have loved for you to have it.
Thanks.
Lucas? It's me.
Listen, I don't think you should come here.
Sorry. I tried.
But Carmen doesn't want to see you.
So? Everything okay up here?
Yeah, I don't see any damage.
Oh, good.
I'm so glad you're home to help me with these sorts of things.
I admit...
I was lost without you.
The Circle just didn't feel complete.
About The Circle...
I'm not gonna be involved anymore.
Kyle, I'm sorry, but you're already involved more than you know.
You see, there's something else I need you to take care of.
Ben?
Be a good boy and get rid of this for me, okay?
Rosie, that's horrible.
I know, but I think the man who raped Peri could be the killer.
But you don't know who he is.
That's why I still need to find the video of Peri confessing her secret.
Maybe she said who the man was.
Well, I noticed Kyle and his mom being really secretive about the attic.
It's like they don't want anybody up there.
Maybe that's where the cult meets... and where they keep the videos.
So, maybe I can drum up some reason to sneak in there and snoop around.
We're going to get Spence out of jail. I can feel it.
[Door opens]
Sorry, I got to call you back.
Hello?
Ooh! Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
I'm Fiona.
Fiona!
Oh, my God! I thought you were... in Italy.
Well, I'm back early.
You must be Zoila, my maid.
