(explosion)
And deputy marshal of Dodge City Wyatt Earp has discovered that with more money comes more corruption.
So the lawman turns in his badge and heads further west to a new opportunity in a town called Tombstone.
Meanwhile in Missouri, after three years in hiding, notorious outlaw Jesse James reemerges...
I want everybody's attention, and I want it now!
: 
In New Mexico, Billy the Kid has been on a murderous rampage.
But when the law finally catches up to him...
: 
Billy will have to plan his next move... from behind bars.
(theme song playing)
You really kill 21 men?
Don't believe everything you read in the paper.
You know, I was never a criminal until the law made me one.
I had a reason for every man I killed.
How many reasons did you have?
Twenty-one.
: 
As news of Brady's murder spreads, it only adds to the West's violent reputation.
: 
Everybody's saying in order to transact business, we need to put clamps on all this lawlessness.
: 
: 
Billy the Kid is the only one charged with any crime and that's because the territory was determined to get rid of him.
He was bad for business. He's just too reckless.
: 
But New Mexico's infamous outlaw isn't ready to give in just yet.
Lunchtime, Billy.
Cold grits, just how you like 'em.
: 
 with two deputies.
One was a nice man named Deputy Bell.
And Billy hated him.
Not so tough anymore.
Enjoy the gruel.
: 
"How can I get out of this?"
He was not going to hang easily.
Damn.
A little help?
What, you want me to feed ya?
Unless you got a better idea.
Stand up.
Yes, Deputy.
I'm taking this shackle off. Once you're done eatin', it goes right back on.
You got five minutes.
Hey, Deputy?
Ah!
Bell.
Bell, don't.
: 
: 
 but he literally had no problem killing anybody.
: 
Four hundred miles away... former lawman Wyatt Earp has moved on from the corrupt town of Dodge City... and is looking to strike it rich in one of the biggest new boomtowns in the West...
Tombstone, Arizona.
: 
 because silver had been discovered there.
 suddenly you had a town.
Tombstone was the absolutely typical boomtown.
The usual things that come along with it... the gambling, the prostitution, but also a lot of legitimate businesses.
To Tombstone.
To Tombstone.
: 
But the Earps quickly discover that the best mining land has already been claimed.
After traveling nearly 900 miles to seek out his fortune, Wyatt's prospects are growing dim.
But the boomtown has a new problem, and Wyatt may be the perfect man to solve it.
: 
But it was hard to get there.
There was not a train that came to town.
You had to go from train to stagecoach or wagon.
: 
: 
 sitting right there with a shotgun ready to take on whoever there was.
Sometimes there were deaths.
: 
: 
 because of his background in the Kansas cow towns.
And he could read the warning signs before they came.
So it just happened to be the perfect storm when he came to Tombstone.
: 
: 
 he's remarkably effective.
He trails killers, he makes numerous arrests.
Wyatt took that law enforcement responsibility very seriously.
: 
When a robbery, such as the spectacular robbery of a stagecoach going from Benson to Tombstone occurred, it was really a big deal.
: 
Looks like there were three of them.
Maybe more.
They didn't even get a shot off.
Who do you think did it?
I don't know... but I know who probably does.
: 
 that was gonna be used for currency in Tombstone.
: 
The Cochise Cowboys are made up of nearly 300 cattle rustlers, smugglers and bandits spread out across the Arizona territory who have developed a notorious reputation across the country.
: 
They were a pretty bad lot.
: 
Ike Clanton's a one-man riot.
Not a man you wanted to offend.
There better be a good reason I'm here.
It all depends on you, Ike.
There was a stagecoach robbery a few days back.
Judging by the tracks, I'd say there were three men.
You think I did it?
No. Wells Fargo is offering a $3,600 reward for their arrest.
You give me the three names, I'll give you the $3,600.
If anyone were to find out... and I mean anyone...
No one will find out.
I give you my word.
Leonard, Head, and Crane.
: 
Four hundred miles away...
Lincoln County Sheriff Pat Garrett is about to begin a manhunt of his own.
Where the hell did Billy get the guns?
: 
 one reaction is tremendous anger.
Pat Garrett knew Billy was ruthless and would stop at nothing to escape.
I think he felt like he was partly responsible for those murders.
: 
 of Lincoln County?
Because you're a popular man?
Some kind of great success?
People of Lincoln County didn't elect you, Sheriff...
I did.
I found him once, I'll find him again.
Try not to lose him this time.
Trust me, I won't.
: 
And this time Pat Garrett's not taking any chances, because he's not out to arrest Billy, he's out to kill him.
: 
: 
These guys go into retirement, they need a little money, and they're like, "Oh, one more job."
That is Jesse James.
The train's gonna come around a nice tight bend, then it goes up a ridge, which is nice, 'cause it's gotta slow down considerable right here.
That's gonna give us the time we need.
: 
There's something about Charley Ford that Jesse liked.
I don't know what it was.
And Charley Ford liked Jesse.
: 
I think a certain loyalty was probably built into a lot of relationships, 
You stay in your seats, and you will have a nice story to tell your friends.
: 
What did I tell you about bringing strangers around here?
This is my brother Robert, the one I told you about.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
How old are you?
Twenty, nearly twenty.
How many men you killed?
I'm asking you, not your brother.
None.
I got no use for him.
Jesse, he's my brother.
I-I trust him more than anyone I know.
We're low on whiskey.
Did you hear what I just said?
Jesse needs an extra man because he has a bank robbery planned in Platte City.
 who's Charley's brother, 'cause Jesse liked Charley Ford, and I'm sure that Charley vouched for Bob.
: 
Over a thousand miles to the west, one man continues to crack down on crime in his town.
For the past four months, Wyatt Earp and his brothers Virgil and Morgan have been on the hunt for three outlaws involved in a deadly stagecoach robbery.
But to catch the men, Wyatt has brought in more muscle...
Two for me, Wyatt.
Oh, boy.
My heart's broken.
: 
They had been friends for a long time.
So Doc turns up in Tombstone as well and was very close to the Earps.
: 
But before Wyatt can take them down, the three suspects turn up dead.
: 
 only the perpetrators got caught in another showdown 
: 
All right, boys, poker's the game.
$10 to get in.
What can I do ya for, Morgan?
All right, I'll take two.
Damn it, I fold.
Surprise, surprise.
We need to talk.
What do you want?
I gave you three names.
I want my $3,600.
The $3,600 was for the reward.
The three names you gave me wound up dead.
I took a big risk giving up those names.
I know you did.
If I had the money, I'd give it to you.
But I don't.
That's not my problem.
It's not mine, either.
I told you don't cross me!
I heard you the first time.
I think we both know you're not gonna do a damn thing about it.
Get the hell outta here.
: 
And he was afraid that if anybody knew that he had this deal with Wyatt Earp, his name would be mud, 
: 
Shall we resume, boys?
: 
Following the death of Crazy Horse at the hands of the U.S. Army, Sitting Bull is one of the few remaining leaders of the Lakota.
And now, after a brutal winter, his people are facing a crisis.
Sitting Bull realizes he has no choice but to lead his people back to America and agree to live on the reservation.
: 
Any respectful man who loves his wife and his children, that's what they're gonna do.
: 
: 
 not that he liked it, but there was a certain acceptance, I guess.
 that was living the last part of their life on a reservation...
I don't know how anyone could've been happy.
: 
In 1885, Sitting Bull leaves his reservation to join buffalo hunter...
Bill Cody's famous Wild West Show.
: 
It was kind of a combination of a rodeo and performances.
And one of the very savvy things that Buffalo Bill did was that he would bring 
It was wildly popular in the 1880s and 1890s in the United States.
: 
There seems to have been a couple of reasons for this.
 they're being exposed to these tremendous efforts to Americanize them, right?
The Wild West Show is one of the few ways that they can actually maintain at least a fragment of traditional culture and demonstrate their skill as horsemen 
: 
My name is Jesse James, and I trust you know who I am.
: 
But his actions are gaining more attention than ever.
: 
 it's not good when people call your state the Robber State.
That doesn't recruit land buyers.
It's a stain on your state.
So they want to get beyond that.
: 
You wanna explain to me what in the hell took you so long?
We came as quick as we could.
Anybody see you?
No. No... no one.
Sit down.
: 
And he knows if he's going to stay away from the law, he needs to keep his two newest gang members close to him.
Jesse was the most paranoid of any of the gang members.
 and you can't really blame him.
All right, this bounty that's on my head, it's now on all of our heads.
You understand what I'm sayin'?
I understand.
Yeah.
: 
(patrons chattering)
: 
He never, ever for a second thought he was gonna be caught.
And if he was caught, what would he do?
He would escape, because he was always escaping.
 and, you know, he's 20 years old.
I mean, he's got that sense of immortality.
: 
"Billy, Pat Garrett is a different kind of sheriff.
He is not going to stop hunting you.
You can flee now, go to Mexico.
Nobody's gonna look for you in Mexico.
Get out of the territory."
: 
The killing of two deputies changes everything, and Garrett engages in a massive manhunt for Billy the Kid.
: 
Stay here. I'm gonna go look around.
You know, for the average citizen, Billy the Kid is very horrifying...
I mean, that he's on the loose, 
: 
 but he's also deadly, and he can just turn on a dime.
Qu√© es?
Who's there?
: 
But in death, a kid from New York City becomes a legend of the American West.
: 
He was a kid caught up in something that he couldn't control, without any deeper ambition than just to survive in this jungle.
: 
And the way he responded was sensational.
And then the way he died made him legendary.
: 
There are books written about him.
He became what he did because he embodies the idea of freedom.
: 
 it was always the David against the Goliath that was the most exciting.
Here was this very small, you know, unassuming kid.
But if you tried to take advantage of him, you'd pay for it.
: 
But while one ruthless outlaw may be gone, the violence in the West is far from over.
: 
You're a dead man, Earp!
Wyatt!
You're a dead man!
: 
So he walked around that morning pretty much letting everybody know 
Virgil!
Morgan!
You're dead men!
: 
It's Ike. He's in town.
Wyatt, he's drunker than hell.
Going around telling everyone he's coming to kill you 
Where's he at?
Last place I saw him was over on Fremont.
Does he have anyone else with him?
Four, maybe five guys.
: 
And it was brewing, you could feel it.
You knew something was gonna happen.
You knew something was going down that day.
: 
What do you want to do, Wyatt?
Go get me Doc Holliday.
Yes, sir.
: 
The Earps make the decision to walk down there and confront these guys.
You have to be willing to meet any challenge to your honor with violence, 
: 
: The sight of the three Earp brothers and Doc Holliday marching down the dusty streets of Tombstone 
 is burned into our mythology.
Give us your guns.
(clicks)
Throw up your hands.
I'm not gonna ask again.
