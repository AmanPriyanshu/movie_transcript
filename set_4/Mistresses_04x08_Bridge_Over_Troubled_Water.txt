Karen, Vivian is 4 months old, and you've already had three nannies who haven't worked out?
Who are you waiting for? Mary Poppins?
Previously on "Mistresses"...
Hi, I'm Josselyn Carver, and I'm in public relations, and I honestly think I could have you on the cover of Rolling Stone in a year.
Your show was amazing. You're basically famous.
Your face was on billboards.
Really?
: Oh, Mom, you have a drinking problem, and the fact that you still don't see that...
I can't see what isn't there.
So, how'd it go with Joss and Harry?
They're totally cool with it.
Huh.
They understand.
A car crash?
What happened? Is she okay?
Look at that. Five minutes to spare, and I'd say the place looks pretty Grandma-ready.
Don't you think?
You're sure she's okay?
Well, she's a little banged up.
She broke her wrist?
Well, her arm.
But she's tough. She'll heal.
What about her car?
Does she have to get a new one?
Maybe.
Were there people in the other car...
Hey. Luce, Luce.
Relax. Take a breath here.
[Sighs]
Everything's gonna be okay.
Your mom's taking your grandma to the best doctor in California, and I bet you she'll be back at those weekly golf games of hers in no time.
Okay, but did you put extra pillows on her bed?
[Car doors close]
Of course I did.
I'll just go double-check.
Okay.
And Lucy is already talking about law school.
Oh, it's been too long since I've seen that sweet face!
Hey, Marjorie! So good to see you again.
Mwah! Let me get your bags for you.
We made up our bedroom for you, and we don't want to hear any arguments about it.
Well, where else would you have me sleep? On the floor?
[Laughter]
Mom. Marc was just being nice.
Just so you know, I wasn't drinking during the car accident, so I don't want to hear any of your AA crap while I'm here. You got it?
[Laughter]
Aww. We're just so glad that you're here.
I'm just gonna check on some pillows.
Okay, so, I'm on the debate team now.
No! You are? Yes! Because of you!
Oh, I can't wait. You're gonna win.
Well, of course I will. I'll coach you.
[Laughing] Yes!
[Sighs]
I need to talk to you.
I mean, seriously, how am I still on hold?
Okay, I've binge-watched "Catastrophe" and ordered a birthday cake from Paris in the time it's taken Variety to ignore my call.
Okay, but you're gonna want to hang up, because you have to see this.
Seriously, if it's another one of your must-see Vimeo stars, I can't even.
No, it's not. It's one of our clients.
And, um, she won't stop tweeting, and she sounds insane.
Please tell me it's not Stacey North.
Come on.
"He's a demon in disguise. I'm gonna burn him alive, destroy him and his wife."
Who's she talking about?
I'm not sure.
Apparently, it's some married A-lister, and that's why it's going viral.
No, she sounds like a crazy person!
And not in an amusing Kanye sort of way.
Where the hell's her dad/manager?
Not sure. Tried calling.
He's not answering, and neither is Stacey.
Okay, well...
I mean, you're in charge of the social media crap.
Can't you figure out a way to shut down her account or something?
We need to stop this, or it's gonna destroy her career.
Okay.
And mine.
I just... I can't relax.
[Camera shutter clicking]
It's not a natural... I don't...
You know, if you want to get into the headshot business, maybe you should hire a real actor, you know?
Or a model! Hire a model.
[Giggles] You're just as handsome.
Besides, I think it's finally time that you updated your website photo.
I look adorable in that photo.
You look like an intern from "Grey's Anatomy."
Mm.
Mmm.
[Cellphone buzzes, chimes]
Who's that?
Oh, just... Just Harry.
So, you hungry?
I packed us an amazing cheese platter.
Hold on there, Missy. Why are you acting all weird?
And why didn't you answer that?
I thought you said Harry was okay with this whole thing... You and me.
He is.
Yeah?
He is.
Mmm.
Okay, so, you know what? This is starting to feel a little bit like a diversionary tactic, you know?
If he and Joss aren't okay with us, then we kind of...
Well... I don't actually know how they feel. I haven't told them.
I tried to. I swear.
What exactly are you waiting for?
It's all kinds of tense in that house right now.
They were about to get married in Vegas, and then they didn't, and who knows what the story is.
Wow.
Really?
I know.
It can't be good, right?
I just want the dust to settle, and then, I promise... I will tell.
Really?
Yes.
I'm not letting you get away that easy.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Where's that cheese?
Mm!
[Door opens]
[Sighs]
Hey. What are you doing here?
I had to get away from the office.
Phones are ringing. A client went off the rails.
It's not been a good morning, Harry.
Wow. Sorry.
I mean, if I had known that Stacey North was gonna torpedo her whole career, I really wouldn't have worked this hard to get her.
You know, sometimes it feels like this job is more like babysitting than actual work.
Well, why don't you just... I don't know... let her go?
Hey, can you pass me that cloth behind you?
Um, yeah.
I... I can't just let her go.
I was rebuilding my entire client list around her.
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
Not really my, um, specialty.
How can I help?
Um, I don't think you really can.
Besides, you seem real busy shining that toy from Jonathan, so...
[Laughs]
Yeah. Sorry.
Uh, while we're on the topic of Jonathan, he's having a benefit tomorrow night for the L.A. Philharmonic, and he asked me to attend. Um...
Obviously, I wouldn't ask you to come along with me, but... just wanted to let you know.
Yeah. Okay. I appreciate it.
And you're right. I wouldn't have wanted to go.
I-I do have to go.
I'm... already in hot water.
You don't... have to work with him.
Joss, this will be my third try at a restaurant.
If this fails, that's it. I won't get another shot.
Jonathan's my best chance. And you know what?
I like working with him. We have the same vision.
[Cellphone chiming, buzzing repeatedly]
Yep. Yep. Yep. Here it comes again.
Make it stop!
It's a clean break.
So I agree with your previous doctor's opinion.
You won't need surgery.
See?
So, how long before she can use her arm again?
Actually, there's something more pressing we need to discuss.
Oh.
Marjorie, have you been feeling weak lately?
A little.
Has anybody talked to you about your test results from the E.R.?
It appears you have late-stage cirrhosis.
There must be some confusion.
I'm just feeling a little tired.
Still, I'd love to run some additional tests, maybe a biopsy to confirm exactly what stage you're at.
But this is manageable, right?
You can fix it, can't you?
Well, we can give her medication to help, but ultimately, you'll probably need a liver transplant.
Oh, my God.
How did this even happen?
Well, the major cause of this disease is excessive alcohol consumption.
So, Marjorie, how much would you say you normally drink?
Once or twice a week, perhaps.
Mom. Please. Tell the truth.
Would you please not?
It's just that, in order to become eligible for a liver donation, you'd have to refrain from drugs, alcohol...
Anything else that could make the condition worse.
Is that gonna be a problem?
No.
Not at all.
I mean, what if she can't do it?
What if it's the beginning of the end?
You can't think that way, honey.
Liver transplants are very common.
This must seem so crazy.
I'm usually complaining about my mom, not worrying about her.
Maybe this is just the wakeup call she needs.
I hope you're right, but I doubt it.
Ugh! This is all too depressing.
Give me some good news or something.
My nanny's trying to poison Vivian.
What?!
I said "good news."
Okay, I'm exaggerating.
She fed her expired carrots.
You know companies just make up those dates, right?
It's a scam to get you to keep buying.
Look, it's a small thing. I get it.
But I'm leaving my baby with her.
Karen, it's baby food. Seriously.
Well, she also decided to feed Vivian solid food for the first time without asking me.
I wanted to be the one to do that.
You have to stick with a nanny eventually.
I know.
Hey. Maybe you can come over and see what you think of her.
What am I gonna do?
Just observe and give me your opinion, as a fellow mom.
I'm sure Lydia's fine, but it'll help me to know if I'm crazy or not.
Well, we both know the answer to that one.
[Scoffs] [Bells jingle]
Well, at least they caught the cirrhosis while there's still something they can do about it.
Yeah. It's actually a good thing she got in that accident.
Plus, she's warming up to me.
Really?
Yeah, not so much.
[Laughs] Yeah, in-laws can be tough.
Joss' mum is not a fan of mine, as you can imagine.
In fact, Joss is the only in-law I ever really got along with.
Right, well, I don't plan on sleeping with Marjorie any time soon, so...
[Laughs]
Hilarious and a little disturbing.
Oh, hey! Do you have plans tomorrow night?
April gave me the night off.
Yeah, actually.
I have to go to this, uh, black-tie benefit that Jonathan's hosting.
You want to come with?
Ooh! Do I have to wear a tux?
Yeah.
Then no.
[Laughs]
So, I assume this means that Joss isn't going with you?
Uh, no.
I don't think Jonathan and she will be hanging out any time soon.
[Sighs] Man, I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with both of them.
Well, there might come a time when you're gonna have to choose a side.
Well, why should I have to do that? I mean, that does not seem fair.
It's not fair.
But life's not fair.
Hey, Stacey.
Is there anything you need?
Uh, no, thank you, Kylie.
Oh. [Sighs] You do not look good.
Are you sure you don't want some coffee or something?
No, I want these billion Twitter notifications per second to stop.
Yeah, well, the world just watched you have a meltdown 140 characters at a time.
It's not a meltdown! It's the truth!
Okay.
People need to know.
Yeah, no, I'm just... I'm... I'm not sure they do need to know.
And honestly, you're making yourself look a little crazy, and you're talking openly about having an affair.
It's causing problems.
What do you mean? What kind of problems?
Well, um, I got a call from your perfume line 20 minutes ago, and they're putting all press on hold.
Yeah, you can't really be the face of Purity and a public mistress at the same time.
Oh, my God. My dad's gonna kill me.
He worked on that deal for months.
But this is... this is why I'm trying to tell you... Here. Sit down.
[Sighs]
Mm-hmm.
So, what are we gonna do?
Okay. I'm done.
I'll deactivate my Twitter.
Good.
Um, what...
It's fine. It's prescription. It's for my nerves.
Seriously? No. That is only gonna mess with your head.
Hand it over.
Let's go.
[Sighs]
Come on.
Fine.
Promise you, it's for your own good. Now, listen.
You need to get some rest and lay low and let me fix this.
[Voice breaking] Okay.
Thank you, Joss. You're the best.
Oh!
I guess you're almost worth the money.
[Cymbal crashes] Ohh!
Shh! You're gonna wake up my mother!
I'm sorry!
This room wasn't exactly built for a bed.
[Sighs]
Anyway, how is she?
[Sighs] I can't tell.
She hasn't really said a word about anything since the doctor.
She's probably depressed.
She's never gonna stop drinking on her own.
Oh, you don't know that.
She won't even admit she has a problem.
And if she keeps drinking... she could die.
That's not gonna happen.
Look, it might take a little while for it to sink in for her, but it will.
I'm not getting my hopes up.
People really can change, April.
Even the ones you least expect.
[Pop, air hissing]
Not again!
[Groans]
[Sighs]
Oh, great.
It's your turn to pump the bed.
[Clears throat]
Mm! Perfect.
You can be my one-woman focus group.
Are you ready? Tell me.
Does this poster entice you to buy an album?
Uh, yeah... If I was 13.
Sure.
Okay.
So, remember that guy I was sort of... seeing?
Taco guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's... That's the one.
I've been meaning to ask you about him, but I didn't want to be pushy, you know?
Which is hard, because I love being pushy.
[Both laugh]
How's it going?
I... I think there could be something real there.
Nice! Yeah?
How's the s*x?
Oh. Sorry. See what I mean? Pushy.
I-It's great.
It's... It's... It's... It's just...
[Sighs] See, h...
Here's the thing, Joss.
[Cellphone chimes]
I-I'm... I'm so...
Oh. Oh. Oh. Um, oh, wait, sorry.
Can you just pause on that thought for one second?
I swear I want to hear everything, but I really need to check on something.
[Sighs]
: Oh, my God! What are you recording?!
Oh, my God!
Put those phones down!
What? Oh, my God!
What are you doing?!
[Gasps deeply]
Is that Stacey North?
Yep. That's her.
Oh, why is she licking the bagels and putting them back?
I don't know. I wish that there was some answer that I could give you to that question that made sense.
Well, don't they say that all press is good press?
Yeah. Do they really?
H-Have they ever had a client self-destruct on the Internet before?
No.
Don't judge me!
I'm better than all of you!
Oh! Make it stop. Please make it stop. Please.
Thank you.
Okay. Okay.
Yeah?
And...
What's all this?
I made breakfast.
Mmm, mmm. This looks great.
Except these pancakes are like rocks.
Lucy, don't exaggerate.
They're just vegan.
It's part of my new life plan.
Well, come on. Sit, sit!
Last night, when I was sleeping on that incredibly uncomfortable mattress, I was blessed with some clarity.
It's time for me to start taking care of myself...
Eating healthy, exercising more.
[Singsong voice] Not to mention... spending more time with my girls.
Wait... does that mean you'll be here to help me practice for my next debate?
Of course!
So, does this mean we all have to eat like you? Because...
I am just so glad that you're focusing on the positives, Marjorie.
That's the attitude.
Well, thank you.
Because I will beat this.
And if I don't get to have an occasional glass of champagne, so be it.
: Tell me what happened exactly.
My dad freaked out on me about hooking up with a married man and the perfume thing, and I had to get out of the house before I exploded.
That didn't work out so well.
Okay, um, here's what we're gonna do.
Okay, we're gonna remind your fans why they love you and show them that you're not, you know, losing your mind, that you care about people, and that you're not a homewrecker.
What, like a press-release apology?
Great. Write one up.
It's already written, but you're gonna need to do more than that, so you're volunteering at the L.A. Food Bank tomorrow.
Be there at 11:00.
Wait... the food bank? Why?
Uh, so that people can see that you're not a spoiled brat who goes around licking perfectly good food every day?
Plus, anyone who brings a canned good will get a free download of your single, so...
That's kind of genius.
I know! So don't screw it up.
I'm getting as much press there as I possibly can.
Okay? Get some sleep.
You're welcome.
[Sighs] Kids.
It's... spotless in here.
Wow.
Yeah, I guess Lydia straightened up a bit.
[Gasps] Without asking you first?
You're right. You should fire her.
Look at this, though.
Well, she straightened those up, as well.
You're not getting the real picture here.
[Sighs]
Yeah. What a disaster.
You just caught her on a good day.
Mm-hmm.
Vivian was wiped.
She fell asleep right when I put her down.
You guys need anything else?
Nope.
Nope.
Well, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
I'll bring Starbucks.
Bye, April.
Bye.
[Door opens, closes]
I think I know what's going on.
It can be scary to have someone in your house all the time.
It's a little... claustrophobic.
I'm going through it right now with my mom, but you get used to it.
It's not that. I just have a weird feeling about her.
Well, that's because you don't even know her.
Maybe if you talked to Lydia a little more, you'd feel better?
Mm. Maybe.
I don't know.
Are you hungry?
I have... leftover lasagna that apparently doesn't expire until next Tuesday.
[Motorcycle revs]
♪ I'm just messing around, around ♪

♪ And I like it, uh-huh ♪

♪ Yeah, I like it, uh-huh ♪

♪ Yeah, I like it, I like it, like it ♪
Wow.
Someone knows how to make an entrance.
How very L.A. of you.
Oh, well, you know... Car's in the shop and all.
[Giggles]
Is the benefit over?
Oh, no, it's just getting started.
I just have another engagement.
Ah.
I'm Kristen, by the way.
Yes, I know who you are. Obviously, I'm a huge fan.
I, um...
I loved "The Minutes of Our Hours."
That movie made me cry, which I don't normally like to do in public.
[Laughs]
Well, that's very sweet of you. Thank you.
I'm actually a huge fan of yours.
No, you're not.
Your show's amazing, you know.
I've watched every episode.
Wow.
I'm really glad I caught you on my way out.
Oh. This is me.
Um, hey... what cuisine are you serving at your next restaurant?
Everyone's being really hush-hush about it.
I'm dying to know.
Well, you'll just have to come and find out.
How about a private cooking class in the meantime, for me and some friends?
Oh.
They'll totally flip.
Yeah, I don't really do that kind of thing anymore.
Oh, please?
Uh...
I'll pay you, obviously.
How's 15 sound?
15...
Yeah... $15,000.
Yeah, that works.
You know what? I think I can go back in for a little longer.
I have some questions that I want to ask you.
Hello! Anybody hungry?
I got Pine and Crane... Extra pea shoots for Marjorie.
[Crash]
: Ohh!
Oh, no. What happened? What happened?
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?
Should I call an ambulance?
No. No! Shh!
I-I... I just slipped.
I'm fine.
You're drunk.
No.
I just had one drink for the pain.
Come on. Let me help you up.
Okay.
[Grunting] Come on.
Come on. Easy.
[Groans]
You understand, right?
I mean, you fell off before.
Okay.
I think it's time for bed, Marjorie.
It's not that easy, you know.
Not knowing how long you have but knowing it's not a lot.
Let's see how you deal with it if somebody tells you you're dying.
Baby!
Aha. You're up.
I was hoping you would be.
Yeah. Just working.
I'm trying to spin Stacey's Bagelgate into something good.
"Bagelgate"? I'm not familiar with that album.
However, how about you don't work?
Whoa!
Wow. You really smell like tequila.
Um, how did you get home?
You didn't ride that donor cycle, did you?
No, no. I called an Uber.
Probably shouldn't have taken that last shot, but who can say no to Dudamel, huh?
[Giggles] Obviously not you.
Hey, guess who I met tonight.
I...
Kristen Sorbonne.
Really?
Yes, and she wants to hire me for a cooking class, which, I know... it sounds like step down, but...
[Whistles] she offered me a lot of cash.
Cool.
Yeah, my... my night was really great, too.
I, uh, I hung out with Andy Cohen on the couch in my PJs.
Ate some cold leftovers.
B-Babe, I'm just trying to share...
Look, you don't have to, okay?
Harry, I'm glad that you had a good time. I am.
But maybe you should just think of your work and me like church and state.
[Sighs]
So I guess that means you don't want the extra swag bag I stole?
Yeah, no, thanks. I'm good.
Do you need anything special?
You know what?
Vivian and I can go to the market later.
Are you sure?
Yes, definitely. You should stay.
I was hoping we could get to know each other a little better.
Why don't we have lunch?
Really, I mean it.
I don't need to get to work for an hour.
Come on.
You lived in 10 countries before you were 21?
Army brat right here.
Huh!
That must have been exciting.
Eh, it's more like same base, different country, kind of hard to make friends all the time.
Oh, I can imagine.
I think that's why I get along better with babies and kids.
They're easier to talk to.
I mean, I haven't had a date in...
I can't even remember.
Come on. I don't believe that.
Yeah, it's been like... three years?
Have you tried dating online?
Maybe it's a good baby step.
Um, once, but it was kind of a disaster.
Oh. Disaster how?
I didn't really know what to write in the profile, and I hate all the pictures of myself, so I just got a bunch of Nigerian princes asking for money.
I don't think you should give up.
You're so brave. I could never do what you do.
I... I read your book.
Oh. I see.
[Vivian crying]
Oh, poor baby. I wonder why she's awake.
I can get her.
No, it's okay. You go to work.
Thanks.
It's not a bad place you've got here.
It used to belong to Grace Kelly.
Wow.
I'm a sucker for those kind of things.
Can I get you a drink?
Uh, ye... no, thanks. On the clock and all.
Are those... white strawberries?
Oh, yeah. You know what? You have to smell them.
They're from this incredible urban growhouse in Silver Lake.
[Sniffs]
Mmm.
Delicious!
Yeah. Uh, my fiancée loves them.
She's, um...
[Laughs]
Subtle.
I hope you don't think this is, like, a hired date.
Pfft! No.
My friends really are stuck in traffic.
Y-Yeah. N-N-No.
My fiancée, Joss, really does love them.
I just thought you should know because, uh, she's...
I'm making this worse, aren't I?
Yes. [Giggles]
Actually, I'm dating Jesse Darby.
The singer?
Oh. Right. Yes.
I should read People magazine more often.
[Laughs]
[Sighs]
This has been the craziest ride.
Do you know that five years ago, I was throwing a fiesta in my apartment to celebrate landing a Taco Bell commercial?
And now I'm literally turning down multi-million-dollar jobs.
It's ridiculous.
Yeah. That must be really tough.
I'm only telling you this to prepare you.
Prepare me for what?
For what's about to happen to you.
I've been seeing your name everywhere.
Ah.
I-Is this the part where you tell me that it's not as great as it seems?
Yes.
Because it's even better.
Can I give you some unsolicited advice?
Yeah. Advise away.
When it's your turn, just be sure to enjoy the ride.
There are gonna be people out there who may want to make you feel bad for it, but don't let them.
You'll regret it.
You can do this.
[Sighs]
Just remember... It's for the best.
She needs help, April.
She's not gonna like this.
It'd be weird if she did.
[Sighs]
[Indistinct talking on TV]
Do you mind turning the TV down, Mom?
[TV shuts off]
[Sighs] April, if this is about last night, I'm just mortified.
I know. We've been through this before.
But things are different now.
It's serious.
And I don't want to lose you.
I don't want to lose you, either.
Good.
Then I think we need to... get you real help.
Rehab centers?
We need to discuss options.
April, I know that it must be really difficult having me around after everything I've put you through...
That's not what this is about.
I see now, looking back, that my drinking has been the root of a lot of our problems.
I've been in denial.
I need to stop lying to the people I love, and I need to stop drinking.
[Voice breaking] Wow, Mom.
No, I want to stop...
If for nothing else, for you and Lucy.
[Chuckles]
[Sniffles] That's great.
Then let's go through these places.
We can do this.
Exactly. We can.
I know me, April.
I need my family.
And having Marc around, I think I can lean on him.
I just think that maybe you need more, like a professional.
[Voice breaking] No. I need you, April.
Because if you send me away, I'm not gonna make it.
I know it.
Okay.
Okay. We'll do it together.
No, it was all Stacey's idea.
Well, she felt awful, and she wanted to give something back, you know?
I suggested a press release, but she...
She came up with the idea.
Yes, you can quote me.
Bye-bye.
[Sighs]
Wow.
It's a pretty impressive operation you've built here.
[Stammers]
Uh, yeah, thank you.
I, um... I've worked... I've worked really hard and...
Looks like it.
How...
[Chuckles]
I'm sorry.
I'm trying really hard with the small talk, but I just... I can't seem to find any words.
What... What are you doing here, Scott?
Right, um... There's really no easy way to say this, so I'll just come right out and say it.
Uh...
I've been seeing Kate.
Your Kate. Well, you, know, Harry's Kate, actually.
What?!
Yeah.
No, I-I didn't know who she was when we started.
Um, actually, I met her at that, um...
That food truck that you turned me on to.
No, no, no.
You know...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you telling me that you're Taco Guy?
I mean, I don't even know what that means.
Oh, my God.
But, uh... there's more.
Please tell me that you're not engaged. Please?
No.
No, I ju... I just, um...
It's just that I've come to realize...
Kate's a substitute for what I really want.
If you're not happy with Harry, you shouldn't be with him.
I'm still in love with you, Joss.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I know. I know. it's crazy, right?
Yeah, you think? No, Scott, stop.
Y-You're not still in love with me...
Listen, I'm just as surprised as you are, okay.
But it makes sense, because, look, the night that Jen moved out, that's the night I met Kate.
Kate brought me back to you. That's fate.
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sure it is.
Stop. This is insane.
You realize that I'm still with Harry, right?
I know, and I know that you were supposed to marry him in Vegas, but you didn't.
So?
So that helped me realize the truth about us.
It wasn't me, Joss.
You were afraid of commitment.
And... And I... I saw a window...
No, there's... There's no window, Scott.
I promise.
There is a window.
And I'll stay here, and I'll...
I'll wait for you to see it, too.
Because I know somewhere deep down in there... there's a part of you that knows this is right.
I knew this was gonna be hard for you to process. It's a lot.
Kate said...
Kate?
What, are you... you using Kate for information?
No.
No, and I never wanted her to be in the middle of any of this, okay?
If you want, I can call her right now and I can tell her it's over.
No, no, no. Don't tell her anything, okay?
You... Just don't even go near her.
I will... I will talk to Kate.
Okay, yeah, if that's what you want.
Yes. That's what I want.
I-I-I need you to leave her alone, okay?
And... And while you're at it, I really need you to leave me alone, too.
So, I took your advice and talked to Lydia, and I'm gonna keep her.
She's just a lonely girl.
And I did think about what you said.
Maybe I was a little rash in firing some of my other nannies.
But it wasn't because of the reasons you said or the expired food or...
[Sighs]
What is it?
Every time Vivian gets attached or makes a new memory with a nanny, it drives me crazy.
I'm worried she'll...
She'll what?
She'll love them more than she loves me.
There. I said it. [Chuckles]
It's dumb. I know.
That is so not dumb. It is normal.
[Sighs]
When I was a little girl, I loved going over to my aunt's house.
We'd drink tea and tell stories and dress up in her jewelry.
But my mother, she'd sit there alone, reading her books.
I can count on one hand the number of times she said she loved me.
[Voice breaking] I don't want to be that way with Vivian.
I want her to feel loved and supported.
And I worry that I'm not capable of that.
Of course you are.
How do you know?
Because you've been that way for me whenever I've needed you.
And I have seen you with Vivian.
There is no way this little girl doesn't know how loved she is.
Come here.
[Chuckles]
I'm actually kind of busy.
I just wanted to say thank you for sticking by me.
This food-bank thing is totally working.
Stacey Feeds is trending, and my new single is number 12 on iTunes.
See? Sometimes things work out.
Even my ex wrote me about how cool it is I help the food bank.
Wait. You're talking to him again?
No, Stacey, you... You really need to make a clean break from the past.
I'll be fine.
I mean, whatever happens, at least this time I know to keep it private.
Mm.
You know what?
This is a place that really helped me, and I think that it might help you, too Just in case any of that anger comes back up, you know?
It's called Impact.
A workout class?
[Chuckles] It's way more than that.
They were there for me when I really needed strength.
Just... Just give it a chance.
You know, at the very least, you'll burn 1,000 calories.
Then I guess "Why not?"
O...kay.
Oh, B.T.dubs, can I get those pills back?
I have a friend that really needs them.
Yeah, nice try. I already flushed them.
[Sighs]
Bye, babe.
Bye.
[Door opens]
Kate. Uh, hey.
Yeah, we should probably talk.
[Humming, singing indistinctly]
Hey, you.
Hey.
Look what I got.
Oh, oh, oh.
You know what they say...
Fancy linens are the way to a man's heart.
I also got your favorite...
Almond brittle and salted ganache.
Oh! From Salt & Straw?
[Chuckles]
Wait a sec.
Why do I feel like you're buttering me up?
I'm not.
You're a terrible liar.
Come on. Out with it. What is it?
[Sighs]
My mom and I had a long talk.
Mm.
And, Marc, you should've heard her.
She opened up to me.
It's what I've been waiting for all these years.
That's great, April.
I gave her the brochures, we weighed the pros and cons, but, ultimately, we decided that... here is where she needs to be.
You know she's just playing you, right?
I know I may sound naive, but I don't think she is.
You weren't there.
She really understands the severity of the situation.
It's an act, April.
She got caught, so now she's the victim.
No. No, she is ready for help.
I know alcoholics and how manipulative they can be.
They'll do whatever it takes to survive.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Turn my back on my mother when she's begging me for help?
Did you factor me into this decision at all?
What it means for my sobriety?
Of course I did. We both did.
She actually feels like it would be helpful having you around as someone who's gone through this.
[Scoffs] So she is dragging my sobriety into this.
Isn't this what you wanted to go to school for... To help people?
I'm not qualified to help her just because I registered for classes.
You didn't even bother talking to me about this.
[Voice breaking] She's my mother.
And she's sick.
[Sighs]
I need you to give it a chance.
Fine.
Fine, I will... For you.
[Sighs] But I can promise you, this will not end well.
Hey.
So...
I know Scott's Taco Guy.
I figured.
Yeah.
I wanted to tell you so many times, Joss, but there was just never a good moment, and... and Scott wanted to do it.
No, I get it. It's...
It's hard to tell someone that you're seeing their ex-fiancé.
It is.
But I'm... I'm... I'm so happy that it's you, Joss.
I knew you'd be okay with it.
Yeah. You know... [Sighs]
Kate, I'm really glad that you're back out there dating, and it seems to be making you happy, but are you... are you sure he's the right guy?
[Laughs] Of course he is.
I said that I would stay here in L.A. to find love, and... and I have.
But you...
You're not gonna be happy with Scott.
Okay? It's not gonna last.
You just have to trust me on this, Kate.
How do you know it won't last?
Because I know Scott.
He's... He's capricious. He's hot. He's cold.
He's... still married to Jen.
He's getting a divorce.
Oh, okay. Great.
So what does that make you, then? The rebound?
Mm.
You don't know anything about our relationship.
Yeah, you're right. I don't. But it doesn't really matter, Kate, because, uh, I already told Scott that Harry and I aren't okay with it.
So you can't see him anymore.
You and Scott... Over.
[Gasps] Seriously?
Yes.
He cares about me, Joss.
We only told you out of courtesy.
It doesn't matter what you think.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay, well, why don't you just try not calling him?
Let him call you.
Okay. Sure.
Because I can tell you right now that that won't happen.
I'm sorry, Kate.
[Chuckling] Wow.
Mm. I-I-I thought Savi was the bitchy sister.
I guess I was wrong.
[Exhales slowly]
[Grunts]
[Knocks]
Do you need any help getting settled?
No, thank you. I'm almost done.
For what it's worth, I know... how hard it is to get sober.
I know you do.
That's why I'm grateful to April for supporting me through this.
Okay.
Well, if you need anything, uh, let me know.
[Sighs]
You know, I-I go to this meeting in Santa Monica, and it's actually kind of fun.
[Chuckles] As weird as it is to categorize AA as fun.
I don't think that kind of thing is for me.
Marjorie, I thought you were serious about getting better.
I am.
But I don't need you to help me.
Just like you don't help around here.
Excuse me?
You play in your little band and don't bother to contribute financially at all?
You're dragging my daughter down with you.
Okay, I thought we were turning over a new leaf here.
All that stuff you said to April about me being here...
Why should I trust you?
Do you think I don't know that you were the one that ratted me out the last time I was here?
Oh, please.
Going through my trash, showing April the empty bottles.
You're the reason that we didn't talk for a year.
Don't blame that on me.
Let me be clear.
I don't know how long I'm gonna be around, and I need to know that my girls are gonna be taken care of when I'm gone, and that does not mean leaving them in your hands.
[Door opens]
You won't be around much longer.
Trust me.
[Door closes]
We won the debate! We won!
[Gasps] We alway win.
Don't we?
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
Just, uh, like two peas in a pod.
Hey!
Okay, so, it was really easy at first, because I came in first and then Hally came in second.

Can we talk?
Stop pretending that everything is normal between us?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[Sighs]
What is going on, Joss?
Is this really all about my work and Jonathan?
[Sighing] No.
I-It's more about us.
I feel like we're moving in different directions.
As long as you're blinded by the fame and the perks and all, I just... I don't really see where I fit in.
That doesn't... It's just not fair.
You've always wanted me to chase my dreams.
Yeah, but your dreams, t-they... they're different now.
You know, they used to be about the bistro and us.
Okay, look, I have worked really hard to get here, and I know that it's turning into a crazy ride, but I'd really like you to join me on it.
And if you can't or you won't, then don't make me feel bad for enjoying it.
Okay, well, maybe it's just not a ride that I want to be on.
Well, maybe if you'd explain why, then it would help, but instead, you keep lying and you keep being distant.
And you know what... You still haven't even told me what happened that night at Calista's.
Now is not the time to talk about that.
It's never the time, though, is it?
No.
You know what? We are moving in different directions, Joss.
But it is obviously your choice, not mine.
Wh...
[Sighs]
And since there is nothing else to say, apparently...
I'm going to sleep.
