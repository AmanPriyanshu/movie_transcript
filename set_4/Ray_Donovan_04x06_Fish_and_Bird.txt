It's Geno Kovacs's most important work.
It's being auctioned at a fundraiser for the Barkley Breast Cancer Center.
A donation from my gallery to a cause I know has become important to you.
Oh, I need you to accompany me to the event.
I know it's not our usual arrangement but it is a two million dollar painting, and Vlad doesn't exactly fit in at an event like that.
I'll send a car for you at six.
You went in alone and did all this with no accomplices.
I was alone, yes, sir.
As you approached the banquet hall, you shot the guard outside?
Yeah, with my 45.
[clicks tongue]
I see.
Then you went inside through this door here, the front door.
Yeah.
With the 45.
Yeah.
So you used the 45.
Oh, now... now here...
I got the 45 in my pocket, so I have the... the semi-automatic going now.
I got... I-I got a job to do at this point, right?
So I go in and I shoot four guys.
[rolls tongue]
Just like that. Ding ding ding ding.
The fourth man's bullet wound is a rear-entry.
It came from over here.
Oh, no, no, no.
Ah.
His back was to me when I shot him, and then afterwards, he turned as he fell, you know?
Oh, he turned after you shot him and then he fell.
Yeah.
Guy comes out of prison and he goes to meet his friend and this friend says, "So, uh, how was it?"
He says, "The first day they stuck me on the third tier in a cell with Ralphie.
Big black guy.
Ralphie takes me out to the railing.
We look down.
He says, 'Either you let me f*ck you in the ass, ' says Ralphie, 'or you're going to jump 50 feet to the cement.'"
His friend said, "Did you jump?"
He said, "A little at first."
You don't seem to be taking this very seriously.
Okay, look.
This guy here, up here?
He comes in the side door.
I shoot him.
Another round from the back of the room.
Did he turn too?
No, at that time I was back there.
How'd you get back there?
I crawled on all fours under the tables.
They're looking for me, shooting the place up.
I think they even shot each other, and that may be... where the confusion is coming from, sir.
I'd write that down.
I'm not confused.
I'd make a note.
So you crawled all the way to this side of the room, shot this man from this angle, and then all the way back over to here?
And slit the woman's throat?
Yeah, I've been telling you detectives the same story over and over again for weeks.
I went in there alone and I came out of there alone.
That's the essence of it.
Simple.
Okay, thank you for telling me.
No, he's here now.
I'll tell him myself.
That was your friend, Mr. Waller.
Your father's been charged.
Mr. Belikov's being released tomorrow.
I never asked you, where did you grow up?
South Boston.
Oh, yes.
I've seen the movies.
Tough guys there.
I grew up all over the world, really.
Moscow, then boarding school in Switzerland.
Stanford.
Did you go to college?
Then what brought you to Los Angeles?
I can't imagine you wanted to become an actor or something like that, but from South Boston, how did you end up doing what you do?
Hmm.
You are in a particularly dour mood, Mr. Donovan.
When Belikov gets out, you go right back to trafficking girls, right?
My uncle had me distance myself from his dealings with Mr. Belikov, but there are a few small places the businesses overlap.
You're a pimp.

Big thieves always get pardoned, little ones punished.
What's that mean?
My uncle always says, "Only the little thieves get hanged."
You're very perceptive.
Yes, Dr. Witlin is my oncologist.
How bad is it?
I'm afraid it's a bird.
With cancer, it's either a turtle, a rabbit, or a bird.
A turtle you can easily catch, a rabbit you can chase, but a bird, once it flies away...
Sorry.
