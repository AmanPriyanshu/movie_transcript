Winner by split decision...
Alicia Mendez!
Hey, Coach.
Hi. Greg Jackson.
Uh, yeah.
I saw that fight. Really impressive. Let's talk.
Are you really gonna be that guy who lives in a motel?
This place is disgusting.
You just leave me alone.
People are worried about you.
How you doing?
Good.
Now that's a guy who lives in a motel.
Did she come back here just to work in the gym or is she expecting you to be together?
I really don't know.
Boss.
Wow, wow, wow, wow.
Get some water.
I don't want to be alone.
Do you want to stay the night?
I got to make a phone call.
: Hi.
Hey Look, I wasn't up-front with you.
I'm just gonna go back to my place, okay?
I'll call you tomorrow.
It's a two person house.
And she is making it so I can't even relax in my own home.
It's a couple days, Keith.
What if she drops anchor?
[Alarm blaring]
[Alarm off.]
[Door opens]
Ryan?
Shh.
Ryan?
What.
Where are you going?
Quiet, man. She's trying to sleep, dude.
Right.
I'll go for a run.
You sweat like a pig.
Wh... what are you doing up?
I can't sleep.
Ryan...
I haven't,***
Just, just go in there.
I'll try.
Okay.
So, where are you going?
I am going running, Keith.
Right.
You all right?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll be back in an hour.
Okay [Sniffs]

How did his mom die?
His dad.
And what did he kill her with?
A hammer.
Exactly... a f*cking hammer. Mm.
Look, I know he's your boy, but we should call the police.
Because he broke his own hand? No.
Yes!
No.
He's already stabbed someone, he's watching me sleep.
[Whispering] Shut the f*ck up.
He thinks you're his f*cking mother.
I'll deal with him.
Ryan... he's obsessed with you.
Why do you put up with him?
I'm the only person that he knows.
All right, here he is.
Um, we need...
I need to get me painkillers.
Okay.
You want to stop and get something to eat?
No, no. You sure? We can get you anything you want.
[Sighs deeply] I just want to go home.
♪ ♪
Good, good, good, good!
Nice. Nice!
Wow, Joe, you tapped early.
Nate.
Yes?
Call Jay. Ryan needs to switch to the afternoon.
Why?
'Cause Keith broke his f*cking hand or some sh1t. I don't know.
[Chuckles] Okay.
But if Jay doesn't want to switch, Ryan's got to deal.
All right, well, just talk to him, you know?
Maybe we can be reasonable for a change, God forbid.
Call him.
[Line ringing]
Hey, it's me.
Uh, listen, my morning's cleared up, so I was thinking maybe we could grab some lunch.
I haven't seen you in a couple of days.
I'd like to see you.
[Blender whirring off and on]
[Whirring]
[Whirring stops]
Sorry.
[Sighs]
I have to get out of this room.
That is a superlative idea.
You should call your sister, see what she's up to tonight.
Are you training all day again?
Mm-hmm, I am.
And...
I got you a little something-something.
Hmm?
[Chuckles]
A camera?
Yeah.
You can do something fun, you know?
Like what?
Like... go to the beach, go to Malibu, take some photos, go to a museum.
Don't be condescending.
I wasn't.
You can leave.
You don't have to be here. It's fine.
You know...
You can't make me feel guilty for doing my job even when I'm barely f*cking doing it.
And you know...
I wasn't being condescending.
I just don't know what it is that you want.
Call your sister.
Maybe go out with her, huh?
Okay, mamacita?
Adios.
[Door closes]
[Starts engine]
[Rock music blares]
Good morning. Nate looks good out there.
Yeah, huh?
Maybe he can fight. What the f*ck do I know?
I hope so, 'cause his accounting is a sh1t show.
Is it that bad?
Nothing we can't overcome.
Oh, uh... my attorney sent over the contracts to Roxanne for you to sign.
Yeah, she's got them. I'll look at 'em and sign 'em.
You have any plans to leave that hotel soon?
Uh, yeah, I'm trying to get out of there as soon as possible.  I'm looking.
You need any help, you let me know, okay?
Okay.
Jay and Ryan had to switch, so I'm gonna step out for a little while.
I'll be back soon.
All right, I'll be here. Okay.
Hey, can you shut the door, please?
So, take these when you wake up.
It hurts now.
Well... you can take one now.
Thanks.
Sorry about all this.
I know you're supposed to be at the gym today.
It's all right, I'm...
I'm going this afternoon.
[Clears throat]
Hey.
Yeah?
What were you gonna do with that hammer?
Oh, I was... that was an impulse buy.
sh1t, that was an impulse buy.
You can throw that away, if you want.
I did.
Hey.
Were you gonna hurt her?
I said were you gonna hurt her?
I don't think so.
[Sighs]
Okay.
Well, get some sleep, all right? Here you go.
Hey.
Yeah?
We're gonna have to talk about this, okay?
Didn't...
Didn't we just talk about it?
We're gonna have to talk about it some more.
Okay.
Okay.
Ryan?
Yeah?
Oh.
You gonna move out now?
No.
No. I'm not going anywhere.
[Sobs softly]
Okay.
Okay.
[Door shuts]
[Both sigh deeply, breathing heavily]
See what happens when you return phone calls?
[Chuckles]
Yeah.
Wait, where you going?
I got to...
No. Come on.
I got to go back to work.
You're still f*ckin' pissed.
I'm not pissed.
You're not happy.
Well, it's a lot to deal with.
Oh, I know.
And you're right to stay with her.
I mean, I-I get it.
But... I'm a woman, and I have some f*cking feelings about you spending the night with her.
Oh, I know, I know, but nothing happened, I told you she just... that she didn't want to be alone.
I didn't know what to do.
Right, and so now I'm jealous of a woman whose life is literally falling apart, and I just don't know why. How?
How did you f*cking put me in this position?
I didn't f*cking do this. What are you talking about?
I told you, don't feel guilty about this.
[Sarcastically] Oh, you did? Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Since you say so.
I say so.
I got to go.
Am I forgiven? [Chuckles]
Yeah.
Coming over later?
You know, I do have some documents for you to sign, so I'll bring them over.
All right. Answer your phone, all right?
I don't like to be ignored.
Bye-bye.
[Door opens, shuts]
Pick it up, let's go!
[Strained] Time?! How much time?!
Two more minutes.
10 seconds, let's go. Finish strong. Come on, Jay.
We can call Ryan and give him the belt now if you want.
Push!  Let's move!
[Grunting]
Time.
All right. All right, dial it down, let's go.
Let's go! On the mat!  Come on, Jay.
Move your ass, let's go.  Come on.
One minute. One minute of work.
Here we go.  Hard as you can.
Time, go!
Go.
[Grunting]
I need more. Come on! Work!
Oh.
[Panting]
Oh.
You're a disgrace.
Whoo!
You ready?
[Sighs]
So, I called Greg Jackson.
Yeah?
He, uh...
He wants me to go to Albuquerque.
And he said I'm really talented.
He... just sees a few things that he could help me with.
He also said he'll work with Alvey.
[Scoffs]
What?
[Clears throat] He's being nice.
I mean, he knows Alvey will never be his bitch.
What do you think I should do?
I think he's a legend.
I think it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
You got to do it.
Any downside?
No downside.
You didn't last there very long.
Yeah, but that's on me.
I mean, he's got a gym full of killers, and if you f*ck off, and you don't perform, you're out.
Next man up.
It's a good thing.
You got to tell Alvey today.
You don't want him to hear it from someone else.
You coming with me or...
Yeah, I'm not staying here by myself.

Is my phone up here?
Uh... No.
Did you lose it?
It was in my bag.
You should check the last place you left it.
[Phone chiming]
[Jay sighs]
Yo? Jay?
You seen my phone?
No.
Um, what's it look like?
Like my phone.
f*ck. You should probably get out of here.
Ryan's almost here.
I'm on the move, man.
What?
[Chuckling] What?
Good work today.
Not really, actually.
You're really f*cking out of shape.
I appreciate your honesty.
You're welcome.
f*ck.
What are you doing here?
Ryan's gonna be here, like, any second.
Fear not.  By the time he arrives, I'll be but a trail of musk.
[Scoffs]
What are ya...
What are you doing later? Hmm?
Getting my pussy waxed.
Indeed.
And after that activity?
Do you want to have...
I don't know, you want to have a drink?
You're in camp. You're not supposed to be drinking.
Lisa, I'm 160 pounds.
Weight... not an issue.
Also I have the constitution of a goddamn cast-iron skillet.
Have a drink with me.
Lisa, it'll take the edge off of this waxing process.
I know...  Lisa...
Jay.
Lisa...
I f*cking miss you.
We haven't shared a drink in over a year, and that makes Jay very sad.
Lisa, I will not let you hide yourself in this office.
No. No longer.
Okay, if I have a drink with you, am I the worst manager in the history of managers?
Well... it's not for me to judge.
I'll text you all the specifics... on your cellphone.
[Sniffles]
Hey, hey. Let me help you.
Thanks.
You out of here? Yeah.
Where you headed?
Miami.
Is that home?
Yeah.
No sh1t. You know, I'm from Tallahassee.
You ever get up there?
Never been.
You're not missing that much.
Hey, uh, you got another cigarette?
Uh... Sure.
Thanks.
So, your boyfriend... like a fitness trainer or something?
He's a fighter.
No sh1t.
Sorry to ask, do you have anything, um...
What are you looking for?
I just want to get high.
I got some blow.  It's not very good.
Did you want to share it?
Your boyfriend's not gonna come after me, is he?
We won't tell him.
[Chuckling] Okay.
[Rock music blares]
Good. Box.
Right? The head, head, head.
Head to the body! Under... hook, pump.
Get out, get out.
I want you to work him on the f*cking cage.
I want you to break him down.
I want you to break his f*cking body.
Just put him against that fence, you work his f*cking body, and get off, all right?
Yeah.
Get me in.
Come on.  Good, good, good, good.
Body, come on! Body work... good!
Work it! Come on, come on!
Come on!
Good! Take it! Take it!
Take it!
Good.
Legs. Go for a takedown.
Oh, nice!
Come on.  There he is...
[Tone chimes]
Oh!
Yes! Nice.
You see how more effective you are?
You put it all together, right?
You don't f*cking give him that space.
Don't give him that space.
Yeah.
Hey. Come on.
There's something you should know, you didn't hear it from me...
Jackson's coming for Alicia.
Wait, when?
After her fight, he came up to her.
She's listening, Coach.
Is she going?
She's going.
Okay.
Thought you should know.
Hey. Good looking out, man.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey.
Let's go.
[Rock music blaring]
[Music stops]
[Chuckles]
That's depressing.
Ava?
Um, hello.
This is Jay-Mo.
[Laughs]
Um... where are you?
Uh, I just pulled up, your car is here, but all your sh1t is gone.
Um...
Maybe you're doing laundry.
[Chuckles]
Yeah, call me back. Bye.
[Sighs]
[Rock music playing in background]
Hey. Um...
[Sighs] Do you have a second?
Sure. What's up?
Um...
Un-fucking-believable. You're leaving.
How did you know?
I'm magic.
Who is it?
Greg Jackson.
Honestly, I... I didn't look for this.
He came up to me at the fight.
Yeah, I know how it goes.
And he was being cool, you know?
He said he'd work with Alvey.
That's very generous.
Come on, man, it's Greg f*cking Jackson.
I know.  He's great.
That's why he's got John, Holly, Carlos, Cowboy, and 20 other fighters that you'll be behind.
I'll work my way up.
Yeah, one way or another, right?
Look, I know you're pissed...
Mm!
...but this is f*cking huge.
I'm not.
I can't pass this up.
I understand.
Thanks for telling me.
So, that's it?
Fighters leave all the time.
They leave Greg, too.
Yeah, well, do you think I'm making a mistake?
How the f*ck would I know?
And stop with the little girl bullshit.
You want to go, you should go.
I was just asking your opinion.
You don't get my f*cking opinion.
I'm not here to make you feel good about this.
And I don't have time for fighters who aren't on my roster.
Fine.
Oh, and you should tell Alvey after he's done with Ryan or I will.
Hey.
Hey. You're not training today?
No, I, um... Can we talk?
My office.
Hey.
[Sighs] What's up?
[Voice breaking] Okay.
You all right?
What's going on?
I'm leaving.
For who?
Greg Jackson.
You know, I f*cking hated to.
I mean, you've been awesome to me, and I f*cking... I love being here.
Well, we... I don't...
We love having you.
Come on. You know I'm a pain in the ass.
You think any of these fighters are a day at the beach?
Your mind made up?
[Sobs softly]
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Ah, it's okay.
Let me tell you something.
You think you're the first fighter to leave me?
Hmm? You know how many f*cking tough guys sat on that couch, tears in their eyes, trying to nut up, tell me they're gone?
I tell them all the same thing.
This place, my team, it's not for everyone.
Sometimes it's just not a fit, you know, that's the way it goes.
I don't feel that way about you.
I love coaching you.
I love watching you train.
You're very talented.
And you are as f*cked up as I am.
[Laughs]
[Sniffles]
But there's one f*cking thing I know.
This business will always turn its back on you, so you need people in your life that never will.
And that's what I am for you.
We're family. Okay?
My door, it's always open.
Always. Do you understand that?
Yeah?
Thank you, Coach.
Okay.
I mean, for... for everything.
I was nothing before I came here.
It's okay.
We'll miss you.
[Sobs]
You take some time in here, all right?
I'll be around all day, you want to talk to me.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You're all right.
[Sighs]
Ahhhh!
[Clears throat]
You don't give a sh1t about this fight, do you?
You know, I tried giving a sh1t once, and it just... did not feel good.
[Chuckles]
Cheers.
Cheers.
It's nice to see you drinking again.
It's really good to be back.
Been missing my jogging partner.
[Laughs]
What's going on with you?
Won two title fights, and I thought you'd be happy.
Yeah.
Well, I thought I would, too.
So, why aren't you?
Well, I thought my life would be different somehow, that things would change.
But nothing's different, you know?
Not a f*cking thing came my way.
Okay, fine, well, I'm back now.
Okay, and I can get you sponsors, but you have to keep the f*cking needle out of your arm.
Oh, I'm done with that.
You promise?
Hey.
Moving on...
Would you like to do this again?
I would like to keep them coming, yes.
Okay.
Whiskey-ginger, please.
Keep the tab open.
I think that's it.
All right, let me see.
Oh. f*cking bullshit day.
What happened?
I lost a fighter.
Oh, you missed one.
This.
Who was it?
Alicia.
Oh, sh1t.
Yeah.
I liked her.
Girl was living in her f*cking car when I met her.
Gave her everything she wanted, I gave her my f*cking time.
I was... I was gentle with her.
I took care of her, I didn't throw her out into deep water.
Now she's got a f*cking career.
Thank you, Alvey.
[Scoffs]
Yeah, that's frustrating.
What did you say to her?
Oh, I said I understood her decision, and that my door was always open.
Oh, yeah? That was nice.
Yeah. Well, anything else would be weak.
But I remember every f*cking fighter that's ever left me.
Even the ones I didn't want.
These f*cking people.
They don't know what's important.
They don't know.
You know, she stood in front of me with f*cking tears in her eyes, telling me how hard this was.
How much I've f*cking done for her.
You know, trying to make me a f*ckin' father, and now she's... now she's out the door because she's got her f*cking head turned.
Well, good f*ckin' luck, sweetheart.
She'll be f*ckin'... She'll have five kids with three different dudes before she's f*ckin' 30, get...
Alvey, Jesus, that's...
What, that's what?
I mean, that's a little harsh.
That's my f*ckin' business.
[Ringtone chiming]
[Sighs]
Hey.
: You coming or not?
What? Where?
I'm at the bar.
What? What bar?
Uh, the bar that you wanted to meet me at.
I'm here now.
I... don't know what the f*ck you're talking about.
You texted me that you wanted to meet me.
I didn't text you.
Yes, you f*cking did!
Check your phone.
Will, I didn't text you.
Oh, my God.
I'll send you the f*ckin' thread then.
You know what, Nate, you're a nice guy, but you're obviously very confused, and I don't have time for this in me life right now.
Lose my number, please.
[Scoffs]
You good to drive?
Yep. Licensed and everything.
Are you good to drive?
I'm fine to drive.
See, I'm good.
Yeah, you're good. Get going.
[Both laugh]
Thank you.
For what?
For making me feel normal tonight.
[Sighs]
Lisa, this is something that happened to you, all right?
It is not who you are.
Yeah.
I love you.
I love you.
Drive safely, okay?
You, too.
I'll be fine.
I mean it.
Yeah.
I've had to pick you up from jail a couple of times.
Drive safely.
[Start engine]
[Tires squeal]
[Slow rock song plays]
Can I get a shot of whiskey?
Are you drinking alone?
Probably so.
I was supposed to meet someone.
Didn't show up.
So, did I hear an accent?
Yeah, English.
No, United Kingdom.
[Chuckles] That's the one.
Right, yeah.
What's your name?
Will.
Can you close me out?
And put Will's drinks on my tab.
Oh, no, no, no.
Mate, I can buy me own drink, thanks anyway.
No, no, that's nonsense really.
It's... It's really nice to meet you, and I hope you enjoy your time here in these United States of America.
Cheers.
God save the Queen.
Ah, f*ck the Queen.
f*ck the Queen?
Get out of here.
f*ck the Queen.
Thanks for the drink.
Yeah, man.
[TV playing]
[Pounding on door]
[Doorbell ringing repeatedly]
Wait a second.
Hey.
Hi.
It's, uh... It's kind of late.
What are you doing here?
Uh... I wanted to see you.
Can I come in?
[Whispering] Oh, she's here.
I want to meet her.
Lisa.
I want to meet her.
[Sighs]
Come in.
Roxanne, Lisa.
Lisa...
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm gonna get my things.
No, you don't have to leave.
No, no, it's, uh... It's okay.
I know you guys have a lot to talk about, so...
I'll be in the kitchen.
She... is a drunk, so...
Yeah, well, who's not?
[Sighs] I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm gonna to talk to her and tell her to leave.
No.
Don't to that. I'm going.
Come on.
Come on, what?
What?
Good night.
[Door opens, slams]
[Sighs]
She's beautiful.
How old is she?
About my age.
Well, if she's had any work done, you can't tell.
[Chuckles]
What is it that you want?
I had a question that I wanted to ask you.
I was gonna call you from the hotel, but I thought, you know what, I want to see his face.
What is it?
Why didn't you come get me?
What does that mean, come get you?
When our baby died, why didn't you come get me?
You didn't want me to.
Are you f*cking out of your mind?
Your father called me and said you didn't want to see me.
My father?
So f*cking what?
I was respecting your wishes.
I'm dying, and you're respecting my wishes?
Did it ever occur to you that I didn't know what the f*ck I needed?
That maybe... what I needed was you?
Your father called me...
My father f*cking called?!
Who the f*ck cares?!
What about me?! My father?!
Don't... Don't do this!
Don't f*ckin' hit me! Don't f*ckin' hit me.
Okay?
Calm the f*ck down. You're drunk.
Calm down. Okay?
I'm not gonna hit you.
All right, all right.
You're hurting me.
I'm not... I'm not hurting you. I'm not hurting you.
I don't want you to hurt yourself.
I'm gonna go to bed. You're going back to your hotel.
I'm not done with you.
Would you get the f*ck out of my house, all right?
f*cking stop! f*ck! f*ck! Stop!
Stop! f*cking stop!
f*cking stop, stop!
f*cking stop! Stop!!
f*cking crazy bitch!
You're f*cking crazy!
Yeah, I'm crazy.
Stop.
I'm crazy because you made me f*ckin' crazy.
I'm not even a f*cking person anymore, I crawl around on the floor like an animal.
[Crying] You killed me.
I f*ckin' hate you.
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.
[Crying]
Okay, all right.
All right. Let me go.
Okay, okay.
Let me go.
Stop.
Shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
Okay.
Okay.
