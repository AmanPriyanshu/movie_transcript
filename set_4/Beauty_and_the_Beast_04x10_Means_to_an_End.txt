No.
You killed the deputy secretary.
Someone, somehow, is always after Vincent.
And you're enabling him.
Cat, you're breaking the law.
What if you stop covering up?
What if you stop knowing what's going on?
I want to be there for you, but I can't, unless you stop keeping secrets from me.
Vincent's working undercover for Homeland Security.
: Thank you for telling me the truth.
Someone's willing to pay $5 million to capture a beast.
There's a bounty?
Graydal Securities is the one behind the beast bounty, so that's where I'm going next.
Graydal is not just your everyday security firm.
They're like Blackwater on steroids.
Pretty ballsy move, you walking in here that way.

Okay, what's going on?
What do you mean?
: What do you mean, what do I mean?
First of all, you do not drink tea.
And secondly, you can't tell me that you're not worried.
You haven't heard from Vincent since he turned himself in to Graydal and that was, like, three days ago.
But he's fine.
Uh-huh.
And this what denial looks like.
No.
This is what realizing you can't control everything looks like.
Vincent and I made a choice, we can't go back on it, so I'm just embracing my path.
Wow.
Must be some tea.
(laughs)
Vincent didn't turn himself in on a whim.
We made a plan.
JT's got eyes on Graydal, so as soon as they deliver Vincent to the beast buyer, we'll finally figure out who it is.
Okay, so you ID him or her.
Then what?
Okay, whoever it is has been looking for a beast for months, and it can't be for anything good, right?
So once we figure it out, I will inform DHS and then they will take him down.
I still can't believe they fired you.
Not fired. Suspended.
But even if they don't take me back, hopefully us stopping whatever this beast buyer is trying to do will be enough for them to believe that Vincent isn't the bad guy that they think he is.
(humming): Om...
(chuckles)
Do not mock my Zen.
Still, I wish a tea could help me figure out whether or not I should move in with Kyle.
What? He asked?
Isn't it a little early?
Yeah. Especially 'cause I have to keep lying to him about everything.
I mean, it's easier when it's on the occasional date, you know?
But when it's over, like, breakfast and lunch and dinner...
Well, bright side?
If this plan works, then we can all stop lying.

Yeah, and her only job is to find Vincent.
How long have they been in there for?
20 minutes, give or take.
If they arrest him...
I know.
I don't.
Our only chance of showing DHS that Vincent's a good guy and not a crazed killer is before he gets caught, not after.
Otherwise, they're gonna put him on trial for murder.
I'll go make you some tea.
Since when do you drink tea?
They're coming out.
: What?
So they didn't find him.
Uh... apparently not.
(exhales happily) That's good news, right?

Put simply, although my client seems satisfied with all the tests I've run so far, he still has a few more questions.
Questions?
Come on, Braxton.
Who is this guy and what does he want from me?
You're still trying to find that out, aren't you?
Well, I can't blame you.
I'd want to know why someone was willing to pay $10 million for me, too.

Oh.

He'll let you know what the next test is.

Maybe it's to see how far we're willing to go.

Obviously, somebody's doing everything and anything they can to get Vincent to do something he doesn't want to do.

Close enough.
Important thing is we'll have remote access to the exposure tapes, and we can get the hell out of here.
And you really think this is gonna work?

It was in the bag.
Apparently, the cleaners thought it was clay.
Obviously, they did not see the detonator.
Any idea what the man behind the curtain wants to do with it?
No, not yet, but whatever it is, it can't be good.
I mean, this thing can blow up an entire building.
Okay, what are we gonna do?
Not that, obviously.
This is where we draw the line, right?
Yes, of course.
We can't kill innocent people just to cover up a secret.
Which leaves us where?
Well, I was kind of hoping you might be able to identify whoever is pulling the puppet strings.
No such luck.
Which I admit is really weird, because no matter where I look, all roads lead to Graydal.
Uh, meaning?
Meaning either I am a lousy detective and I can't find a connection...
Right.
...or there isn't one.
There's got to be a connection.
I mean, Braxton's got a contract from a client for $10 million to find me.
There's got to be a money trail, uh, case files, e-mails, something.
It just doesn't make any sense.
Unless the beast buyer doesn't exist.
Come on.
No... think about it.
Braxton is the one that caged you, he did tests on you, then he claimed to send you off to somebody else who wanted to do tests on you, too, right?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, so what if that somebody else doesn't exist?
Mm?
What if the reason I can't find a client is because there isn't one?
(sighs)
Vincent, what if Braxton is the beast buyer, and all of this is a facade to keep us from finding out?

It's JT.
He's at Graydal.

Actually, it's Braxton.

I can't believe that Braxton was behind this the whole time.
And he didn't even care that we found out it was him.
It didn't bother him one bit.
Yeah, that's because he thinks he's holding all the cards, and not just with the threat of exposure now.
I never should've let JT go in there.
I didn't know he was gonna take Heather with him.
Hey, come on, it's gonna be fine, all right?
I promise you. Braxton won't hurt them.
Yeah, unless you don't pass the next test, which is blowing up my DHS office.
But I won't do it. You know I can't.
I know, but what are we gonna do?
(sighs heavily)
You know, maybe it's about time we started using a little leverage ourselves.
Look, Agent Dylan's been trying to take down Braxton for years, right?
That's why he's trying to kill her by blowing up your office.
And setting you up to take the fall.
Yeah. You think you have enough proof to build a case against him?
Maybe. But DHS isn't gonna believe anything I found.
Yeah, but maybe he will.
Maybe we could force a confession out of him.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking we do what we were planning from the beginning-- find out who's behind this and get DHS to bust them.
All we have to do now is make DHS believe that they're... busting me.

All right, let's go!
: All right, let's go, guys.
Don't lose him!
: Let's go! Go, go, go!
: Hey... you're with me!
Come on, let's go! Keller's been spotted!
Sure taking them long enough to spot me.
: Yeah. Your tax dollars at work.
Don't worry, they'll find you.
: Ugh. They better.
You at Graydal?
Ready and waiting.
Okay, good.
Hey, don't forget about the guard just in the tunnel entrance, okay?
I won't.
And don't you forget to not get caught.
Kind of defeats the whole purpose.
(siren wailing)
Yeah, I promise.
Okay, gotta run.
: Hey!
(phone beeps off)
Keller's not answering my texts.
Probably because they're chasing him.
What do you mean?
Who's chasing him?
DHS. We just found out.
It's a full alert.
Where are they chasing him to?
I think to us.
(grunting)
(grunts)
(grunts)
(grunts)
Hey. I'd put my hands up if I were you.
(sirens approaching)
(men shouting)
: Put your weapons down!
(electronic whirring)
: Come on. Get up.
Now!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.
Wait, wait-- where are we going?
To where your friends can't help DHS to find you.
Freeze!
Cat!
Drop it, now.
I said, drop it.
You don't know what you're doing.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
So don't test me.
You think the only reason that I was testing Vincent was to see whether he'd blow up some dumb DHS office?
I didn't go through all this, I didn't spend months looking for somebody like Vincent, for that.
Let me guess, there's a bigger bad out there you're really trying to stop?
Yeah, there is.
Of course there is.
You knew Agent Dylan was getting close, that's why you blackmailed Vincent into trying to get rid of her.
You knew it was only a matter of time before she found out about all the fugitives you hired, the hit men-- Erik Lee?
Erik Lee?
He was nothing!
The only reason I forced Vincent to get him off was to set him up.
And those fugitives, those hit men?
They helped me stop bad people from doing bad things-- things FBI, DHS and even CIA wouldn't do!
That's why I created Graydal!
I don't have to apologize for that!
Yeah, maybe not... but you're about to pay for it.
Because you just confessed.
JT, you can stop recording.
I think we have everything we need.
(beeping)
Okay.
I won't be the only one who pays.
DHS will find those tapes, sooner or later.
You'll be exposed.
Yeah. We know.
But I'm not about to let innocent people die just to protect my identity.
Nor will we let you use Vincent to do whatever else you wanted him to do.
I didn't want Vincent to
 something.
I wanted him to
 something.
Something only a beast
 stop.
Please don't tell me there's another beast out there.
I don't believe you for a second.
Well, you better believe me, because if DHS arrests me, you won't know how to stop him.
(scoffs)
He's lying.
Let's get outta here.
No!
(yelling)
(grunts)
: No! You're the... you're the only one-- you're the only one... who can stop him!
(siren wailing in distance)
: Agent Dylan.
Looks like you got the mother lode.
Thanks for the backup, Captain.
Much appreciated.
Hey, we're on the same team, right?
Did you get Keller?
No, he got away.
So, what, he led you here just so you could bust Braxton?
Apparently.
Got Braxton on tape confessing, too.
I've been trying to bring that b*st*rd down for years.
He even implicated Erik Lee, lucky you.
So it kind of makes you wonder, right?
Why a fugitive like Keller would want to help us bust Graydal
 Lee?
Look, just because Keller did something good, doesn't mean he's not still bad.
Right, but why would he risk getting caught just to help you nail Braxton?
(scoffs)
Hey, maybe he's not so bad after all.
Maybe there's more to what he did than you know.
Maybe. Yeah.
Let's see what turns up on Braxton's computers.
All right.
(thunder rumbling)
♪ Help me ♪

♪ 'Cause I'm feeling shaky ♪

♪ Tell me what's wrong with my brain... ♪
(Vincent sighs deeply)
Maybe you should go.
It's only a matter of time before they find you here.
I'd rather they found me here than anywhere else.
Catherine, I'm done running.
But what if DHS has found Braxton's tapes?
I'm screwed either way.
It's not fair.
Hill set you up, Braxton set you up.
Come on, it doesn't matter.
Yes, it does, Vincent.
You're a good man.
You know? You've sacrificed too much.
 sacrificed too much to have it end like this.
Well, nobody said life was fair, huh?
We have to keep fighting, Vincent-- for us.
It's not gonna be easy.
Once I'm exposed to the world...
If you're exposed.
I will be.
It's just a matter of time before DHS finds those tapes.
We can't stop it.
Then maybe we should run.
Maybe we should get away from here.
Really? Where?
I don't know. Anywhere.
All I care about is if we're together.
Hey...
♪ 'Cause I'm afraid of the light ♪

♪ Yeah, you know what I mean ♪
We could, you know.
We could; we've done what we set out to do-- we found out who's after me, we saved lives.
But what if he was telling the truth?
What if there's another...?
There's not, okay?
All of that ended long ago.
Braxton would've said anything to save his own ass.
(urgent knocking on door)
(thunder rumbles)
(knocking on door)
It's gonna be okay.
(knocking on door)
You need to come with me.
(latch clicks)
(drawer rattles, clunks)
Ugh. Okay. Yeah.
Where's the rest of him?
Don't know. This is all they found.
Okay, are you sure that this is Braxton?
(sighs) DNA and dental records match.
Where'd it happen?
In jail, after DHS arrested him.
Huh. So Braxton wasn't lying after all.
It seems we have another beast on our hands.
But how's that possible?
