Previously on The Fosters...
But I'm not coming home. I'm gonna live here with Cortney.
I've got a kid and a husband who's suing for full custody because I'm an unfit mother.
Can I help you?
Sheila.
You adopted Kyle?
Kyle is in prison.
Are you worried I still have feelings for Gabe?
Do you?
God's gonna send me the boyfriend I want when the time is right.
Why did you bring me here?
I thought you'd like it.
Really? It didn't have anything to do with the fact that Noah's gay?
I'm Aaron.
Cameron.
I've been interning at the Juvenile Justice Project.
They help minors who were given unfair trials.
You look really handsome.
You are like a foot taller since I last saw you.
And his voice is like an octave lower.
(deep voice) No, it isn't.
Oh, Lord.
: Pizza's here!
Hi, guys, so good to see you. Glad you could make it!
Oh, thank you.
And my baby daughter's 40th birthday party!
I wouldn't miss it for the world, although I suppose it means I'm finally old.
You've been old for a while, dear.
Hey, sweetheart, how are you holding up?
I'm fine.
Your mom told us about that boy, Nick.
You were very brave.
I'm just glad it's over.
Yeah, you know, I'm thinking that we should cancel our room at the hotel and spend the whole weekend here.
Why?
Well, we could spend more time with our grandkids.
Is it okay?
Yeah, they could stay in Brandon's room.
: And where would Brandon sleep?
Jesus.
What? He doesn't live here anymore.
: I'm sorry, where does Brandon live?
With his married girlfriend and her three-year-old son.
Mariana.
She's, um... getting a divorce.
Well, then, so long as she's getting a divorce.
Why on earth would you allow Brandon to move in with an older woman and her child?
She's hardly an older woman.
And believe me, we're not allowing him, he's 18.
: Oh, sorry. Found the... air mattress.
Are we gonna meet this girlfriend at your birthday party?
Actually, I'm not sure.
Brandon says she doesn't think she'd be welcome.
Perceptive girl.
So you don't approve?
It's not that we don't approve of her. We just... don't approve of the situation, but we don't want to push Brandon away.
Well, how much further can he get?
(sighs)
Actually, I was thinking you should invite Cort to the party, personally.
Me? Why me?
Because it's my 40th birthday party and I'm pretty sure I'm not the one she's afraid of.
Um, Dana, I really don't think this is going to fit in here comfortably.
Sweetheart, just set it up in the living room.
Stewart can sleep down there.
: Okay.
(thud) Oh! Hold on. Okay.
Uh...
Mom.
Something going on with you and Daddy?
Turns out there's a reason that your father doesn't want to be alone with me in a hotel room, and it has nothing to do with spending more time with his grandchildren.
He's having an affair.
(theme music playing)
What, piano lessons? Really?
Dang, you must be desperate for money, huh?
Yeah, kinda.
Rent's coming up, and, of course, divorce is gonna cost a ton, so...
How much?
5,000 bucks.
Holy...
Yep.
Good thing that's not your problem, huh?
Yeah.
Okay, so I have some good news.
We got a C-STEM grant, which means we now have enough money to enter the regional robotics competition.
Huh? How does that sound?
Now, we have a ton of building and programming to do, but first we have to figure out which three of you will lead us onto the field of battle, as driver, strategist, and shooter.
Any takers?
Is this... we want this?
Yes, we want this.
No girls have ever represented Anchor Beach behind the glass. Just put your hand up.
: ... a little friendly competition.
You have 24 hours to build a robot that can pick up this block and dump it into this basket.
The club will then vote for a winner based on speed, design, and creativity.
You'll be working together in teams of three, so... choose wisely.
All right, good luck.
Right now.
Wow, didn't see that coming.
Wanna join us?
So, this, uh, boyfriend of yours... you don't talk about him very much.
Yeah, I'm not really the type of girl to talk about her boyfriend a lot.
I see, but, uh... that's it?
It's not because he doesn't actually exist?
No, he exists, trust me.
If you say so.
'Course, uh, some people say Big Foot exists, but I won't believe it until I see it with my own eyes.
(buzzer sounds)
: Go ahead.
Hey, Kyle.
God, it's been a long time, huh?
Hey, Callie.
You look good.
Thanks for coming to see me.
I don't get a lot of visitors, except my mom.
And it's hard on her seeing me in here.
Of course.
I would have come sooner if I had known.
Sorry, this is Aaron.
He works at the Juvenile Justice Center.
I'm an intern.
Oh, cool...
They take on cases like yours, where a minor might not have gotten a fair trial.
You... you think you can help me?
Uh, well, we got to find something to get them to open the case back up.
We talked to your mom, and she said that there was a witness, an alibi witness, who your lawyer never contacted.
Yeah, um...
Patrick Molloy.
He worked at the rec center.
That's where I was the afternoon that Mrs. Johnson was killed.
You know I didn't do it, right?
I mean, I would never have hurt her.
She was always really nice to me.
I believe you.
(knocking) Hey, baby.
Hey! Daddy, what... what are you doing here?
Well, I just needed to talk to you without your mother around.
Got a minute?
: So, what did you get?
On my SAT? Uh, 1450.
Nice.
So, when are you taking the test? Because I was thinking...
It's tomorrow.
Uh... isn't that a little late for a tutor?
Well, yeah, but, you know, I was kind of thinking that you could take it for me.
Uh...
I... I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Look, I'll pay you.
A thousand bucks, cash.
So... why didn't you sign in at the rec center that day?
: I... I don't know.
I guess I just forgot.
But I was there.
It was raining, we were all inside.
I was watching the game with Patrick.
We were yelling at the refs, 'cause Griffin kept getting fouled and they weren't calling it.
Do you know if he still works there?
I don't know.
I'm sure we can track him down.
You think if he says I was there...
I might get a new trial?
Maybe.
Hey, I, uh... I brought you a book.
Uh, they said they'd give it to you.
Sideways Stories from Wayside School, remember it?
Yeah. We loved that book.
I must have read it 10 times.
Except Jude. Jude...
Hated it, yeah.
How is Jude?
He's good.
He's tall.
No way.
He's like taller than me now.
Wow!
: Time's up, Kyle.
I'll come see you again.
I won't be here.
I turn 18 next month, so... they're moving me to Folsom Prison.
We'll talk to Molloy.
We'll find him.
Just... hang on, okay?
So, Dad is not having an affair.
Told ya.
He's been sneaking around 'cause he's putting together this video for mom's retirement party.
Honest to God, made me want to cry.
He's got everyone sending these little video clips saying nice things about her.
Isn't that the sweetest thing you ever heard?
Yeah, it is.
So, what do I do?
Do I tell her that's what he's been up to so she stops acting so paranoid?
Well, kind of ruins the surprise, doesn't it?
That's true.
Okay, I'm just going to stay out of it.
It's usually for the best where my parents are concerned, anyway.
Did you know that many of the British codebreakers during World War II were women?
As were many of the first NASA mathematicians and engineers.
Seriously?
Not that you'd ever read about them in the history books.
It's still a man's world.
Well, in STEM Club it is, anyway.
Which, my dears, is why you need to kick those boys' asses.
Oh, we will, Gram.
Okay. So here's an idea.
Everyone else is gonna design their robots to scoop up the blocks, right?
Hey.
Well, what if we used these instead?
We could attach the zip ties to the pipes, arrange them vertically, and if we could program the pipes to spin around fast enough...
It acts like a vacuum.
We'd win for sure.
That's kind of brilliant.
But no way the ties can lift the block.
What if you used these instead?
We don't need a boy's help.
Yeah, and how do you suppose that we attach this around this?
Fine. So, uh, you wanna hang?
I'm kind of busy here, Jesus.
Yeah, boy toy, run along.
Hey...
Okay, we're making a video for mama's party.
Like the party that's tomorrow?
Yes, and I need you to edit it for me.
Well, I can't.
And shouldn't you have gotten on this like weeks ago?
Yes, Mariana, but I just thought of it now.
Okay, well... get Jude to do it.
Do what?
(Stef sighs)
Mama's birthday video.
I just need one of my computer-savvy children who loves me... to help me put it together. What do you say?
Okay.
I can try.
Really?
I've never edited anything, but...
I might know someone who can help.
Yeah?
Who?
Noah.
(knock on door)
Oh, hi. Brandon just left.
That's okay, I actually wanted to talk to you, if that would be all right.
Yeah, um, come in.
Um... sorry.
That's all right.
We were just playing earlier.
How you doing?
Good. How are you?
I'm well, thanks.
I wanted to invite you to Lena's birthday party.
It would mean a lot to her and to me, of course, if you would come.
Um, so, it's a '70s theme party.
Don't know how quickly you can get together a pair of bellbottoms on such short notice, but it would be great if you could come.
Thank you. Yeah, um...
I'd love to come.
Great! Okay.
(cell phone rings)
Oh.
Sorry, this is work. Do you mind?
No, no, sure, no problem.
Hello? Hey.
Hi, are you Patrick Malloy?
Yes.
Hi, I'm Callie Adams Foster, and this is Aaron Baker.
We talked to a friend of yours at the rec center, said we could find you here.
Okay.
We're friends of Kyle Snow.
Do you remember him?
Yeah.
He killed that lady, right?
He was found guilty, but we don't think he was given a fair trial.
Kyle says he was with you at the rec center on the day that Mrs. Johnson was murdered.
And you were watching a Clippers game.
Do you remember that?
Yeah, I do.
It was raining, so all the kids were inside.
It was crazy.
But I...
I don't remember Kyle being there.
Are you sure?
He said that you were complaining about the refs?
Sorry.
Would it have been possible for a kid to be at the rec center and forget to sign in?
Yeah, sure. I mean, if it was busy and nobody noticed, that could happen.
Okay, thank you.
He was a nice kid.
I wish I could help.
Thanks.
Look, it was four years ago.
It's possible he just doesn't remember seeing Kyle, but it doesn't mean that he wasn't there.
I just really thought for a second...
I guess nothing's ever that simple.
Or fair.
Well, maybe there's something else.
Another hole in the case.
Listen, you don't have to do this.
Maybe I want to.
I really do have a boyfriend.
Okay.
I really do want to help.
I've been in juvie twice.
It was pretty awful.
But Folsom, it's gotta be hell.
Just don't know if he'll make it.
(car alarm chirps)
Yuccch.
What can I say about Lena? She's perfect.
And it's weird because that is usually something I hate in a person.
I mean, really, what's more ho...
(keyboard clicks)
: She's a trip.
You have no idea.
Okay, so you move the cursor to where you want the cut and then you can dissolve or fade or whatever.
Hey, thanks for showing me all this.
No problem.
I do this kind of stuff for my church all the time.
(Taylor gasps)
What?
Nothing.
No, what?
I was online and...
I saw that Connor's in San Diego.
Did he tell you he's coming?
Who's Connor?
He's, uh, my ex... boyfriend.
He moved to L.A., so we broke up.
Hey, did you find something strong enough to lift your cube with?
(sighs) No, we're trying something else.
What if you don't have to?
I figured why go around the pipe if you could go through it?
19 seconds. That's the time to beat.
You're next.
: What?
You've got to be kidding me.
We got this.
You ready?
Oh-ho-ho! Nine seconds. That's great.
I'm sorry, did you say something earlier?
I didn't think so.
Yeah.
Name?
Tristan Chacones.
Good luck.
Thank you.
So, I've tallied all the votes, combined that with the points earned for speed, and... we have a winner.
Aiden, Dan, and Jeffrey.
Um, our robot completed the task in less than half the time, and it couldn't have done that without the superior design and creativity.
True, but those are subjective assessments.
Maybe, but ours was also autonomous.
: That's worth double the points in competition.
If Anchor Beach is gonna beat these bigger schools, we can't do it with the same designs and same old strategies.
We've gotta be different.
Uh...
You know what?
You're right.
And I apologize.
I'm overturning the club's decision.
: Are you serious?
: Look, I get it, but you should have voted for them in the first place, and you know that.
: Oh, my God!
Congratulations.
(giggling) Really?
Way to play the girl card.
Brandon?
Hey! Brandon!
(wolf whistle)
Damn! Oh, my God.
Come here. Gimme some sugar.
Oh, watch the lips.
That lipstick took me a half-hour, believe it or not.
Oh, come on now.
(telephone rings)
Oh, will you get that?
Yeah.
Hello.
Uh, no, I don't think so.
Honey, did you order a house appraisal?
: No. Why would I get our house appraised?
Uh, sorry, I think there must be some mistake.
Oh, uh, probably my fault.
Uh, we'll have to call you back.
(nervous laugh)
You're getting our house appraised?
I completely forgot to mention it. My apology.
Dana and I are switching financial advisors, and we're restructuring our trust and putting all our ducks in a row, for retirement, you know.
Okay.
And this new guy, he wants a complete list of all of our assets and our obligations and that includes the house, because I'm co-borrower on the loan, so he's probably just being overly thorough, that's all.
(disco music plays)
Whoa!
Stop it. Where is the bar?
Eh...
Oh, okay, I'm not gonna lie.
I kind of can't wait for my mom to eat a little crow when she finds out why my dad's been acting so weird.
I'm just confused. Why would he list our house as an asset?
Uh, I guess because technically it is.
Well...
(disco music plays)
You like?
I love!
You didn't have to do all this.
You only turn 40 once, baby.
(chuckles)
Mr. Saturday Night Fever himself!
Look at that!
Ironic, given the fact that I don't really dance.
Hey, I get one birthday wish, and it's to see you do the Hustle.
Well, that's sad, but for you, I'll do it.
: Be careful what you wish for 'cause I've seen it.
You invited Gabe?
Yeah, he's been here all week working, so Lena thought it would be nice to invite him.
You know?
Hey.
Hey.
Don't get to the gym much, huh?
So that's why he didn't tell me he was in San Diego.
He came with his new boyfriend.
Gross.
The least he could have done is told me instead of letting me find out like this.
Hey, you made it.
Of course.
All right, cuteness overload.
You two, get together.
Come on.
(phone camera clicks)
(disco music continues)
Wow!
(chuckles)
Really? It's not too...
Debbie Harry?
I have no idea who that is.
All I know is I like what I see.
Back atcha, stud.
Did you hear that we beat the boys in STEM today?
Yeah, Mariana practically called a press conference.
Well, we couldn't have done it without your help.
Perhaps I could do a little something for you.
You know, to thank you?
Hmm.
Yeah, yeah, I can probably think of something.
And also, maybe, I could start tutoring you again.
Wait, what?
So you can get a head start for the SATs.
(new disco song starts)
Hey.
Hi.
I don't want this to be weird.
I mean, it's not weird for me.
No, I totally agree. It doesn't have to be weird at all.
So...
You seeing anybody?
Uh, yeah, I'm dating.
Oh, hell no!
It's my ex, with some barely pubescent girlfriend.
(scoffs) Excuse me.
No, no, no, no!
I'm not gonna be the only people on the dance floor.
Come on, look.
I've been watching those old 
 videos on YouTube.
Have you?
Let me show you what I got.
: Hey, guys.
(chuckles)
What?
(clears throat) No, it's a nice perm.
Oh, he's Greg Brady.
It was her idea.
Who's Greg Brady?
Hey, uh, be right back.
Okay.
Uh, excuse me.
Hey, so I just wanted to thank you for inviting Cort.
It meant a lot to her.
And me.
Of course, yeah.
Okay, well, I'm gonna go tell Mama happy birthday.
Bye.
Okay, so why don't you like her?
She seems nice enough, I guess.
She's taken advantage of him.
How so?
(sighs)
Lena doesn't know this and I didn't want to ruin her party, but... she's...
He's using his money to pay her bills.
What bills?
So, thank you for inviting all of my exes.
I thought I was the one who got you in the divorce.
Sorry.
Hey, how'd it go today? The SATs.
I saw you when I was picking up Garrett.
Uh, yeah, I think it went pretty well.
You took the SATs today?
Uh, yeah, um...
You know, I just wanted to take it again and see if I could improve my scores.
God, I practically had to bribe Garrett to get him to take it even once. All rightie.
Mmm!
I am going to go get a refill.
Uh, anyone?
Okay.
(disco music continues)
Hey.
Um... uh, nice get-up.
Oh, no, we're having a costume party for my mom's birthday.
Oh, sorry, I can leave.
No, I was actually trying to stay off the dance floor, so come in.
(disco music in distance)
(closes door) So, what's up?
Kyle's lawyer did speak to Patrick Molloy.
Four years ago.
These are his notes.
Molloy said he remembered seeing Kyle at the rec center on March 23rd 'cause they were watching the Clippers-Warriors game together, just like Kyle said.
Wha... where did you find this?
Remember Sheila told us that she had all of Kyle's old files in the garage?
I did a little digging through them, and there it was.
Oh, my God, thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
(AJ clears throat)
Hey, um...
AJ, this is Aaron. Aaron, this is AJ, my boyfriend.
Hey.
So you do exist.
Look at them. God.
She does know Little Miss Stripy Pants only makes her look older, doesn't she?
I don't get it.
Yeah, I'm actually gonna go...
Ooh! Now, that, on the other hand, mm!
If I weren't gay, I'd climb him like a jungle gym.
You coming?
Uh, nah, I'm gonna sit this one out.
Mm, not me.
Mom, come dance with me and Daddy.
He can't ask me himself?
(sighs)
This is silly.
Mom, Dad is not having an affair.
He's just busy with retirement and restructuring the trust and getting a new business manager.
There's a lot on his plate.
What new business manager? What are you talking about?
He didn't tell me anything about all that.
So, you're doing okay, after everything that happened with Nick?
Yeah, uh, I'm fine. I just...
I kind of wish people would stop asking me.
Okay, good.
But you and Mat, you're back together, right?
Where is he?
We are. Uh, college tour.
Ah.
Speaking of getting back together... did you ever think maybe... you and Gabe?
'Cause I mean it would kind of be crazy romantic.
Don't let Mike hear you say that.
Why?
Oh, my God, are... you and Mike like "a thing"?
Maybe?
Oh, is that okay?
Yeah, of course, I love Mike.
Me too.
You're in love.
I haven't told him yet.
Our secret, I promise.
(both chuckling)
(disco jazz plays)
Hello. You must be Cortney.
I'm Brandon's grandmother, Dana Adams.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you, Mrs. Adams.
I've heard so much about you.
Really?
And all I know about you is that you're a young married mother allowing your high-school-age boyfriend to pay for your divorce.
You don't think it's a little weird that my mom didn't know anything about my dad getting them a new business manager?
(Stef sighs) I don't know, love.
Maybe he's the one that handles the finances.
: That's what Kelly did.
Right before she left me.
She started moving money around and hiding it.
If I were paying more attention, I would have known she was gonna divorce me.
Hey, why aren't you dancing?
I don't know.
Just too dumb, I guess.
So, how could Molloy forget giving this statement to Kyle's lawyer?
: Maybe he didn't.
Maybe he changed his story.
Why would he do that?
Could be anything.
Maybe he was being intimidated by someone.
Like who?
: I don't know. A prosecutor?
Or maybe he was protecting someone.
Like if he had something to hide.
All right, you young people, I know that the '70s is probably just a chapter in your history books, but the dance floor beckons, huh, let's go!
Don't have to tell me twice. I'll see you out there.
Yeah, I'll be out in a second.
: And who is this?
I'm Aaron, Mrs. Adams Foster.
Oh, Aaron who took my daughter for a ride on his motorcycle Aaron.
Yeah.
Um, we were just looking at a few of Kyle's case files, and we found this guy, this witness, who changed his story.
Do you think you could check him out, see if he has a record?
Sure. When it's not Mama's birthday, all right?
You're welcome to stay, Aaron.
Oh, thanks, but I should probably head out.
Okay.
Sorry.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
What?
So, what are we calling you guys?
Judah?
Maybe Juno?
Um... Juno?
Well, if you're changing your relationship status, you've got to come up with a couple name, right?
Uh...
Are you cheating on Mom?
What? No!
Then why does she think you are?
Are you planning on leaving her?
Why doesn't she know about the new business manager, Dad?
What are you two talking about?
Dana, honey, I'm not cheating on you.
Who said you were?
Mom.
Okay, there is something that I've been keeping from you.
Both of you.
Are you okay, Dad?
Noah, please, don't go.
Look, I don't know what's going on with you and your ex, but, dude, leave me out of it.
I'm really sorry.
I didn't want him to think I was sitting around and... crying about him or something.
I get wanting to make him feel jealous.
But I hate social media.
Why?
A lot of people don't like the fact that a minister's son is openly gay.
And they tell me about it.
I'll take it down, okay?
I didn't mean to...
And if you're gonna go around and tell everyone we're like boyfriends or whatever... you should at least ask me out first.
I... should?
Um...
(clears throat)
Okay, um... would you like to go out sometime?
That's better.
I have some tax issues with the IRS.
I owe some money.
Wait, Dad.
Why am I just finding this out now?
I didn't wanna worry you, honey.
You're not just talking about your money, it's our money.
Yes, I know perfectly well, Dana, but they were my mistakes.
I wanted to find a solution, so we both didn't have to stress out.
How much do we owe?
Nothing I can't handle.
That's why I wanted an appraisal of the house.
I know you and Stef must have some equity in it by now.
I can take out a line of credit and pay it off, no problem.
Except Stef and I already took out a line of credit on the house.
What for?
What?
The adoption fees for Callie and Jude.
House repairs, the remodel.
Day-to-day stuff with five kids, Dad.
Oh, my God, Stewart.
No, please, baby, don't worry!
Stop telling me not to worry.
We have a lot of options.
I got us into this mess, I can get us out.
All right?
Last thing I wanted to do was ruin you party.
: Okay, if everybody could gather around, please.
Everybody. Got a little surprise for the birthday girl, wherever she is.
Hi, my love.
Uh...
Wow, 40. You're in your 40s.
You can tell me what that's like maybe a little bit later.
Um...
So, in honor of this totally arbitrary milestone, your friends and family have put together a bit of a tribute to show you just how much you mean to them.
(soft music plays)
(soft laughter)
: 
Are you seriously 40? That is crazy old.
: 
: What?
(chuckles)
Hey, you okay?
Did you tell your grandmother you paid for my lawyer?
No. Why?
: 
So we got you pot holders!
: 
We hope you like 'em.
: Yeah, you're welcome, Mama.
: 
: We love you.
Think anyone would notice if we went upstairs for a little bit?
It's my mom's party. I don't really feel like leaving, so...
Maybe later?
I don't think so.
Matter of fact, I don't think this whole "friends with benefits" thing is working out for me.
So... 
And I am so lucky to have you guys... (doorbell rings) ... in my life. Happy birthday.
: 
: 
: Hey, darlin'.
It was 40 years ago in that, oh, cramped little 
I just felt a love I didn't even know existed, baby.
: 
 for me and your mom, always be that tiny little baby.
I'm just glad I don't have to comb your hair anymore.
(laughter)
: 
: We love you, baby.
Happy birthday.
(Stef sighs)
: Mom?
Mom, the cops are here.
: What?
Can I help you?
: We're looking for a Lena Adams Foster.
Uh, that's me.
Mrs. Adams Foster, you're under arrest...
What?
... for being way too hot.
: Yes!
Oh, my...
Oh, thank you, thank you! Now this is a party!
A party! Whoo!
Go, ladies. Go, ladies.
(cheering)
(dance music playing)
Oh, yes!
Make it rain!
Ladies, make it rain!
Whoo! Oh, God help me!
Go, ladies!
Come on!
Make it rain for Mama. Come on, whoo!
Go!
Oh, God help me! Go! Whoo!
(seventies slow jazz plays)
Hey, uh... we're gonna go, but I wanna say happy birthday.
Oh, thank you, honey!
Ugh! I'll be right back.
Okay.
So, how does Grandma know that I'm loaning Cort money for her divorce?
'Cause I told her.
Uh-huh. And how do you know?
When I was at the apartment, yesterday, your checkbook was sitting on the table, so I looked at it.
You had no right to do that.
True.
It's my money.
It was.
(Lena on mic) Stefanie Marie Adams Foster, may I please have this dance?
See you later.
Happy birthday.
I don't quite know how to thank your mom for sending the cops.
(Stef chuckles)
Hey.
Will you please ask her to dance?
I got two left feet.
Come on, Ana doesn't care. She loves you.
I mean... you didn't hear it from me.
♪ Ah, some voice to cheer me ♪
Finally!
Now, look, I may not have Gabe's abs or his moves, but... let me finish.
Ohh.
I love you, too.
Mariana is dead to me.
♪ It's the sweetness of your charms... ♪
So, I was thinking, you should join STEM Club.
Ha ha, yeah. You're hilarious.
No, I'm being serious.
You should join the robotics team.
I think you'd be a really big asset.

♪ When I needed you the most ♪
(electronic dance music on phone)
Hey, you wanna dance? Oh, come on.
Yeah, you do.
You wanna show me those 
 moves?
No? This one.
Yeah? No, come on.
How bad is it?
There's a lien on their house.
Are you saying...
You mean they could lose their home?
