So, we need someone who can vouch for you, like a character witness.
Maybe Aunty Joan?
Who's Aunty Joan?
She's my godmother, she knew me mum.
I find you interesting Vera a bit too vanilla for you, Jake?
Get me a g-bag of powder.
You get me that phone, we have a deal.
I saved your life, you were gone.
But I never gave up on you If you get a second chance, you grab it and you don't let go.

Eh!
Bea's weak.
2IC's crook.
Her crew's all over the f*cking shop.
So?
We take her down.
Red Right Hand and your girls.
We take Bea down...
And finally get equality for all the women in here.
: f*ck equality!
Unless all the women are getting shit-faced on my gear.
[Scoffs]
: Ah, Tina... f*ck it!
Have you forgotten what she did to you?
We take Bea down... you'll be Top Dog and look after my sh1t.
I don't want Top Dog!
Betrays all my principles.
Well then, go f*ck your principles!
: Ooh, my own personal stylist...
I could get used to this.
: Yeah, I do weddings, proms and court appearances.
So, what are you thinking?
Well... ah, maybe a little up do?
So the judge can see how open and honest your face is.
But sexy as hell, right?
Oh, yeah!
[Door opens]
: Mmm.
I need the shower block cleared. Finish that in H1.
[Bea laughs]
[Knock on door]
Governor, have you got a moment?
[Phone ringing in background]
Of course, Mr Stewart.
[Door closes]
[Train horn sounds in background]
Ooh!
[Vera chuckles]
[Whispers] Look, no, no, no, no. Not... not here! Not here!
What? Come on.
But you pulled the blinds down!
Not... not...!
Oh... is that why you wanted...
Oh, right!
.. to see me?
Well, isn't that enough?
No... I, uh, I actually had a question about my chances for a salary advance.
Oh... well unfortunately that is against, ah, departmental protocol.
Yeah, no I thought so.
Remember I told you about the microbrewery?
Yes.
I have found the perfect space in Collingwood.
Oh.
Only, a couple of other buyers are are circling like sharks.
The owner needs 20K cash deposit today, or it's gone.
I can get 10 together, but... [inhales] just, I'm 10 short.
10 thousand, today?
It's the way these guys operate, only deal in cash, play investors off against each other.
[Tsks]
I can't.
I thought the idea of my not being an employee might appeal.
[Groans]
If I break the rule for you, I'd have Linda up here every Friday, I'm sorry.
No, it's cool. I... I understand.
Just thought I'd ask.
Yep.
[Inhales]
[Phone rings in background]

So... [Sighs] you got the whole prison talkin', Bea.
Gah, [Scoffs] yeah.
[Liz and Boomer chuckle]
Slow news day obviously.
Hey, you, like, gonna eat that...
Now you're a "vagitarian".
[Sonia chuckles]
Susan, that's very witty.
[Boomer chuckles] Yeah, that's me. I'm witty, I'm witty, aren't I?
: Yeah, oh yeah.
Leave it, leave it.
Hey, you know I pashed a girl once.
Yeah, I-I was pissed but, but I dunno. Do you reckon that makes me bisexual?
Oh, yeah.
"Beersexual" perhaps?
[Bea's crew laughing]
That's f*ckin' witty too, eh? [laughs]
[Liz laughs]
High five! [Laughs]
Hey... we should probably get going.
Oh, yes. You've got your sentencing today, haven't you?
Oh, yeah. Good luck, love.
Yeah, just give the judge a gobby, eh?
: Boomer!
Oh, love, Oh, what?
That's gross, Booms!
: *** team!
: Yuck!
What are you doing?
Are you trying to humiliate me?
Yeah, 'cause it's all about you, Kaz.
Hey! You let her go.
It's okay.
No, no, it's not okay. She doesn't have any rights over you.
You lied, straight to my face!
I know that Allie didn't have anything to do with that attack on me.
You think you're special, 'cause you got her off the gear?
I've pulled Allie out her own sh1t so many times I can't even remember.
If I hadn't have been there, she wouldn't have survived.
[background chatter and kitchen noises]
[Door opens and closes]
You touch her again...
I'll break your f*ckin' arm!
[background chatter and laughing]
f*ck it, I'll do it!
What?
We take Bea down. I'll take on Top Dog.
And you'll protect my sh1t?
Mate, how long did you party after I left?
You left?
[Stewart chuckles]
So, dude, are we on again for tonight, or do you need a night off, to powder your v*g1n*?
[Jackson chuckles]
We're on.
: Right.
Will, have you seen Mr Stewart?
Yeah, you, um, you just missed him.
He's, ah, he's gone on a shift.
Right, isn't that where you should be?
Mm.
Are you fit for duty?
Yeah.
Just... a bit of a headache.
I have to be out for half an hour, you're in charge.
[Door closes]
: What, he's living at her house?
: And he's callin' her his godmother.
And "Aunty Joan"?
Are you sure he's got no connections at Walford that could get to Jesper?
No, he's just a messed up kid, he doesn't mix with that crowd.
The trial's on Thursday, so you better keep him close.
: I'm on it.
And find out what the f*ck she wants from him!
Stop swingin' your dick around. I said I'm on it.
[Bea chuckles]
[Pops lips]
What?
How's you love life, Red?
Has it improved since my last visit?
Don't give me sh1t, Franky.
I'm getting a different vibe.
Bullshit!
What's goin' on? What's goin' on?
Nothing.
[Bea scoffs]
She's got her sentencing today.
Oh, right.
Awwww.
[Bea chuckles wistfully]
You got it bad, Red.
[Bea snorts and chuckles]
You're in love, aren't ya?
Have you, ah...
What?
.. tried the "McMuff"?
Piss off!
[Franky laughs]
Not yet.
[Franky Whispers] Oh.
It tastes like chicken.
[Laughs] f*ck!
Really?
No!
[Bea sighs]
[Franky laughs]
[Knock at door]
You wanted to see me, Governor?
Close the door, Mr Stewart.
[Phone ringing in background]
I know, I'm hard to resist.
It's a loan.
Are you trying to get rid of me?
Maybe.
Thank you.
And I'll pay it back, with interest.
Mm-mm.
Forget the interest, it's a favour.
Are you sure you can afford this?
Yeah, I've go...
I've got savings, and...
I don't want you to miss out on your dream because of the department's inflexibility.
I would do you right here, right now, if it wasn't for...
Maybe you need to call me to the plant room again.
I think it's your move, Governor.

I have been watching over you.
So, you're saying that I'm important to you?
Yes!
That you care about me?
I do... I-I-I care about you, of course.
If you cared so much... why the f*ck (!) didn't you come and get me, back then?

Mate, we're just gettin' started.
Hey! Well, how about my offer?
90K and you're in!
Will?!
f*ck!
[Car engine revs]
[General street noises]
[Thumping bass from stereo as car approaches]
[Tyres squeal]
[Car doors open]
Oh, hey, Turk.
[Car doors slam]
How's it goin', mate?
: Jesus, what? Argh!
: Eh, you think you're hard to find?
Where's my f*ckin' money, mm?!
: Yeah... look, I'm-I'm workin' on it, mate. Argh!
: Ah, ah, oh! Uh!
[Gun cocks]
: Right...
: Uh! Oh!
[Gun fires a blank]
: Oh!
Now, I want my in my bank account by midday tomorrow afternoon, or next time this'll be f*cking loaded! You got it?!
f*ckin' piece of sh1t!
[Liquid trickling]
[Stewart strains]
Let's go.
[Stewart panting] f*ck!
[Still panting] sh1t!
[Breathing slows]
[Car doors close, car screeches off]
[Tyres squeal]
[Whispered] Oh, sh1t! Oh, f*ck!
[Car screeches off]
[Birds twittering]
[Knock at door]
[Bashes on door again]
Shayne?!
Everything you said is true.
: He f*cked me life up.
And yours, eh?
I'll do it.
[Ferguson chuckles]
Oh, sh1t!
Gonna be late for my community service. My Legal Relief is gonna go mental.
Surely they'll overlook a few minutes' tardiness.
: You don't know Franky. She'll kill me.
[Papers rustle]
[Door opens]
[Keys jangle]
This is bullshit.
I know who you are.
Aunty Joan told me everything.
So, what's goin' on. What the f*ck does she want you to do?
What, is it take the blame? Like you did for your mate, Frosty. Is that it?
Get out.
What? Say you were working with Jesper, some f*cked up revenge for Will Get out.
Jackson and what he did to your mum?
Franky, get out!
Huh? Shayne, she's manipulating you.
She... she's f*cking using you!
You're the user!
You've been lying to me from the start!
I've been helping you!
Bullshit!
Bullshit, nothing you've said is true!
Shayne, we can just...
: Get out!
Get out!
Get... out!
Ge the f*ck out!
[Door slams closed]
[Cell door slides open]
[Door beeps unlocked]
[Door bangs closed]
[Door creaks open]
: I got you out of the slot so you could make the call.
: What call?
You know what call.
Tell your guy to make the payment before noon.
No gear, no payment.
[Hushed] I got you the gear.
Then you took it away.
I didn't f*cking...!
[Indistinct radio chatter]
[Door beeps unlocked]
That had nothing to do with me.
: So, who lagged?
[Sighs]
Tell me who lagged, I'll call my guy.
Okay.
It was Smith.
Bullshit!
Bea Smith told the Governor to toss your cell.
Now, call your guy and make the payment.
[Guard approaching]
Sure.
Soon as you get me my gear back.
[Door beeps unlocked]
[Door beeps unlocked]
: Thank God we don't have to do this much longer.
[Door closes]
: Soon as she's convicted, out of our hair. She's all yours.
[Door beeps unlocked]
[Door closes]
[Hushed] sh1t!
: You all right, Mr Stewart?
You seem... restless.
[Chuckles nervously and pants]
[Hushed] sh1t!
You know if anyone has a right to feel agitated, you'd think it'd be me.
[Stewart sniffs]
I'm on trial for my life tomorrow...
And yet, there you are a bundle of tension, sh1t!
.. whilst I am as calm as a...
That's because you're a f*ckin' psycho!
.. mill pond.
You, Mr Stewart, are a drug dealer, and not a very good one at that.
You think I didn't know?
Saw that little deal you did with Allie Novak. You've been scrambling ever since they found those drugs in Mercado's cell.
Heard about that happy score of Vera's.
Not so happy for you though, hmm.
You f*ckin' bitch.
You've got yourself into a bit of pickle. Haven't you Jake?
Now, whatever trouble you are in...
I am not it's architect.
Oh, you've got no idea the trouble I'm in.
f*ck it! I am f*cked!
You smug c**t!
I am a dead man!
f*ck it!
I'm so f*cked!
Surely it's not a bad as all that?
I owe a shitload of money!
Money I don't have. These guys... they're gonna kill me.
[Sighs]
f*ck!
Well, if it's just about money... that's something that I've got plenty of.
I could get a lawyer to transfer it in a matter of minutes.
How much do you need?
Uh...
90 grand.
Mm.
[Keys jangle]
What do I have to do for it?
: Where?
: That one right there.
: Can't you see, that looks like a prawn...
[Chuckling] No, it doesn't.
Looks like a seahorse.
[Allie gasps] Oh, sh1t yeah, it does.
Hey, did you know seahorses like to swim in pairs?
Do they?
Yeah, they do.
They link tails so they don't lose each other.
Mmmmm.
[Both laugh]
Hey... you been drinking your water?
She been drinking water?
Oh, yeah. I've been makin' sure, eh?
Yeah and how I'm pissin' like a fountain.
Yeah. Yeah.
: From both ends.
Oh, here we go. What's goin' on 'ere.
Everyone, listen up.
I just heard some pretty disappointing news.
I know who lagged on Tina Mercado.
[General dissent amongst prisoner]
: Who's the f*ckin' lagger? Spit it out.
Me and the boys'll sort her out.
Don't worry about that.
Ooh.
The person who lagged directly to the Governor was Bea Smith.
: What?!
[Prisoners murmuring]
Get out!
: Bullshit.
I know it's hard to believe that your Top Dog would betray you, but it's true.
Oh, get off!
Yeah, get off the f*ckin' table before I punch your tits in.
: Yeah!
Bea. Got anything to say?
Tell us. Tell all of us.
: Yeah, come on.
Did you lag to the Governor, Bea?
Or are you just gonna deny it?
No.
: You are full of sh1t, Kaz.
[Prisoners discussing]
No, I'm not gonna deny it.
It was me.
I lagged.
So what?
So... what.
: So what?
You just betrayed everything you stand for. You're Top Dog.
[Emotionally] Yeah, that's right.
I was sick of the drugs in this place.
And I was sick of Tina crossing me and... and peddling sh1t to my girls.
And that's why I lagged.
To put a stop to it.
Well, you can't be Top Dog and a lagger. It's one or the other.
: Yeah, that's right, ***.
So which one is it, Bea?
Which... one... is it.
That's it.
I'm done.
[Prisoners murmuring]
: Yeah, good riddance.
[Prisoner murmurs grow louder, some clapping]
[Door opens]
Bea.
[Hushed] Oh, God!
You okay?
Hey? [Sighs]
[Bea sighs]
[Exhales with relief]
[Liz chuckles]
I just don't have the energy for it anymore, Liz.
: Mm.
[Sighs]
I thought I needed it...
Things are changing for me.
Oh, yeah. Mm.
You know what... [Inhales]
I'm relieved. I'm-I'm relieved it's over.
So am I. For your sake.
[Liz chuckles]
[Bea sighs]
[Bea chuckles]
You don't need it.
: Mm.
I'll leave you two alone.
Liz?
Mm.
Thank you.
No worries.
[Door closes]
: Yeah and Tasha, Booms?
Yeah, exactly. I don't bloody get it.
Well, what's going on?
Bea lagged.
: Yeah.
Like, why would Bea lag?
Booms, let it go.
She okay?
She's happy.
You could have told me you lagged.
I was tryin' to protect you.
I promise I will never keep anything from you ever again.
I promise you I will never... [Inhales] take another drug again.
[Whispers] Ever.
[Hushed] I don't need 'em anymore.
[Bea gasping and clears throat]
[Bea gasps]
[Bea moans quietly]
[Bea moans quietly]
[Bea exhales softly]
[Bea moans]
[Moaning increases]
[Bea exhales]
Oh!
[Laughing gently and panting]
[Whispers] Bea?
[Whispered] Come have a shower with me before anyone else gets there.
: Mm.
[Bea sighs peacefully in her sleep]
[Indistinct quiet prison noises]
[Water running]
[Door opens]
Bea?
We've still got the place to ourselves.
[Curtain moving on rail]
[Closes shower curtain]
[Water gurgles in sink]
[Gasps]
[Allie screams are muffled]
[Allie continues screaming]
Argh!
[Screaming] Help!
Help!
[Muffled screams]
: Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shhhh.
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
[Muffled gasping]
[Syringe hits the floor]
[Syringe cap hits the floor]
[Muffled gasp]
[Gasps]
Sh-sh-sh-shhh.
Sh-sh-shhh. Don't fight it.
Don't fight.
[Allie gagging and exhales]
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-shhh.
[Allie gagging]
Shhh.
[Allie gagging]
: That's good...
: Don't fight it.
: All the things you've done, don't make you powerful.
They make you sick.
: Allie?
: Allie, wake up. Wake up!
[Siren wails]
I swear to you, she wouldn't do this to herself.
: There's six minutes of footage missing.
An officer's involved.
: Why would someone... I'll shut up.
It's Kaz, it's gotta be Kaz.
: Get the f*ck off me!
Argh!
Get f*cked!
I have a good feeling about today.
[Siren wailing]
Everyone of us who's crossed her, we're all in danger.
[Siren wailing]
This was her plan all along.
You ready?
The unmissable season final of Wentworth. 08:30 PM next Tuesday on SoHo.
