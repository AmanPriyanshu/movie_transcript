Is there news?
No, but it can't be good.
She pointed her gun at me, and she shot me, and then...
(crying): I'm sorry.
I don't want your apologies!
I want my daughter back.
: 
Effectively, he's facing total renal failure.
So he needs a kidney.
Nusrat...
She was my wife.
She hated me and wanted to kill me.
Because you violated her.
You put her fingers inside of her the night of our wedding.
I love you.
(grunting)
(heart monitor flatlines)
Madam. General.
I'm here as foreign secretary.
For now.
Right.
We wouldn't want to be inappropriate.
Your wife for your daughter.
I can't do that.
I want the Al Fayeeds (Emma sobbing) to pay the price for once.
Mommy!
(groans)
No!
(men chanting)
No.
No!
You should try to sleep.
We both should.
She said "Mommy."
"Mommy."
I can still hear it.
Her voice.
I can't get it out of my head.
Calling for me, I can't... (inhales sharply)
They always say "Dada" first.
(laughs)
But Emma, she said "Mama."
"Mommy."
Her first word.
Her last.
We need to get her body back.
I need to see it buried. I need to see her.
Molly, I want her body back, too, but they're not gonna give it to us.
Remove the cloth.
The American president of Abuddin will be more angry over this one's death than his wife's.
We're not going to bury her?
She'll be covered by dirt soon enough.
Till then, let them see.
Her flesh rots the same way ours does.
: 
 be respected as they cope with the tragic death of their beloved daughter, Emma.
How could you be so cold?
(Aziz continues indistinctly)
She was just a child.
I'm not cold.
I'm sorry she's dead.
I don't want anyone to die.
All I'm saying, and mark my words, they will start a war over the death of a single American girl.
Shakir.
(mouth full): Sorry.
Mind your manners, boy.
Where's your prayer?
If Jamal Al Fayeed gases Ma'an and a thousand of us perish, nothing.
When our children die, we weep alone.
Yet they expect the whole world to howl at the death of one of theirs.
Say that in your announcement today.
Do you know my last name?
The one I was born with?
No.
Haddad.
My name is Leila Haddad.
Not an Al Fayeed.
I... just put on the clothes and dress like one.
For more than 20 years.
Now I could just... bury that man's body and leave this place forever.
But that would mean you'd won.
(sobbing)
I gave you everything.
I gave you my life.
And waited for the day my son and I would be rewarded for that sacrifice, Jamal.
It was too high a price.
(inhales deeply)
So what am I still doing, weeping over your body?
I promised myself I wouldn't do that.
(clears throat) We're, um... we're meeting in the war room in ten minutes.
I'm sorry.
You too.
We need to... to, uh... bury Jamal and Rami.
And Emma.
We need to do a memorial service.
The prayers.
Since we don't have her.
Right.
I'll arrange that.
Thank you.
: If we kill Rashid and the sheik, it won't stop the Caliphate. It won't even slow them down.
It'll weaken their internal structure.
Yes, for a time.
But then others will rise up to replace them.
I've seen this countless times, Mr. President.
If you want to destabilize the Caliphate, you've got to think bigger.
I get it, General, and when my army is back to fighting strength, that's exactly what we'll do.
But first I want them dead.
How do we do it?
UAVs armed with air-to-surface missiles.
Once we know where they are, we move.
Then that's the plan.
: On this tragic day, with you and God as my witness, I announce my candidacy for president of Abuddin.
(applause)
It is a dangerous time for our country.
There is a risk we give in to anger, fall prey to our old animosities, resort to violence.
But it's an opportunity.
An opportunity to reclaim our lost heritage, to follow the example, our prophet Muhammad, salla llahu wa-sallam, who taught that extremism and violence has no place in Islam.
(cheering and applause)
My vision is of an authentic Islam, one that remembers that tolerance is fundamental to our faith.
Because...
Islam is salaam.
Peace.
And peace be upon you.
(cheering and applause)
(door opens)
Thank you, Aziz.
Mr. President.
Bassam...
I couldn't bring myself to come here before.
I tried, but...
We have no daughters.
(deep sigh)
My God, Fauzi, I don't know what to do, I'm so lost.
Of course you are.
I prayed to God to let me go back in time one year.
Just give me one more chance.
But we can only go forward.
I'm going to run for president.
And try to finish what you started.
If I can.
So our daughters won't have died for nothing.
(sighs)
Oh, I'm sorry.
What?
Excuse me.
God, what a mess.
Teenagers.
You'd think she was raised by wolves.
Like Romulus and Remus, you know, the... twins who founded Rome.
Ma'am?
When you lose 20% of your blood volume, you go into hypovolemic shock.
I'm sorry we haven't cleaned in here yet.
We thought that...
But that takes minutes.
Maybe hours.
But if... if the knife punctured her kidney... she'd lose consciousness in under a second.
And then dead in a minute.
Lying down there on the ground.
Dead in a minute.
Dead in a minute.
(softly): Dead.

But Jamal needs to be buried very soon.

"Prayers"?
What kind of prayers?
You mean Muslim prayers?
Yes.
But Emma isn't Muslim.
We're the first family of a Muslim country.

I don't care what the people believe.

No.

Yes.
: 
(crowd cheering)
Thank you for coming to show your support for Fauzi Nidal.
On this day of grief, I announce my candidacy for presidency of Abuddin.
My hope for this country is that even in the wake of terrible loss... loss that I and so many of you know too well... we do not lose heart.
But instead that we gain in wisdom.
That we rededicate ourselves to the principles of Bassam Al Fayeed's revolution.
That those of us who are broken and this country that is broken heal together.
And that the battle for a tolerant, modern, Muslim, secular, just and fair Abuddin, begun on a battlefield, ends with a victory at the ballot box.
(crowd cheering)
Aunt Safiya.
Ahmed.
Oh, you look good.
Ah...
Fit.
I clearly missed you turning into a man.
I tried to wait for you, but...
(laughs)
I'm so sorry about your father.
Thank you.
But if you and my mother could be friends again now...
Oh, we'll see about that.
This is business.
Election business.
How are my nephews?
And my niece?
Excited their aunt is running for president.
Is that how their mother feels?
I'm very sorry about Jamal.
Are you? About Jamal?
For your sake, yes.
Even though he's never liked me much.
What I never figured out was whether it was because of that, or because you didn't care for my husband, or that you simply grew tired of me that I stopped hearing from you.
Safiya...
Not that it matters much now.
You called me.
Then again, you need something from me.
I do need something.
Jamal's assets are frozen.
I will give you all the financial support I can.
I've also contacted James Kipfer.
He has advised Merkel, Cameron, Netanyahu.
He's very good.
You move quickly.
I don't want the Caliphate taking control of my husband's shipping lanes.
We need each other, then.
So it seems.
You're not a baby, Ibro.
You make your own decisions.
Like fighting for Allah.
Yes, Sheik.
Al-Fransi?
Phone for the young man.
Candy for the others.
Your father was a good man.
You're right.
These boys are ethnic Ma'anians.
I can tell from their accents.
The idle youth.
They should be in one of my training camps.
Or in school.
I had to shut the schools.
All the teachers left.
Everyone's left.
Engineers, electricians, trash collectors.
You won't keep the people's loyalty, if you can't provide basic services.
With the whole world dropping its bombs on Syria, it will never get better for us here.
We're going to need a better army than the one your brother had.
I'm building an army.
You'll see.
What's with the umbrella?
Eyes in the sky.
Like Argus Panoptes, the hundred-eyed primordial Titan, we see everything everywhere.
General, I have an umbrella.
Show me. An umbrella?
Well, chatter indicates that Abdullah carries a black umbrella with him everywhere.
Let's get details.
That could be Ihab Rashid.
Shadows put him at six feet?
Which is consistent with current intel.
You see how he protects his arm?
That's a prosthetic.
Don't lose him.
(knocking)
Come in.
We have an update, sir.
We have eyes on the target for the first time.
Both of them?
Where are they?
The local hospital.
Most likely they'll be there for the night.
Why?
Oh, that's standard Caliphate operating procedure.
It's the way they protect themselves.
You're sure it's them... if we hit that hospital, we kill them?
Correct.
Who else is inside? How many patients?
How many doctors and nurses?
We don't know.
So it could be empty?
It could be.
He's bought himself another day on Earth.
Keep tracking him.
Understood.
Mr. President.
(door closes)
Hey.
Wait, wait. No.
Wait.
Listen, you need to... Don't!
Don't tell me what I need.
(panting)
Leila?
This is James Kipfer.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Please, sit.
I apologize if I get right to the point, but I have my niece's memorial and my husband's funeral in an hour.
So... tell me how we work together.
Well, first I decide if we work together.
I don't take on just any campaign.
What would you like to know about me?
You're the wife of a despised ex-dictator.
What makes you think anyone would vote for you?
I'm not my husband.
In fact, as you may know, I helped depose him.
I'm the daughter of domestic servants.
Like every poor and working class person in this country, I've spent my life doing what I had to do to survive.
That's made me tough.
Which is a good thing.
Because we're surrounded by enemies.
I wouldn't turn this country over to a cleric who wants to bring us back to the Middle Ages.
Or a journalist who ran away just when things got tough.
They have no idea what this job takes.
But I've been there.
(quiet laugh)
I don't imagine you've got a chance in hell of winning this election.
But I like you.
And I think you mean what you say.
Let's do this.
Great.
By the way, forget the young, the poor, the working class.
It's not your constituency.
Strength, stability, security, prosperity.
Scare them.
Then make them feel safe.
That's your platform.
It's the only one you've got.
Did that help?
For a few minutes, yeah.
I have to go.
Hey.
Come here.
Next time I want to talk about this stuff.
Hmm?
Yeah.
I'm glad I helped you, but...
I'd like to get to know you.
Not just your body.
Okay.
: Sammy, hey, I've been trying to reach you.
I'm worried about you.
Call me, okay?
You did this to me.
You did it to yourself.
You turned me in.
So this? This is your work.
You deserved it.
sh1t.
You're more dangerous than I am.
Oh, you think you've won?

It hasn't even begun.
Peace be upon you.
Upon you be peace.
Peace be upon you.
Upon you be peace.
Peace be upon you.
Where's Mom?
She's uh...
She's not coming.
Where were you this morning?
I couldn't find you.
At the university.
By yourself?
Sammy, do you have any idea how dangerous that is?
What's wrong with you?
I just needed someone to talk to.
: We're gathered here to say prayers for Emma Al Fayeed.
After which, we will move to the family cemetery, and send the bodies of Jamal Al Fayeed and Rami Said back to God.
In the name of God, the beneficent, the merciful, to Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth.
He gives life and He takes it away.
He has power over all things.
(whispering): Mr. President, can I have a moment?
If you're going to draw the American into a land war, we need to double... triple the number of our troops.
We'll be strong enough when the time comes.
And we have God on our side.
Greetings, children.
Salaam alaikum.
: Wa alaikum as-salaam.
Do you see these brave young men?
They're serving God.
Who else would like to serve God in his army?
It's the highest honor.
Does anyone know any mujahideen?
Ah, yes, Sheik.
My brothers.
I have two, Baka and Taj.
That's wonderful, wonderful.
: We lost them temporarily.
They went inside that building over there.
But they're still inside?
Maybe, but we don't know for certain.
There are tunnels and many exits, but, yes, they may be inside.
You're certain this is a training camp?
Absolutely certain. Do you see that?
That's a cache of Chinese CQ rifles.
And there... mortar launchers covered in tarp.
General, you agree?
Yes, sir, it's a terrorist training camp.
Do we have the go-ahead?
: Yes.
(sighs)
Yes.

A man returned to Abuddin a few days before I was to marry Jamal.
He came for the wedding.
I was in love with him since I was a girl.
He came to see me... and we were...
We were together.
The man you told me about?
You're that man's son.
He doesn't know.
Jamal never knew it.
I couldn't tell anyone while he was alive.
But now that he's dead...
That can't be true.
After you were born, I couldn't get pregnant again.
For two years, Jamal and I tried.
We went to a fertility clinic.
It was him.
His sperm.
Why do you think you never had any brothers and sisters?
I told him it was me.
But what about Rami?
He wasn't Jamal's son.
You'd have to ask his mother why she lied.
A measure of revenge, I suppose.
