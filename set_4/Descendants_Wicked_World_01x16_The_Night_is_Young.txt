It's time for the crowning of the Neon Lights King and Queen! Ben and Evie!
Oh, the jewels on the crown totally match my eyes! I look so good! I don't even need a filter!
I know I'm new to the whole crown thing, but I don't think plastic jewels are supposed to poke you in the skull.
Beauty is pain.
And I'm gorgeous.
I know. I really am.
And now, we invite our King and Queen to do a solo dance!
Dance for me. I've got a date with some bling.
Oh, crownie, I love you!
Did my queen just dump me for fake jewelry?
She sure did, but, hey! You gotta admit they do make a lovely couple.
They do, but I can't let "crownie" outdance me.
Shall we?
We shall!
It's tough.
Where is the music?
Maybe it's a really slow slow dance?
Excuse us.
Lonnie, what's going on?
I don't know what happened.
Nothing's working.
Someone cut the equipment cord!
Uh, we're having some technical difficulties.
Please hold.
Someone cut the DJ cord!
What?
Who?
Uh, don't worry.
I'll sing for you. No, really, I mean it.
No, no, no, guys, I insist. I got this.
Seriously. Go on.
Dance.
Um, from what I see, it looks like Freddie's kinda saved the party.
I don't know why you, guys, are throwing your shade.
Shade?
Throwing shade is like... talking trash with your eyes, darling.
Like this.
I know what it means.
I just wanted to see if you did.
Don't you think it's kinda strange that right after the DJ cord was cut, she jumped in, all ready to sing?
Maybe she wanted to help?
Or... maybe she wanted the spotlight?
I bet she cut the DJ cord.
You'd better stop trash talking before you cut a vocal cord.
Hey! Whose side are you on anyway?
The side that writes songs that good.
I smell something viral. Go on, girl!
Hit it, Lonnie.
