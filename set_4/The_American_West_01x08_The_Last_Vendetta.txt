: 
In the years since the country was ripped apart by Civil War, America has blazed a trail west, but it hasn't been easy. As the railroads cut across the landscape, they triggered bloody conflicts with Indian nations and became targets for outlaws.
Stay in your seats. Do not move.
: 
This is my brother, Robert, the one I told you about.
: 
What do you want?
I want my $3,600.
: 
(gunfire)
(theme song playing)
: 
: 
 are hearing how Ike's out to kill them and that Ike and his friends have guns.
 the cowboys who are half-drunk, all right, you got a recipe for disaster.
And that's really what happens.
Give us your guns.
(clicks)
Throw up your hands!
You boys wanna fight, we'll give you a fight.
I'm not gonna ask again.
: 
And if something is allowed to escalate to the point where people are actually reaching for weapons, 
: 
: 
 and only one man was unhurt, and that was Wyatt Earp.
: 
: 
It's a tale of unbelievable lawlessness.
: 
: 
They bring charges of murder against the three Earp brothers and Doc Holliday.
: 
I don't believe Wyatt Earp ever woke up in the morning and said, "I'm gonna go kill someone today."
And eventually people are gonna wanna go after him.
They don't want us here, they don't want us.
What do you recommend that we do?
A lot of folks are moving to California.
Maybe we should, too.
No. It'll look like they're running us right out of town.
That's right.
We're not going anywhere.
If we leave Tombstone, it's on our own terms.
This is where we belong.
Here's to the unflappable Wyatt Earp.
To Tombstone.
: To Tombstone.
(glasses clink)
: 
: 
He was gonna rob the Platte City Bank.
You know, it's something that's publicized.
We gotta be careful.
We have to look after each other.
: 
: 
You don't remember a lot of things, Morgan.
: 
: 
And those financial investments have just started to make some money.
But the Cowboys weren't letting it go.
(thunder rumbling)
: Virgil.
All right, let me show you how it's done.
I'm waiting to see it.
Because you're my brother, I'm gonna be easy on you, all right?
So what you want is...
(gunshot)
Wyatt.
Somebody call a doctor.
Morgan.
Morgan.
Oh, God.
: 
: 
This was the moment of change for Wyatt.
Wyatt...
You going soft on me, Doc?
No, sir, I am not.
This is for my brothers.
Lead the way, sir.
: 
I think one of the things we have to understand about Wyatt is that he was capable of impulsive violence.
And Wyatt's reaction is just as planned and just as premeditated.
You give me a name, and I'll let you live.
You go to hell.
You first.
: 
 the other side of the law, it was really about revenge.
 then it had to be taken in the hands of certain individuals.
: 
Pick it up.
: 
: 
You the governor?
And you must be Robert Ford.
You see this $1 coin, Mr. Ford?
Well, that's you.
But this $10,000 coin, that's Jesse James.
A good gambler could turn that one dollar into 10,000.
Are you a good gambler, Mr. Ford?
I want the reward and immunity for me and my brother.
Kill Jesse James and you'll get the money.
: 
: 
But there was a real fear with Bob Ford.
You know, "I'm a little afraid of Jesse James."
: 
: 
"What was Jesse James thinking trusting the Fords?"
 as well as a lot of cash by putting a bullet in his head.
This is gonna be the best one yet, boys.
Easy money.
: 
And I think that that's what happens to Jesse James.
Jesse, your breakfast is getting cold.
No!
I'm not done yet.
Zee... thank you.
I'm gonna go check on those horses.
That farmer's out on his porch.
You probably don't wanna walk around with that gun on your hip.
Hmm.
Yeah.
(clicks)
We gotta go.
We gotta go. Come on.
: 
(sobbing) No.
No!
Jesse James is shot in the back of the head by one of his own gang.
(sobbing)
: 
You know, Jesse James is already a her to many people.
Had he been captured, been tried, and had he been executed, it would have been much different.
 who shoots his leader in the back of the head.
: 
: 
 in the American imagination... as a hero, as a martyr 
But I grew up in Jesse James country.
When I was a kid, Jesse James was a hero.
 which was a tragic consequence of an awful, awful institution.
: 
: 
 truly cut their own path.
And I think that that's why we always idolize Jesse James.
I think there's a place in America's heart for those people.
: 
: 
: 
But there was no law and order, and usually the guys that kept the order, the Wyatt Earps of the world, 
Come on.
Whoa.
(nickering)
Saddle 'em up.
: 
: 
He's got holes all through his jacket.
Gets his man and leaves without a bullet hole once again.
: 
: 
This guy running around, shooting people in cold blood?
This isn't justice."
: 
: 
 and disbanded the posse and escaped Arizona, where things were getting mighty hot for him.
: 
: 
What people find appealing about the Wyatt Earp myth, what always shows up in most of the films, 
: 
But he winds up getting himself into one situation after another.
And so we have this kind of myth of Wyatt Earp as being the guy who just did it on his own.
: 
(whistle blows)
(whistle blowing)
: 
That has to be the most hopeless feeling in the world, to know that your land is now gonna look like that in about 50 years.
And if you're alive in 50 years, that's probably what you're going to be living in.
: 
: 
If you do these rituals, you can make time go backwards.
 and Indian peoples would be restored to their former prominence.
: 
: 
 are difficult to get to and so, seemingly, the reservation authorities decide, "Instead we'll arrest Sitting Bull 
 a recently created Lakota police force.
: 
Lower your weapon.
I will not go!
: 
: 
We had faith in one man, and he's doing everything he can to keep you alive and to keep your way of life alive and to protect you, and he dies a violent death instead of a natural death.
: 
 from non-hostile Indian, is they basically decide, "Well, anyone who's off the reservation is potentially hostile, and we'll treat them this way."
: 
 into the encampment at a rate of 50 shots a minute.
 against a community that was not in any way clearly, um, violent towards the United States.
: 
I think Wounded Knee was so devastating that it really did kill the spirit of a lot of people because they were fighting something 
: 
: 
 they fought to the end.
And, of course, eventually, the end did come.
: 
You know, we're actually to a point now where we can survive and thrive, so we need to do that 
And we fought and died to keep our way of life, and we still have it.
: 
: 
Before 1860, if you went West, you dropped out of sight, and people couldn't hear from you.
: 
: 
Was that good for you?
That was perfect.
: 
: 
So, you know what they say, his history belongs to the victors.
: We used to drive cattle into Dodge City that would stretch as far as the eye can see.
Thousands of cattle coming into town.
Just trample everything in their path.
: 
: 
 then the legacy will be the one that he wants remembered.
And in a lot of ways, that's exactly what happens.
First day on the job?
Yes, sir.
I'm a big admirer of yours, Mr. Earp.
: 
: 
 of this country's evolution, it's sense of it's identity, 
: 
(woman screams)
: 
: 
A lot of Americans could imagine, "Boy, if things had been different, I could be as bold and brave as daring as Jesse James or as Billy the Kid.
: 
 in a way nothing else has ever done.
And it really is that eternal American figure, 
: 
I believe that it is truly American 
 we've populated a nation that is now and always has been one of the great experiments in history.
