You're stepping on my toes, just like last time.
Sorry, not a lot of couples dancing on the Isle of the Lost.
Why don't I just step on yours and we'll call it even?
Ow!
I couldn't resist.
You just look so cute when you're in pain.
Jordan? Carlos?
I'm Jay. That's Jordan.
Oh, man. Why do I always do that?
Hallo! You've known me ever since stabbing me in jousting class when we were, like, 4. And you still can't get my name right.
Come on. How many boys do you know named "Jordan"?
Um, actually...
Hi, guys.
Thanks for picking us up... 3 hours ago.
We didn't pick you up.
I was being sarcastic.
I didn't even get that!
Living in Auradon is really messing with me.
Yeah. Where were you, guys?
We got carpet jacked!
What?
That doesn't happen in Auradon!
Apparently, it does.
We were really worried about you, guys.
I wasn't.
Sorry. Do honest.
What happened? You look rough.
I mean, even more than you usually do.
I didn't have the chance to pick up my tux.
And it was awesome.
White with giant black Dalmatian spots.
I was gonna look dog-mazing.
That is a tragedy.
I know, right?
Uh, I was talking about the tux.
She's kinda right.
Not having to see you in that tux is worth the carpet getting stolen.
I know. Good one.
So who did it?
I don't know! We were getting ready to head out and the rug was pulled from underneath our feet!
Literally!
Seemed fitting.
So, you never saw who did it.
Hey! Isn't that the mascot?
Oh, good. Jane found it.
Found what?
Jane?
That's me.
You're not in the mascot uniform!
Uh, yeah. 'Cause this is a formal night.
And besides, how could I be in my mascot uniform?
It was stolen, remember?
But if you're not in it, then who is?
Guys, it's okay!
I'm sure there's an explanation for why...
What?
Hey, let me go!
Ben?
Where did he go?
Ben?
Ben!
Ben!
We need search music.
Ben!
Whoa.
Does the concept "divide & conquer" not exist here in Auradon?
I don't understand. How can he just disappear?
I don't know.
Did you do this?
Seriously?
Why would you even ask that?
Well, Ben did magically disappear and Mal does have magic, so...
So what?
So you could have done this.
Why would I make my boyfriend disappear?
Maybe it's part of your plot.
My plot?
Oh, you know. To take over Auradon and other evil things.
And why would I do that?
Because you're VK.
I turned my mom into a gecko for you, people.
What else do I have to do to prove myself?
Hi! Sorry to interrupt.
No, I'm not.
CJ Hey, Malsie. Miss me?
Oh, I was going to give up dramatic entrances.
So flashy.
But... what can I say? I'm hooked.
I don't understand what's going on, but here's some pirate music.
Let me get this straight, you, guys, know each other?
CJ's captain Hook's daughter.
Oh. Well, that does explain the seaweed stench.
That's rotting culp(?).
Great! Another VK.
Okay, I'll stop.
