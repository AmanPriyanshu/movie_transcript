Back in 2012, I was a journalist.
I worked for the local paper in a city called Auburn, Alabama, in east central Alabama.
I'd lived there ten years.
But this morning, I had to say good-bye to being a career woman in the city.
Hey, honey.
Hey.
Just gonna get Gracyn strapped in, and we should be ready to go.
You go with Daddy; get in that truck.

This job was going to be my chance.

Had to make some sacrifices, but we were very excited.
