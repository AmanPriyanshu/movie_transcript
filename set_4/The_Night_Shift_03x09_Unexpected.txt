Okay. What do we got?
Patient called 9-1-1 for acute onset worst headache of life.
Nausea and visual changes.
B.P.'s 147/89, heart rate's sinus, tach in the 120s.
Help me. Everything's blurry.
I-I... My hand is numb.
Okay, possible aneurysm.
Let's go straight to C.T., and then I'll tap her.
Wait, I have a backpack. Don't worry.
No, I came in with a red backpack.
The medics will bring it right in. Don't worry about it.
You need to go back to the exam room, Mr. Neville.
Hey, I like how you look in those scrubs.
Thank you. But we bring the test to you.
I don't want you to put anything up my bottom.
We'll try not to.
I just need you to go back and sit and wait for me.
I'll wait for you all night!
Okay.
Great. Fine.
UhUh, Actually... Whoa. Um...
Over there.
Oh, yeah. Just... getting my bearings.
Okay. Right there.
Can we stay out here a little longer?
I hate being stuck in my room.
I know you do. It's just what's best for you.
But here, I do have something for you.
Something even better than a parking lot full of sun?
I don't think so.
Hmm? Don't be so sure.
What... Is that...
Turkish Delight.
Just don't go selling out to the Ice Queen like Edmund.
Never.

You can have some after your percussion therapy.
You gotta wait for me, though.
Not now? Man.

We are on strike, honey.

In her underwear.

The hospital promised us raises three years ago and still hasn't followed through.
And they always have us working shorthanded.
Do you have anything to do with this?
I do not, ma'am. No way.
In fact, they're the real bosses. Don't forget that.
We're all on your sides. Good luck.
Thanks, Drew.
: Bye, guys.
: All right.
Hey, Bri.
Hey, Dr. Toph.
Hey.
[Siren wailing]
And what do you want?
You could catch more flies with honey, Mollie.
Oh, so now I'm supposed to provide you honey?
I just need you to tell me where the EKG paper is and the handheld urinals.
[Laughs] Ask the scabs you called in to replace us.
Throw me a bone, ladies.
Only two scabs have shown. We're on the same side.
We're all getting screwed by the hospital.
Some of us are getting screwed just a little bit more, Toph.
Yeah.
Come on. It's the patients getting screwed now.
You're really gonna go there? You're gonna put that on us?

You need to take those handheld urinals and shove them straight up your...

Okay, I need you to draw a rainbow on Mr. Neville and get it to the lab stat.
Absolutely.
Um, where are the I.V. start kits and the saline bags?
Yeah, uh, they're in the supply chest down the hall.
Which supply chest?
And where's the lab?
Should I be taking notes?
Uh, never mind. Never mind. Uh, Shannon.
Can you draw blood on Mr. Neville?
Yeah, but, uh... shoot.
What?
Paul. Over there.
So?
So I sort of slept with him.
What?
I already regret it, so a little less shock would be appreciated.
How did this even happen?
A little vulnerability, maybe some hormones.
But now he's gonna get all weird and clingy and maybe even cry in front of me.
I mean, you know him, and I really don't need that this morning, so...
Hey.
Hey.
Mm, seems fine.

Man, be cool.
Yeah, I just... I don't want her to think that I'm not interested, you know, because I am.
I mean, like, really interested.

I'm gonna text her and explain...

Give me your phone.

Right, exactly. You got it.
Okay.
So... so keep it cool, man. Trust me.
I promise you, it works. All right?
Right.
Can I talk to you, Kenny? Privately?
Yeah.
I might need my phone, though.
Hey, you... you know I was just playing, right, Joce?
Yeah, I don't care about that. That's after hours.
But right now, you're our union liaison.
We've walked out and you're walking in?
Oh, no, I'm not here to nurse. No, I'm here for Lauren.
You know, she's the...
The high school soccer star I've been training.
She's been sick for weeks. She might have pneumonia.
She has practice, then school, practice, and so this is the only time she could come by.
There are other people here to help.
The scabs? Oh, no, no, no. No, no.
No, she's come way too far to get lost in the shuffle.
There's a recruiter coming on Thursday.
She's got a shot to be the first in the family to go to college.
But she's gotta be on, not sick.
I heard that. And I'm not sick.
I'm just feeling a little tired 'cause you work my ass into the ground.
I only give you what I know you can handle.
Mm.
Okay, well, I get it.
So get her checked in and get your butt outside on the line.

Nah, it's just some work stuff. Mm-hmm.

It's just work stuff? That's cool.

Oh, under the counter in the box marked "EKG paper."
Have you seen Paul?
No.
[Sighs] We need to get our nurses back.
Tell management, not us.
Yeah, we did.
Management's taking their own sweet time with negotiations.
Okay, has anybody seen my patient?
I dropped her off in C.T. five minutes ago.
She went to go get her backpack.
Sorry, you let a patient that came in, in an ambulance walk out of the E.R.?
Oh. I-I, uh...
To get the backpack that's right there at your feet?
Oh, jeez.
The paramedics must've brought that in.
I-I'll go take it back to her.
Where's the john?

He's not the one who saved me.
You.
You were the one.
You should've just let me die.
I can only imagine what you felt.
You can never imagine!
Losing a child?
A husband?
[Crying] He was my best friend.
I didn't want to live then and I don't want to live now.

No! No, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

Stop!
Aah!

It was my dream more than anything.

Nothing. Just...  [Inhales deeply]
You're just like my dad.
Your dad?
Yes.
[Laughs] He tells the same stories over and over again.

What's not you?
[Sighs]
There are a lot of things I'm gonna miss because of my leg, but soccer isn't one of them.
I hate soccer.
No.
Are you serious?
[Laughs] Despise it.
I've been playing 350 days out of the year since I was 6.
No weekends, no fun.
Just... [Sighs] train, train, train so I can get that scholarship and get into college.
But...
I don't know. I guess that's all over now.
[Sighs]
No, it's not.
Look, Lauren...  [Sniffles]
Okay. Hey...
You are the most positive, hard-working person I've ever met.
You're telling me that... that if you turn that... that focus, that... that energy to your... To your college applications, you don't think... you don't think you'll get a scholarship?
Hmm?
I got a recommendation letter in me you wouldn't believe.
And sadly, you... you got your college essay right here.

Mm.

Don't be sad, Drew. It's okay.
I know there's a plan for me.
Yes, there is.
And I'm all over it.
You're on every donor list in the country.
I check 'em every day.
No.
What I mean is...
I've always heard that when you die, you go to a better place.
Gotta say, I've been in and out of a dozen foster homes, had cystic fibrosis and, uh, now I need a lung transplant.
So if I go... it's gotta be to a better place than this, right?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I've read enough about lung transplants, Drew.
They just don't happen.
Could you read to me?

Oh, let's not talk about Mr. Neville's scrotum.
