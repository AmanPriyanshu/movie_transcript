There's a depressed defect on the temporal and parietal bones on the left side, and within the defect, there are two circular penetrating wounds that reveal cerebral tissue, and it would've taken a lot of force to do that.
Well, you know, our suspect had practice with the weapon.
He'd be capable of it.
Is your suspect left-handed or right-handed?
I'd have to get back to you on that. Why?
Well, because the angle of impact is consistent with a face-to-face attack, and if her injury was on the left side of her head...
Our killer is likely right-handed.
Yeah.
It's not absolute.

Yes! Two fractured ribs, directly beneath the sternum, consistent with chest compressions.

Judging by the way he flings his sword around, I'd say left.

Absolutely.
Thank you for your support, neighbor.

Dana? Honey?

Liz. You shouldn't be here.
I've been thinking about it.
You need to leave this house.
What?
Come with me.
Let's just... Let's just go, right now.
I don't think I can do that.
Rachel, what he's doing is illegal.
You can report him.
I love him.
What he's doing isn't love.
: Who's here?
Liz? I didn't know you two had plans.
I just stopped by to say hello.
And you've done that, so I think it's time to ship out, sailor.
[Slam]
I want your cell phone. Now.
I didn't know...
Shh! Shh!
Chop chop.
You will get this back when your judgment improves.

Rachel?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.
And you can come with me.
I found a safe place for us to go, but we need to leave.
Oh, honey.
I know it's been a hard time for you.
God is truly testing you right now, but it's when times are toughest, we need our faith most, and our family.
Family sees us through thick and thin, for better or worse.
No. You're not listening to me.
I think that he has done something terrible.
Enough.
You just need to stop thinking about yourself.
It would destroy him if you left.
So...
No more talk about leaving, okay?
You just remember who loves you most.
Now... unpack that, and I'll keep this between the two of us.

[opens drawer]
Hey.
Oh!
Is it already that time?
Afraid so.
[sighs heavily]
I figured I'd go to the airport early, you know, take full advantage of the first-class lounge.
Interpol flies you first-class?
Of course.
It's Interpol.
Mm.
This is how we're saying goodbye?
Hey, hey, hey.
You have a case. I totally understand.
I know, but it's...
[computer dings]
Oh. [whacks key]
Forensics just matched Seth Armstrong's prints from the pen to prints in Liz's apartment.
So Seth was definitely at the crime scene.
Yeah. Means he lied to me.
Listen, the Armstrong house is on the way to the airport.
Want a ride?

You do know I don't speak French, right?
You don't need to.
Are they going to expect that?
No need, no need.

He saw us.

I don't even know what side of the road they drive on over there.
Well, I do. On the right.
Are you sure about that?
I'm positive.
Hard right, hard right, hard right!

[Seth cries out and groans]
: Okay, far enough.
Hey, idiot.
Gate's open.
: Get up!
Get up.
Seth Armstrong, you're under arrest.
I think you're gonna have to take a cab to the airport.
All right, dumb-dumb.
Mind your head.
Whoo! Okay.
Angelica Flynn... you certainly know how to show a fella a good time.
[chuckling]
I aim to please.
[door opens and shuts]
Okay.
Why am I here? I'm innocent.
Then why'd you run?
I only had a few questions to ask you.
Can I ask you now?
You can ask.
So...
Were you sleeping with Liz?
Don't be disgusting.
She had a lot of lovers. Did that bother you?
She bothers me.
What about her?
Exactly?
Her lifestyle choices?
Her relationship with Rachel?
Don't bring Rachel into this.
She has nothing to do with this.
Actually, I think she had everything to do with it.
Rachel doesn't need this.
She doesn't need you filling her head with your crazy ideas.
You mean ideas?
She's not like you.
Just stay out of her life.
You can't tell me what to do.
Stay away from my family.
No. Rachel is smart, and she's kind and she's just figuring out who she wants to be.
She deserves more than you.
She deserves a life.
I love Rachel.
You love the fact that you have power over her.
You're sick.
I don't have to listen to this.
If you really love her like you say you do, let her go.
I know about your arrangement.
She told me all about it.
You're going to let her go.
That's not gonna happen.
Well, let's just see what the police have to say.

This is your last chance.

You can make as many accusations as you want.
You don't have any proof.
I have this.
That's Rachel's.
Found it at Liz's apartment.
There's three sets of prints on it...
Yours, Rachel's, Liz's.
I was there. So what?
Why'd you lie?
Because I knew that you would assume the worst, which is exactly what you did.
What were you doing there?
[Exhales heavily]
To confront Liz about filling Rachel's head with nonsense.
Right, but... as far as we know, Liz was only encouraging Rachel to go to school.
Now, what parent doesn't want that for their child?
: You coddle her too much.
She's not a child anymore.
And I know it's because you love her. Hmm?
You love us both.
There were blood stains on your shirt.
I managed to bleach them out.
I had a nose bleed.
: Don't lie to me, Seth.
You killed that girl.
Why?
Why do you think?
To protect our family.
Rachel will never find out.
♪
I love you.
Rachel is delicate.
She's special.
Mm-hmm.
When we first brought you in, I ran a background check on you, so I know that Rachel is not your daughter.
Don't bother lying.
I know she's your wife.

Mm-hmm. Three-year position.

What do you think?
I think a Homicide Department without Angie Flynn?
I know, it's hard to imagine, isn't it?
Yeah. I think the question is, can you even imagine it?
Maybe.
Well... hey.
Hey.

New beginnings.
