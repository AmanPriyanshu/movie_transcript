I know what this is.
You're blowing me off, right?
I'm  sorry.
I like you.
I just can't do it.
You gonna live your whole life this way?
I want to get into that cage, knock some rust off, you know?
Do you still like me?
I'm gonna be coaching Ryan.
Joe's gonna take care of you.
You have full reign of the gym, so long as Ryan's not here.
So I got to work around him?
You're my son. I love you.
I gotta look at you as a fighter. It's a business decision.
Who the f*ck is she?
I met her in rehab.
Why is she here?
Just a night or two...
She has no place to go.
Please, I need you.
The team doesn't work without you. I want you to comeback.
So then, what?
I'm seeing someone.
Who?
You know, the lawyer...
I'm not gonna stop seeing her.
Can you leave? I just wanna be alone.
(ALVEY SIGHS)
(OBJECT SCRAPING)
Shoo!
(SIGHS) What are you doing?
Hi.
Hey.
Lisa's back in L.A.
A few things I haven't told you.
Come sit down.
When we were splitting up, she got pregnant.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
It was an accident.
We tried to make it work, and it was done.
She went back home to have the baby.
About, uh, 7 1/2 months in, she lost it.
Oh, my God. That's... That's awful.
I'm really sorry.
Look, this happened right before I met you.
You know, I didn't... I didn't know how to tell you this, and it was just too soon.
And then it was too late.
How is she?
I don't know.
She wants to come back to work, though.
I told her about us.
What did you say?
I said it was new, and I wasn't gonna stop.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
She wants to come back to the gym as a partner, 25%.
That's what you want?
I need her.
I really do.
Place runs better with both of us.
I just don't know if she's ready.

(LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS)
(SIGHS)
What are you doing today?
: I don't know.
I might just go back to sleep.
That's a good idea. You should do that.
Enjoy your Saturday.
I'd invite you to the fight, but it's Lisa's first night back.
I will happily not attend.
How are you feeling about all this?
You want to ask me anything?
(SIGHS)
What does she think is going on with you two?
She knows about us.
No, I know what you said to her, but what does she want?
Did she come back here just to work in the gym or is she expecting you to be together?
I really don't know.
I mean, it's okay if she is.
Obviously, I just met you, and you guys have a whole life together, so...
I respect that, and if you need space, you need me to back off, it's fine.
You just... You have to tell me.
I don't want you to back off.
Okay?
Well, maybe I should.
I don't want you to.
What do you want me to say?
Hmm?
I'm being straight with you.
I'm telling you everything here, okay?
I do not want this to end.
Okay?
Now, this woman's been through hell.
I got to be very gentle with her.
That's not what I meant. I just...
f*ck. Bullshit.
What?
I feel terrible for her, and... and for you, too.
I really do.
And I don't want to be... I don't want to be this woman.
You didn't do anything wrong.
I'm in her bed.
You're in my house, in my bed.
The thing with her and I had been over for a long time.
I told you that.
Ah, you don't have to say that.
I want you to know it.
I got to run.
(SMOOCHES)
Don't back off.

I'll see you later.

Thank you for not asking.
I'd like to transition to work for you, if that's cool.
Why? Is Alvey giving you a hard time?

I get it.

I'm sorry about your dad.
Well, we don't need to talk about that, either.
Fair enough.
I'm just glad you're back 'cause Alvey is not... management material.

I'm thinking forks, knives, probably some napkins.

Lisa is not your f*cking problem, okay?
Got nothing to do with you. Don't worry about it.
Yeah, I'm trying not to.
Try harder, okay?
Shut the noise out and focus. That's what a professional does.
That's what you're gonna do.

Oh, I'm sure you're sorry.

I don't know how you get out of f*cking bed.
Well, I'm stitched together with a lot of good pills, so that helps.
Well, any of these pills you're taking...
Are they the sort of thing that Jay might enjoy?
No, you little sh1t.
If you have a few extras... I'm saying...
No, and actually, I've been hearing some really gnarly crap about you.
Well, those claims are greatly exaggerated.
Are you living at a f*cking hotel?
No.

What else did they take?
They took the TV, your Xbox, a whole bunch of sh1t.
I don't know. It's a mess, man.
(SIGHS)
Want a drink?
Have one.
: I'll have a double.
(GRUNTS)
(SIGHS)
Thank you.
To panic attacks.
(CHUCKLES)
And insomnia.
And depression.
Mm-hmm.
And rage and loss.
Mm.
And self-loathing.
(CHUCKLES) That's not me. That's you.
Yeah.
But, um, bitterness?
I like it. I like it.
Yeah?
Hopelessness?
Oh, f*ck. I'm swimming in that.
Yeah.
Here's to all the f*cking pills that make the pain go away.
God bless.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
And f*ck you, God.
(CHUCKLES) Right.
I know you think that, um, I f*cking lied to you.
No.
I am not a basket case, I promise you.
I know that that's the last thing that Alicia needed before she went out for a fight, and it will not happen again.
I know, I know, I know. Lisa, Lisa, we made a deal.
You're part of the f*cking gym.
Okay? This doesn't change anything.
It's gonna take a little bit of time to get back to normal.
Everybody understands that.
Mm.
It didn't take you long.
That's not a dig.
It's just he wasn't real to you.
That's not fair.
I know it's not fair.
It's f*cking bullshit.
But my doctor told me that, uh, men don't know how to grieve this.
It's not your fault.
I'm f*cking hurting.
I am. I wanted this.
He wasn't inside you.
Are we really done?
Don't you think?
No. That's not what I thought.
Really?
I mean, let's be f*cking honest with each other.
You... You weren't happy.
Well, it felt better than this.
I f*cking hate you.
I want to rip off your face, throw it in the f*cking toilet, flush it.
Do you want to stay the night?
(LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS)
Jesus Christ. Really?
Yeah. I don't want to be alone.
I got to make a phone call.
(RINGING)
: Hi.
Hey. Where are you?
I'm having a glass of wine on your patio.
Where are you?
Are you with her?
Uh...
She had a little panic attack at the fight, so I took her back to the hotel.
Uh... she asked me to stay.
I really can't f*cking leave her alone.
No. No, you can't do that.
You'd be an asshole if you did that.
Yeah.
Look, I wasn't up-front with you.
You know, I-I-I understand if you don't want to stick around.
I usually don't.
I'm just gonna go back to my place, okay?
I'll call you tomorrow.
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm just grabbing some extra clothes.
Why don't you just come home?
You're not hurt, right?
No.
You're okay?
Mm-hmm.
Okay. Then I'm gonna go.
Nate's here. You're all right.
(SHAKILY) Jay.
I'm not mad at you.
But this isn't my job.
I can't help you every single time.
You know?

Hi. You've reached Will Casady at the Burns Agency.
Please leave a detailed mess...
38 hours.
What was?
I had to deliver him.
I labored for 38 hours, and I never heard him cry.
