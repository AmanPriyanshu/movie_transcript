Normally I prefer more of a cramped lampshade environment But this place is also a fave.
Thanks.
Wicked dress! You're gonna look so great tonight.
Oh, so are you. I'm sure your dress will be amazing.
This is my dress.
I know!
And I... love it!
Nice one. She totally didn't get that you don't love it.
Has anyone ever told you that you're a really bad whisperer?
No, they totally haven't.
Guys, guys! Emergency!
Is someone hurt?
No.
Ooh, is someone really hurt?
No!
Oh, my web series broke 1 million subscribers?
How would that be an emergency?
Oh, is there an emergency?
Somebody stole my dress!
It's okay. Everyone just calm down.
This is why I always bring a back-up gown.
And back-up accessories.
Hmm, do you have anything a little less... puncture-prone?
And back-up de-accessories!
You know, for a VK look, it's actually pretty cute.
I'm sold!
Ta-da!
Wow, how did you change so fast?
Seriously, one second you're wearing one dress and then you're wearing the other. It was like... out of a cartoon.
My mum was raised by fairies.
Quick outfit change is a family skill.
When I was a baby, I could change my own diaper in two seconds flat!
Thank you for that visual.
Thank you, Evie. You're a life-saver.
Oh, I've been called worse.
Oh, that's so sweet.
That's so sweet.
This deserves a celebration.
Tea me.
Oh, my dress!
Don't look at me!
I'm not the one that always makes a mess of everything.
You, you did this!
What? No, of course, not!
Why would I do that? I-I love your dress!
That's why you destroyed it.
You're jealous! You VKs can't stand it if someone looks better than you!
She has a point.
No, she doesn't.
Allie, I swear I didn't do this.
But I promise I can fix it.
I think.
Dress, dress, away from this mess, rid this gown of its distress!
Okay, don't freak out! Yet.
Dress, dress, I must express, make this gown a bit to impress!
Wait! I actually really like it.
You do? You're just saying that.
No, I mean it. It's really... alternative.
Alternative to what?
She means it's very fashion-forward.
If I didn't think I was already wearing the best dress, I'd be super-jelie.
But I do, so I'm not.
You know what? I think it's cool too.
Really?
Even the Queen of Hearts herself would be jealous of that number.
I would totally feature that on my web show.
VK gone viral.
It is kind of funky.
Oh, yeah. Funky!
That's what I was going for, you know, 'cause that's why they call me the funk master! The funk-munko, funky town.
Quit while you're ahead.
Good call.
Well, I guess the roses aren't the only thing being painted red!
I'll take it.
"VKs gone viral"?
Isn't it interesting that we both ended up with a little villain edge for a party look? Maybe a little too interesting.
