You're not going to win the Nationals at freestyle.
I think you can win the butterfly.
We're both going to the Nats, and when we get there, we're going to smash it. Deal?
Yeah.
He's going to do it!
He's going to qualify.
Bad luck.
That was a solid swim alright.
At the wall, they make a plunge.
Ladies and gentlemen, a world record.
Yes!
You broke the world record!
You f*cking did it!
I did it for you.
See ya, Kelly.
If you want to represent your country, if you want to be an Olympian, then you need us.
Steph, he's here. He's here!
Hello!
What's going on?
Nothing, just happy to see you.
It came.
Oh, ssh!
Come on, open it!
Can YOU do it?
(SCREAMS)
You made it, you made it, you made it!
He made it - we made it - for the Australian squad.
Kuala Lumpur, here we go!
I'm going to throw up!
I knew it, I knew it!
Congratulations.
Put it on.
Oh, wow!
Come on, give us a twirl.
Look, it's got 'Australia' on the back.
Congratulations.
I'm going to the Commonwealth Games!
(CLUB MUSIC BOOMS)
Oi! This is the Barracuda.
He just got into the Australian swim team for Kuala Lumpur.
Is that right?
I'm on the Australian team, yeah.
Nice to meet you. Let's have a shot.
The Barracuda!
Well, here's to swimming like a fish and drinking like a fish.
Cheers.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Told you.

(BLOWS WHISTLE)
What's wrong with you?
I'm feeling slow.
You getting enough sleep?
Forget it.
Hey! Forget what?
What does that mean, "forget it", hm?
Hey!
You want to test yourself?
OK, then. 50 at race pace, on my whistle. You ready?
(BLOWS WHISTLE)
What did I swim?
You're getting closer.
You have to clear your mind, Danny.
BOY: Well done, mate.
Thanks.
Yeah, well done, mate.
Thank you.
Congratulations, Danny.
Thanks.
Kelly.
Hey, guys? I'm going to talk to Ben Whitter about coaching me.
I want to see what Vic Institute can offer.
What?
Have you spoken to Frank about it?
No, but...
Look, it's like he's run out of ideas what to do.
It's the same drills, over and over.
Theo, darling, very cute.
Can you take it off, please?
We're ready for dinner.
How do you know that Ben Whitter is going to be any different?
It's the Institute, Mum!
They win gold.
What's the big deal?
People change coaches all the time.
We're not that sort of people, son.
I swum 52.22 at the Nats.
You know what I'm swimming now?
55, 56.
What's Torma doing? Nothing.
If I stay loyal to him, I'll fail.
I can't take that risk.
(SIGHS)
Frank will understand.
But it's your decision.
If you come to VIS, Danny, you're in control.
You know your body better than anyone else.
We can provide all the support and technology for you, but ultimately, we just let you go for it.
I'll tell you what, though, I'm not going to hover over you like Frank Torma does.
Why would I? You're the one who smashed the world record.
Cool.
Now, have you ever seen yourself swim before?
No.
Well, in you get.
Michelle, let's turn the camera on.
Yeah.
Let's film the fastest butterflier in the world.
(START BUZZER)
There.
See, watch the left ankle as it comes out.
It's splaying on the left.
Can you see that?
I didn't know I did that.
We're going to pick up things like that.
What we would do is try and straighten it up, 'cause then you'll spend that millisecond more under the water, which means less drag.
What times have you been doing since the Nats?
I'm building.
Well, the Comm Games are in three months.
Well, don't worry about it.
If you join VIS, we'll get you faster than you're swimming now, maybe two or three seconds.
I'm going backwards.
I told you a dozen times before, it's no use doing overload this far out from the Games, it just feels that way.
How do you know?
You've never trained an Olympian.
(LAUGHS) You swim one good race and you think you're the expert, huh?
I'm the best athlete you've ever had.
OK, so what you going to do? You going to stand there and yell at me?
Go right ahead. It's not going to make you swim any faster.
The times are going to come, trust me.
Why should I? My times are sh1t.
I'm joining Vic Institute.
Ben Whitter invited me.
You know, Danny, I'm the one that found you at that Coburg pool, and I'm going to tell you what you were.
You were a skinny kid with an attitude and a sh1t technique.
And you are where you are because you have trained with me, because of me.
And I'll tell you something else - until you learn some humility, it won't matter who you train with, you're not going to win a f*cking thing.
Second 50. Set yourself up.
3, 2, 1, hit it.
At the last minute, you'll lift that hip up, and then pop forward.
Lift it up, and bang!
Ten seconds to go. Come on.
Charge right to the end.
2, 1.
(TIMER BEEPS)
1.5 down. That's not quite the world record.
It's your hips. You're getting sloppy. Keep them out of the water.
Up! Keep them up!
It's your sponsorship, Danny.
Already?
Yeah. Don't be surprised.
I've been doing this for 20 years.
You want my opinion?
I think you're a once-in-a-generation swimmer.
We're going to look after you here.
You're in the right place.
I'll leave you to it.
We need to talk about media too.
There's already interest.
I've never been interviewed before.
I hope I don't say anything embarrassing.
You look beautiful, Mum.
Thank you.
Oh, my God!
(CLEARS THROAT) Ready.
Let's go.
Hello.
Julia. Hi.
Hi, Julia.
Not too dressed up?
You look perfect.
Absolutely gorgeous.
Everyone looks gorgeous.
You happy just in here?
Yeah.
On the couch, Danny in the middle.
So, Danny, have you always loved swimming?
Yeah. Well, we didn't have a pool, but Dad would take me for lessons up in Coburg.
At what age?
Dad?
Two.
Water babies.
(LAUGHS) Oh! Priceless.
Yes. It was their special thing.
And Danny took straight to it, and he would...
I'm sorry.
Can I...
That's alright! Please go on.
Sorry. I'm getting all excited!
Um, fearless.
Went straight into the water, and all the other babies were crying, and he was just, like...
And do you remember what it was like when you first jumped into the water?
I remember the feeling of Dad actually holding me up in the water, just feeling safe.
And you're a long-distance truckie, Neal?
Proud member of the TWU.
That must have been hard, though, with your dad away a lot.
Yeah, but, you know, there's always been Mum.
Um...
..Danny's a great son and a great big brother.
How much are we getting paid for this?
Heaps, mate. Shush!
Actually, Danny was telling me earlier that Theo has a little bit of trouble with reading, dyslexia?
And Danny is really hands-on with his little brother's education.
Excuse me.
Are you going to print this?
Because...
I just think it's really refreshing, to see a young champion so down-to-earth and so dedicated to his family.
Oh, I couldn't have done this without my family.
My coach is great - Ben Whitter, from the Victorian Institute of Sport - but yeah, I mean, my family's my secret weapon.
They're who I swim for.
Alright, everybody, so, same as before, just looking at me.
There we go. Big, proud smiles.
3, 2, 1.
Great, OK. I'll get one with just Danny in for now.
Everyone else, you can go back inside.
And one. Great. One more.
Can I have a bit of a cheeky smile this time? 3,2 and...
(ALL LAUGH)
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
EMMA: I'll get it, Jenna.
Oh.
Hi.
I thought you were the cab.
I didn't know you were coming over.
I'm about to go and see a friend's play.
Sounds dire, but...
So why are you going?
'Cause she wants people to think she's an intellectual.
Should I have called?
(TAXI HORN BEEPS)
That's me.
I'll see you, Danny.
See ya.
You look like the swim shop.
Didn't cost me a cent.
They've got a little stripe.
The really gay ones.
Thanks. They've got the high-vis things on them as well.
When are the Games?
BOTH: September.
Good for you.
Nice to see dedication paying off.
How's the Institute going?
It's pretty intense.
I have to keep a diary to write down all my drills, 'cause it changes every day.
Oh!
Tailored training program.
That's very advanced.
So how does it work, do they pay you a wage?
Well, I get pool entry and gym, and I don't pay for coaching.
Make sure you make yourself some money, son.
Sporting careers never last very long.
Good one, Dad.
Sponsorships can be worth good money.
I know Kieren Perkins did well out of that cereal.
I think it sounds very professional.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I mean, Torma's a great coach...
I wish I could be sentimental about that man. The truth is...
No coach can make a champion if he doesn't have what it takes.
Martin gave him everything, he did nothing with it.
He's not good enough!
That's the problem.
I lost a race.
Get over it, both of you.
You sound just like your mother sometimes.
(PUTS MUSIC ON)
Why don't they just f*cking leave each other?
Come on, mate, you don't want that.
What was all that with Emma?
I don't know.
Maybe she likes me.
You know she's just messing with you, right?
I've seen it stacks of times before.
You sound jealous.
How does that comment even make sense?
Do you know what I miss about swimming?
That feeling when you dive in, and you can just block everything out...
..that peace.
I have to focus on training.
Darling, what about school?
That should be your first priority.
Swimming's my first priority.
What's the big deal?
Dad left school at 16.
Oh, you want to drive trucks now, do you?
We're actually talking about your future!
My future's now, Mum.
The Commonwealth Games are this year!
Pan-Pacs the next.
At the Sydney Olympics, I'll be 20.
I'll be peaking at the Olympics.
And your exams?
Every second I'm meant to be studying, I'm thinking about swimming.
You can't put all your eggs in one basket, Danny.
If I don't perform at KL, I'll always think, "Did I give it 100%?"
Danny, can you just take a deep breath?
You can defer and come back next year.
No! Next year's the Pan-Pacs.
Mum, how many years has it been?
How many mornings, how many meets?
And in all that time, I never once talked about giving up.
Alright, then, who's going to pay back the term fees?
If you leave school, it's seven grand.
I will, Dad, when I win.
I have to do this.
(LAUGHS)
I've got to give it to you, mate.
WOMAN: Hold it for 3, 2, 1.
MAN: Alright, everybody, 100 metres, I want full race conditions.
Keating, let's get that entrance right. Not too shallow.
Danny, you set yourself up.
That second 50, get yourself ready for it.
Danny, hips further out of the water!
Watch your breathing, watch your breathing.
I was thinking you might like someone to train with from your old swim team.
He said you're his inspiration.
Hey, bro. How are you?
Torma junked Scooter, Morello.
Brought in all these Year-8s.
I was freaking.
Then Mr Whitter said you needed a training partner, and I was, like, "Yes, please!" hey?
(LAUGHS)
I went to school with Barracuda.
We won the 4 by 100 in Albury together.
Look, I didn't ask you to come here!
Stay away from me.
(CARTOONS ON TV)
What the f*ck, Theo?
Where's Mum?
At the salon, double shift.
Where's Dad?
Adelaide, remember?
Who's looking after you?
(IMITATES) Who's looking after you?!
Theo!
This might sting a little bit, so be brave, OK?
Shut up!
It's nearly over.
Awesome! "No.1."
Something for the ego.
(LAUGHS)
Now you do me.
(SPITS) Yuck!
I don't get it. They have everything at this place, and...
(WINCES)
..my times are sh1t, and getting shitter.
That's not a real word!
Damn!
Oh, look - good place, good person, bad fit.
It happens.
I have to win!
And what if you don't?
Why would you say that?
Well, not everyone can win, Danny.
It's called mathematics.
You don't think I can.
I didn't say that!
Why are you so angry at me?
Maybe I'm sick of your sh1t.
Danny!
Look, I know you'll give it a hundred per cent, you always do, but that's all you CAN do.
Why would you say I can't win?
I'm the world-record holder!
What are you even doing here?
What's a supposed-to-be lesbian doing lying in my room with her tits out?
You don't think that's weird?
You break my heart, Danny.
I'm going to win!
(STOPWATCH BEEPS)
How are you feeling?
Anything you want to tell me, Danny?
How's home? Any girlfriend issues?
You f*cking promised me two seconds!
You watch your mouth.
f*ck off!
Hey, hey!
We are doing everything we can to get you those two seconds.
I'm scratching my head, wondering why you're still so slow.
Perhaps the world record was a fluke.
It wasn't.
Well, how are we going to show it?
f*ck you.
Three more, come on.
One more.
Hey! Ho!
Another peak for you, matey.
Well done, alright? Take it easy.
No damage, alright?
Yep.
f*cking fluked it, mate.
What did you say?
Huh?
What did you say, you think I fluked the world record?
Back off, psycho!
What did you call me?
Hey, hey, hey!
You! You get over there.
You, come here. Come here!
Walk away.
What the hell are you doing?
He gets on my nerves.
You do not lay hands on another athlete.
It is completely crossing the line, you hear me?
He's a dickhead!
A dickhead who's swimming a lot better than you right now.
I'm worse than when I came here.
And why is that, Danny?
This place. Since I've been at this pool, it's all been noise.
I used to want to get in the pool, but...
Yeah, what? Say it!
Now I hate it.
You hate it.
We've given you everything, Danny - top-level package, full gold treatment, but clearly, it's not working out for you.
Whatever you did with Torma to get that time at the Nationals, we can't replicate it.
What are you saying?
You're cutting me?
The Games are in a month.
That's why I'm telling you now.
You're a good kid, Danny.
Don't take it personally.
Hi.
Hi.
Regan!
You can't bin every copy, hon.
I will if I have to.
What's wrong?
Nothing, apart from them telling the world that Theo's a retard.
What?
"As the sound of sirens echo down the street, Danny Kelly opens the door to the modest family home he shares with his hairdresser mum and truckie dad."
Regan!
That didn't happen.
It gets better.
"Sitting on the threadbare couch, Mrs Kelly moves a pile of overdue electricity bills..."
(SPEAKS GREEK)
"..to proudly show pictures of the champion swimmer."
(SHOUTS IN GREEK)
That couch - my couch - is only two years old.
Come on.
(SPEAKS GREEK)
Mum!
(SLAMS DOOR)
Why'd they write that?
Because they always need a story, son, and their story is we're nothing and you're special.
Is Theo in his room?
Theo, it's me.
Do you want some new trainers?
I can get you some new trainers!
Trainers (!)
(KNOCKS) Theo!
THEO: Go away!
Look, I'm sorry.
You're a selfish prick, Danny.
I'm not selfish.
Do you even know how much extra work your mum has had to do, how many extra Ks I've been doing to pay back your school fees?
You wanted to quit school.
And I said I would pay for that.
You don't give a damn about anyone but yourself, you never have.
What about you? What have you ever given Regan or Theo?
All your bullshit about saving the world, what have you ever done for your own family?
Everything I do is for my family.
All I wanted was for you to support me.
You never once carried me, honoured me.
You never once supported me, did you?
You didn't want me to get too big-headed.
You didn't want me to succeed.
That's bullshit!
You didn't want me to be anything but what you are - a bitter old man with a chip on his shoulder about being working-class and poor!
Oh, sh1t, son!
Oh, sh1t. I'm sorry, son.
Hey...
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.
They kicked me out of Vic Institute.
What?
I've stuffed everything up.
I don't know what to do.
Come here.
It'll be OK, mate.
It'll be OK.
I can come in with you, if you want.
No, it's OK.
I'll catch the bus.
I never thought I'd have a kid as special as you.
Whatever happens, know that I love you, son.
I'll never stop believing in you.
Thanks, Dad.
Well done, Edvigo.
Go home and do your homework.
You can't stay here, I'm closing up.
Ben said he could get me two seconds faster.
I panicked.
I made a mistake.
I need you.
Why do you want to swim?
What do you mean?
I'm asking you why you even want to swim.
To win.
It's the only way I can give it back.
If we're going to do this, it can't be normal hours.
Early in the morning, late in the evening.
Thank you.
Tomorrow morning, 5am, Coburg pool.
Don't be late.
Hello, Danny.
Come with me.
You feel good?
Yeah.
Good.
Hey - tell me, what's this?
What are you doing?
I've got a new dolphin kick.
Dolphin kick?
You never needed more technique, OK?
You're an instinctive swimmer.
You don't need to think.
You let ME think.
Hey! Stop all this f*cking self-pity, alright?
You're the world-record holder, 100 metres butterfly, aren't you?
Aren't you?!
Yes.
Yes, Coach.
So listen to me.
Water is a wall, alright?
Now, it can break you or you can fly on it, it's up to you.
What's it going to be?
I'm the world-record holder for the 100-metre butterfly.
Yes, you are. And that means you are world's fastest swimmer.
Hm?
I need a break.
Is he done already?
What are you doing here?
I heard you were getting fat, and that I had a chance to beat you again.
Go on, then. You know what to do.
100 metres, freestyle. Let's go!
That's it, Danny - you feel the water.
Trust yourself. Remember - if it feels messy, it's messy.
I want you to block out all the noise, all the step tests, all the skin-fold bullshit, all of it.
I want you to stop thinking and swim like you did when I first saw you, like a barracuda.
I haven't done that in a while.
I'm rooted.
It feels good, swimming fast.
You know, you should come to Kuala Lumpur.
I'd like to.
Why don't you?
52.45.
No, with me.
Like a road trip, but you get to hang out at the Games.
Bagus, bagus!
It's Malaysian for 'good'.
I've been practising.
Come on!
Car, plane, car - there and back in three days.
Don't you have swot vac anyway?
What, just go watch you swim?
You and me, at the Commonwealth f*cking Games.
It's the way it should have been - you and me.
Look, I need you there.
I still wake up at four, you know. (LAUGHS)
Halfway out of bed before I realise.
That's right, that's over.
It doesn't have to be.
OK. (LAUGHS)
You'll come?
Yeah.
(GATE OPENS)
You boys are early.
You want to go?
Yeah.
(PHONE RINGS)
Yeah?
Oh. Hi, Emma.
It's Danny... Danny Kelly.
(LAUGHS) I know which Danny you are.
Is Taylor there?
No, he's out.
For a second, I thought you might have been calling for me.
I'm so bored, it's like I almost willed the phone to ring.
What are you doing?
Just packing.
I leave for Africa tomorrow.
Why don't you come over and say goodbye?
(POP MUSIC PLAYS)
I'm sure I'm forgetting something.
How's Martin?
He's over at Lauren's now.
Dad calls him 'the dearly departed'.
So are they pretty serious?
How do you ever know what Martin's really serious about?
Danny...
I've got to use the bathroom.
You've got a big heart, Danny.
Just... be careful with it.
(ALARM CLOCK BEEPS)
Call me, OK?
I will.
Right.
I don't think they use Australian money in Malaysia, Mum.
Yeah, OK! Reverse charges, any time.
Enjoy yourself.
Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Hopefully not!
Nice one, Dad.
You know what I mean.
Just take time to take it all in.
Don't wear my jeans.
Oh, piss off!
I'm going to bring you back some more gold, man.
You'd better.
Proud of you, son.
(MUFFLED TRAFFIC, TVs BLARE, PEOPLE TALK)
(FARTS)
(LAUGHS) Really?
(LAUGHS)
Sorry!
I can't sleep.
Yeah. Me too.
I hope we both get gold tomorrow.
I don't even want to think about it.
Nah, you're a shoo-in, mate.
Don't worry.
Look at this place.
Yeah.
It's a bit different than Melbourne.
Hey, um...
..I'm sorry for how I treated you.
I think I was just jealous.
You've got some real talent, man.
I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
Out.
(PHONE RINGS)
Hello?
Mrs Taylor?
Who's speaking?
It's Danny.
Oh, hi! Danny.
I'm sorry it's late.
No, no, no. It's not too late.
I haven't gone to bed yet.
How is it there?
Just...
Well, you know, it's pretty full-on.
There are cars everywhere, and you have to share a room.
I got Wilco. Can you believe it?
Is everything alright, Danny?
Where's Martin?
He said he was coming to KL.
Listen, Danny.
Martin isn't coming.
He, um... A family thing came up.
Oh.
Danny, tomorrow's YOUR day.
You've worked so hard your whole life for this.
Go try to get some sleep, OK?
Goodnight.
(CROWD CHEERS)
(ANNOUNCEMENTS ON PA)
MAN: Time to go.
(CHEERING)
(LAUGHS)
TV: Men's 100 metres butterfly, the championship...
Theo!
..with the gold medal up for grabs.
We've seen some great 100 butterflies in Commonwealth history.
(ANNOUNCER SPEAKS MALAY)
Ladies and gentlemen, waiting now at the starting platforms are the athletes for the men's 100-metre butterfly.
Commonwealth championship.
TV: Kuala Lumpur has been a happy hunting ground for the Australian team, and they're looking for another gold medal, perhaps even two swimmers on the podium here from Team Australia.
Brendan Pine is in there, as well as Daniel Kelly.
In lane 6, representing Canada, Patrick Connolly.
From the Republic of South Africa, swimming in lane 5...
There are certainly some good opportunities with Daniel Kelly, now the world-record holder, but they'll have to come over the top of the defending champion.
Swimming lane 3, the current Commonwealth Games champion, from Canada, Andrew Higgs.
In lane 2, the world-record holder...
And here is Daniel Kelly...
My boy, my boy, my boy!
..certainly the butterfly that's come up trumps.
What a nerve-racking experience for this young 17-year-old at his first Commonwealth Games.
..for the Commonwealth Games 100-metre butterfly championship.
Take your marks.
Set for a start now, the boys ready for the 100 metres butterfly final.
(ELECTRONIC BUZZ)
And they're off.
(COMMENTARY CONTINUES)
At the moment, it looks as though Daniel Kelly didn't have the best of starts, but nothing to panic about.
What's happening, Mum?
That's alright.
He did the same thing at the Nationals.
And still struggling to just maintain...
Come on, Danny.
Push, Danny!
Daniel Kelly, trying to make a comeback.
Come on, push!
Push, push, push, push, Danny!
Soft hands, Danny!
(CHEERING)
Come on, Danny!
(SQUEALS)
Starting to push down the front.
Yes!
Come on, Danny!
Push!
(CHEERING)
..Andrew Higgs, the Commonwealth champion, going back to back, Patrick Connolly.
James Campbell will be 3rd.
Daniel Kelly, the world champion, fading over the last few metres, brave fight but he just couldn't produce it today.
Brendan Pine for Australia...
It's a new world record.
As we look at the scoreboard, where did the Australians finish?
Oh, Daniel Kelly - what a shame.
Not only has his world record been broken, but he's finished in 4th place.
That's extremely disappointing for him.
His trademark finish was there, but it was just too late to catch the Commonwealth champion, Andrew Higgs.
Bad luck.
Can the officials from Australia please come down and...
Hey! Hey, mate!
Come on, catch your breath.
Out you come.
Please, please! Please, please!
He's with me, with me.
Danny, Danny?
Danny, look at me.
Danny, it's time to get out, son.
Come with me. Come on.
Well, perhaps his coach can get him out of the water.
He's certainly shattered by that result.
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!
Come on, Danny.
..who broke a world record not so long ago.
You'd have to start to question whether or not he'll come back emotionally for the Olympic Games after that result.
Come on.
Come on.
(WEEPS)
Come on. It's OK.
Come here, my boy. Come here.
Hey, Danny! Danny.
Danny, Danny. Come here, come here.
Come here, come here.
He's OK!
Come here. Ssh.
Wow. I haven't seen anything like this before.
He's beside himself, Daniel Kelly.
It's OK. Listen to me.
Listen to me. Come here. Ssh, ssh.
Come on. Hey! Hey, hey.
Ssh. You have nothing to be ashamed of.
Danny! How ARE you?
So you didn't make the Olympics.
Get over it.
You wanted it as much as I did!
I never wanted it like you.
He hasn't been in the pool or to the beach for the past two years.
He said he wasn't going to do anything.
Another wayward soul looking to find meaning in hard work.
I'm not here to swim.
I'm not coming back.
Don't waste what you have.
It would be a loss.
You're not allowed to be here.
I need to talk to Martin.
The greatest joy I ever had in my life is to watch you swim.
