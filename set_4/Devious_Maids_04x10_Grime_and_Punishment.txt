We can tear those up.
So, where does that leave us?
Are we married or not?
That's wonderful, Rosie.
[Chuckles] Give Spence my love.
Okay, bye.
[Keypad beeps]
Peter.
What are you doing here?
Well, I saw you on the news when Gail Fleming was arrested.
Oh.
Figured it was the universe giving me a kick in the pants.
What?
I've been acting like a big baby.
But I was hurt.
See, when I was in New York, I bought a ring.
Oh, my God.
I realized that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
And then I came back and found out that you didn't feel the same way.
But I did. I do.
It just didn't seem that you felt the same way.
[Sighs]
Peter, I made the biggest mistake.
Well, I don't want to make a bigger one by letting you go.
So...
What is happening?
Well, it's an engagement party.
 should be getting engaged.
Marisol Suarez, will you marry me?
[Laughs]
Yes.
Oh, Peter.
Oh!
[Chuckles]
You got fired? It was for the best.
But having a boss like Fiona made me see that you're not so bad after all.
That's what I always told you.
So, I was thinking maybe...
You want your job back?
Oh, I'm so, so happy!
Wait.
Your key.
Here.
And you better never give it back to me.
Deal.
But I do think we need to set some ground rules first.
No meddling in each other's lives.
You're right.
From now on, you do you, and I'll do me.
Look at you with the lingo.
[Both chuckle]
[Doorbell rings]
Oh, I'll get it. I have a date.
And I'm not gonna ask who he is because I'm not meddling.
[Gasps] Cute dress.
Ooh, I'm totally gonna borrow that.
Zoila, this is Lori... my date.
Your date?
Lori.
I've always been unlucky in love, so maybe, after five husbands, what I need is a wife.
Have fun.
Daddy! We missed you!
[Laughing] Ohh!
Easy,
 Your daddy's still healing.
Oh, no, that's okay.
I really missed you guys, too, but I promise I am back now for good.
[Laughter]
We're glad to have you back, boss.
[Spence groans]
Jesse, can you grab the boys some lunch?
I need to talk to Spence.
'Course. Come on, guys. I'll make some nuggets.
What do you need to talk to me about?
It's not Shannon, is it?
She doesn't want to stay here, does she?
No, no, no, it's not that. [Groans]
She already packed up and went home.
Well, why are you so serious?
Is it one of the boys? Miguel? Tucker?
I've been waiting to tell you till you got home.
Well, just tell me. I can handle it.
I know you think of Tucker as your baby boy, but...
What?
Tucker's gonna be a big brother.
Miguel, too.
[Gasps] You're pregnant?
[Both laugh]
I guess we weren't too careful on those conjugal visits.
Are you happy?
Oh, I've never been happier in my whole life.
I love you, Rosie.
I love you, too.
Mr. Spence.
[Both laugh]
Ay, Peter looks so handsome.
And he is crazy about Marisol.
Mmhmm.
They're so good together.
Hey, it took me 40 minutes to get my makeup to look like this.
Nobody make me cry.
It took you 40 minutes to do
I'm gonna make 
 cry. [Scoffs]
[Cellphone vibrating]
[Wagner's "Bridal Chorus" plays]
Rosie.
Oh! Sorry.
Spence and the baby say hi.
Ay, enough with the baby. We're here to party.
Open bar!
[Music continues]
Where is she?
I'm sorry. We need a moment.
[Guests murmuring]
What's going on?
I don't know.
She was supposed to be right behind me.
[Rosie chuckles nervously]
Marisol?
What the hell?
Where'd she go?
"I'm sorry"?
Marisol got cold feet?
I thought she was happy with Peter.
