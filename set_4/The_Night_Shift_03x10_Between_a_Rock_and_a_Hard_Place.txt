It's good to see you.
You too, Bennet.
Meet Paul Cummings.
Hey.
Victim's over here.
Out of the way! Hey, coming through!
What do we got?
Jalen Dawson, 17. Wind knocked the crane over, hit him on his head, rolled over onto his leg.
: No luck reaching his mom on her cell.
State Patrol's heading to their house now.
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
Stop bagging.
T.C., no corneal reflex.
Is that bad?
This is Clayton Timmons.

He owns the quarry.
This is Dr. Callahan and Dr. Cummings.
The blow to his head looks like it was too severe.
I'm sorry, but he's brain-dead.
He's not gonna make it.
: That's it?
You have to do something.

He's just a kid.
I-I-I understand that this is hard to hear, all right?
But he suffered total and irreversible loss of brain function.
: All we could do right now is make him as comfortable as possible before he passes, okay?
I'm sorry, again.
It's gonna be an hour, maybe less.
He was leaving for Duke in two weeks. Damn shame.
T.C., he's young and healthy, major organs intact.
He could be a donor.
Right, maybe... maybe Brianna.
Yeah.
And if not her, then somebody else.
Okay, Brianna. There you go.
Now you don't have to be stuck in that bed all day.
Thanks. Does it go back all the way?
Of course it does.
Up, down... I don't know. Press the buttons.

There you go.
Look at that.
It's not quite like a roller coaster, but it will do for now.
I got more good news for you.
You got bumped up on the lung transplant list, so you are in the top five.
That just means my lungs are getting worse.
I'm gonna have to go on a ventilator soon, right?
We'll figure it out, okay?
Listen, you've had eight potential donors in the past three weeks.
That's promising.
And none of them matched.
And the reason they didn't match was because you...
Because I have to match not only the blood type, but six surface antigens.
It has to be perfect or they'll go to someone else who is perfect... which is never me.

Healthy, young college kid.

Really? So you're bringing him in here?
Well, not yet.
He's pinned under a crane at a quarry.
But we're gonna send the blood over to you with a trooper.
Drew, don't get your hopes up.
It's a long shot.
They aren't.
Thanks.
So, it wasn't a rumor.
The hospital is really getting sold to Hobart Insurance?
Not necessarily. They made a low-ball offer.
Hobart's ruthless.
They bought my cousin Cherion's hospital in Tulsa.
They gutted the staff and turned the ER into a plastic surgery center.
[Groans] We're screwed.
Not if we can get the county to take us over.
We have a great argument... only ER for this community.

Yes, I did.
Mr. Martin, this accident has torn apart your lives.
But when are you going to start putting them back together again?
Now, Malik... he wants to, but you
 to.
You got a second chance.
Don't waste it.

[Sighs]
Excuse me.
Dad, please.
So... tell me about some of these treatments.
Okay.
There are a couple of therapies that we should discuss...
T.C.
Huh? Oh.
They said you got burned. Oh, my God.
Hey. Whoa. Hey.
I got exposed to something in the field...
Still waiting on the labs.
[Scoffs]
Uh...
By the way, thank you for helping Toph out with the books tonight.
That was cool.
It's no big deal, really.
No, it is, to me.
It's his crusade, and, uh, it means a lot, so...
Well. [Chuckles] You okay?
Hey, T.C.
Yeah.
Ah, Evel Knievel is back out of CT. I got him.
I, uh, heard you fractured a few ribs.
Yeah. So, did my dad get here?
Yeah, about that...

I spoke to the sheriff.
They checked his work, but he never showed up today.
[Scoffs]
Yeah. I'm sorry.
So, are you feeling better?
Uh, much better now.
[Chuckles]
All right.
Robbie, this is Jessica...
Hi.
My girlfriend.
"Your girlfriend"? That's a first.
Yeah. You know, got to keep you guessing.
[Chuckles]
Right. We better go.

I'll catch you later?
Yeah.
Okay.
Bye, Robbie.
Bye.
Hey, Jessica. Here's that card.
If this ship's going down, I'm going down with it.
That's a mistake. You need to have a plan.
I-I have a plan.
What do you think about this?
It's an election year.
We pressure the county supervisors to buy the hospital.
[Sighs] That's not gonna happen.
We make it about local jobs.
That's not gonna happen because Hobart already won the bid.
No. Wh... where'd you hear that?
Hobart.
Why wou...
They hired me to run their transition team.
Hired you?
You're a pharm rep.
With an MBA.
Wait a second. You've seen all our books.
I trusted you!
[Sighs]
You've been playing us all this time?
Look, Topher...
Spare me.
I get it.
I get that you're pissed, okay?
But there's one more thing that you need to know.
What, that you're the devil?
You're the first one that's gonna be fired.
Hobart wants their own ER chief.
You don't have to be a martyr.
Just take the damn card.
Jesus. [Scoffs]
♪♪
Those cops here for me?
: Yep.
Timmons filed a complaint.
Look. I know you think you got no other option right now.
That the story of your life's already written?
It's not.
There's good people out there, people you haven't even met yet who are gonna change your life for the better, trust me.
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
Ugh, and the other kid...
Jalen.
The brainiac?
He's in my brother Garret's class.
Not anymore 'cause he's dead.
But you're still here, so what are you gonna do with that chance?
Don't screw it up, all right?

No. No, I did not lie to you, T.C.
You lied to me every time you didn't tell me.
You're working for people who want to destroy everything I care about, who see sick people as profit centers.
