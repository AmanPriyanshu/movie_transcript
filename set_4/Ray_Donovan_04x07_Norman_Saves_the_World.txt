 Ray Donovan...
You want this money? f*ck you!
Throw the f*cking can!

That money... was it to get Belikov out?

: 
I'll take the rap for the murders.
: 
Really? You think so?
Yeah, I do.
Funny. He was fine with me... before Romero, before you.
I got a job for you.
You got anything on Jackson Holt?
There you go.
Sherman f*cking Radley?
The file I have on this guy will shock the f*cking world, all right?
You bring it to Holt, that guy will do whatever the f*ck it is you need him to do.
Belikov's out. We're done.
We're done, but you know Russian men.
Just go see him. Apologize for any problems that you might have caused.
: You've been useful for Sonia.
Now be useful to me.

Ship her back to my people in Moscow.
They will dispose.

Twelve hundred a day for ten days, 250 for snacks, the Thai food the other night, and 599 for the hard drive itself.
You're gonna charge me for the Thai food that you ate most of, huh?

Well, I...
I got a proposition for you.
Hector would like to train here.
Yeah, well, we like the vibe.
Uh, Hector's comfortable here.
He likes how real it is.
He wants to change things up.
Thinks of you all as family.
Right, Hector?
[cell phone chimes, bloops]
I do.
Hey, hey. What's good?
Hector wants to train here.
He's got a rematch with Whittaker.
Oh, that's what's up.
Uh, we're gonna cover all your costs.
Uh, basically, that means we're gonna four-wall the place... control the club, the hours, who comes in, who doesn't, et cetera.
That's not a problem.
Yeah, I'd also like to do some interviews, let the press see the new club.
Press?
Press is good.
Mm.
We want to do those this afternoon.
Couple of amateur fights going off in half an hour, but after that, it's all yours.
Yeah, I mean, guys, everything sounds great.

Uh, champ, I just want to let you know that, uh, I'm here for you, whatever you want.
Oh, yeah?

Who is it you want to get out of prison?
My father.
Your father?
Same guy you brought Sully 3,000 miles to murder?
Same guy.
All right, great. Um...
What's he in for?
The Minassian shooting.
That shitshow out in Glendale?
You're telling me that geriatric f*ck took out eight armed gangsters by himself?
You gonna help me or not, Cochran?
Uh, okay.
Where do they have him... Men's Central?
Yeah. I want to get him into protective custody.
They got a special wing for gay people.
You want to pass off your dad as a homo, huh?
No, no, that's... I love that plan.
Okay. Um, guy named Burt Mancini runs that joint.
He is a genuine pain in the balls.
You're gonna need some interview questions, which I think I can get for you, but... it's gonna cost you an extra hundred thousand dollars.
I just gave you a million dollars.
Yeah, but you just ordered off the menu.
That's... that's extra.
That's not just my policy. That's standard. Ask anybody.
It's all right if you don't have it on you.
I know you're good for it.
Hey, Ray?
You think there's a reason that we're working together?
No.
I do.
I think we're the instruments for each other's enlightenment, man.
[chuckles]
[plucks guitar string]
: In here.
Fifteen minutes, Donovan.
How you doing?
I'm all right. You?
I'm all right.
That fancy lawyer of yours is telling me he can get it down to 120 years.
He's really good. [laughs]
Ah, all things considered, I'm hanging in.
I need you to memorize some questions.
You're gonna get interviewed to get moved.
Moved? Why?
Russians aren't gonna protect you anymore.
What happened?
What'd you do, Ray?
We're gonna move you into protective custody, K6G, the gay wing.
Gay wing?
You're not safe, Mick.
You want to live, you'll memorize these questions, and you'll tell the guards you're gay.
What?
You're gay.
That's really kind of loving, you trying to keep me safe.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Just want you to know I see it. That's all.
It's sweet.
Will you look at the f*cking questions, Mick?
I don't need a crib sheet.
Just ask me. Ask me a question.
Will you stop?
Hey, I did 20 years in Walpole.
Got the gay thing down.
Just memorize the questions.
Make you happy.
Yeah, sure. I know... I know all this sh1t.
Yeah?
I got it.

Hi. Uh, I'm Daryll.

No. Potatoes.
Yeah.
Yeah. I'll be back in a second.
[man speaking indistinctly over PA system]
Hey. Uh...
I want to... I want to put in for a transfer to the gay wing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Hey, come on.
I'm not kidding here.
All right, inmate, back to work.
Cut the crap. I said back to work.
I'm serious. I had enough of this f*cking harassment.
You know how much sh1t I've taken in my life?
What I've been cheated of?
All I had to survive?
I'm a gay man. I'm a gay man. I know my rights.
I-I don't feel safe here.
You... you talk to whoever you got to talk to and tell them that you got a guy who's on the f*cking ledge here, on the f*cking ledge.
[cell phone rings]
Yeah, what's up, Ray?
You're gonna get a call from a deputy who works at Men's Central.
Why?
: 
What?
: 
But he ain't gay.
: 
How do you know?
: 
I don't get it.
: 
They're gonna put him in a protective wing.
Make sure you tell Bunchy, too.
Was that Ray?
Yeah.
Now, we get a call from the jail, we got to say Mick's gay.
I actually think he might've done some stuff back in Walpole.
Might've blown a guy or something.
I don't want to hear that.
Eh, he's actually kind of proud of it.
Said it... it's like being ambidextrous.
Just tell Daryll, okay?
Wait. Is... is this it?
Be right back.
Well, you want me to get your bags, bring them...
I said I'd be right back.
Fresh from the FBI basement.
Fiona Miller. You remember her?
No.
She played Coffee Shop Girl on Norman Saves the World.
Oh, don't tell me you don't watch Sherman Radley's sitcom.
Ray, you're missing the best show on television.
He's a successful father of two, but then his mom dies, so he starts to dress up like her, you know, as you do, because he can't break it to the kids that grandma's dead.
Sounds kind of stupid when you say it out loud, but it... it's genuinely hilarious.
Yeah, you probably don't watch much TV, do you?
You have an actual life.
What about Fiona Miller?
Well, she disappeared about...
God, it was ten years ago already.
The papers said it was drug-related.
And?
It wasn't.
Radley tried to force himself on her one night at his mansion after a taping.
And she wasn't having any of it, so he lost his sh1t, and he f*cking stabbed her to death.
You got proof?
I do, actually.
Somebody at the FBI was paid by Radley's people to make key evidence disappear out of the FBI locker.
You?
Very good, Ray.
One murder weapon, complete with Sherman's DNA and his fingerprints.
No, no, no. Very handsy, Ray.
You got a body?
Nick Lowell, the agent. You know him?
Sure.
Yeah, of course you do.
You know every douche bag in town.
He's Sherman's guy.
He hired me to get rid of the knife, but he hired somebody else to get rid of the body.
Who?
Well, I don't know.
That's what you're gonna get him to tell us.
I'll broker the deal with Holt.
[sighs]
What?
I want you to know something, okay?
This version of me... This was not how I started out.
I had good intentions, okay?
Now, this... it's important to me that you know this, for some f*cking reason.
You were born a scumbag. I just...
I got worn down.

The body and the murder weapon?
Yes, Jackson, with DNA and fingerprints intact.
I just charged this guy with eight counts of homicide.
Best I could do is let him plead to felony manslaughter and release him quietly in a few months.
Best you could do is admit this Minassian thing is a dog turd of a case and say yes.
Eh, maybe, but if there's even a whiff of quid pro quo on this...
There will not be.

Mickey Donovan serves three months minimum.

Hey, Av.
: 
Yeah. I'm looking at him right now.
: Really? How's he look?
I don't know.
Older.
Ezra loves him... for the dark sh1t, stuff he wanted to protect you from.
I would've thought he'd be off riding a yacht in the Bahamas or something.
Yeah? Well, he's in Canoga Park, pushing a lawn mower.
[line beeps]
That's Lena. I'll call you back.
[line trilling]
Yeah, you're right.
Cochran's going into Sherman's trailer right now.
Good. Let him go.
But he's f*cking you over.
I know he is.
Let him.

: This it?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Radley will be with you as soon as the taping ends.
Oh, lovely.
If you want, there's water.
There should be snacks in there.
If you need anything, just let me know. I can...

Hey, Sherm. Wow.
It's quite something to take in in person.
What the hell are you doing here, Mr. Cochran?
Oh, that's impressive.
It's always very nice when big celebrities remember the names of the humble public servants that they used along the way.
Look, what is this all about?
Well, if I'm here, you kind of know what it's about, don't you, Sherm?
Nick Lowell gave you up to Ray Donovan, and he's about to find Fiona Miller's body.
Look, I don't know nothing about...
Oh, Sherm, I'm a big fan.
I could listen to you bullshit all day long, but you got about 30 minutes before your entire life face-plants, okay?
All right. Asshole.
How much is this gonna cost me?
Five million dollars.
What the f*ck?
Oh, Sherm, relax.
You pay that to have your balls loofah'd in Beverly Hills.
What do I get for that?
I make Ray Donovan disappear.
I also need to move that body from wherever it is you got her buried... you know, after you killed her.
Sherm, are you familiar with Ray Donovan?
Heard of him. Never met him.
Yeah, well, you don't want to meet him, especially if he gets to that body before I do.
So the clock is ticking.
Where's she buried, man?
The storage room of my crab restaurant in Inglewood.
The Crab Grab. I remember that place.
It's closed now.
Oh, really?
Drive-through crab legs didn't work out in Inglewood, huh?
[chuckles] Go figure.

I just left Holt.
I'm at the In-N-Out grabbing a burger.
Why? You want me to meet you?
You want to kill me, Cochran?
Is that it?
Ray, you sound a little bit paranoid.
You need to get out of there.
You don't know who you're dealing with.
