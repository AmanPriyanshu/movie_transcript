I'm going to run for president, and try to finish what you started, so our daughters won't have died for nothing.

 an election, we give it legitimacy.
At the end, they pull the rug from under our feet.
What's my alternative?
Sit out and let others decide the future of our country?
I announce my candidacy for president of Abuddin.

Do we have the go-ahead?

Full of holes.
It'd be a waste of energy. This... gets us an army.

They have begun their slaughter.
But now we will begin ours.
Rise up against the American tyrant.
The American has already lit the fire inside Abuddin.
This is the fuel.

There's no way to take this down?

We can't trace it?
They covered their tracks.
The thing's working, too.
Three attacks in the last two days on police in Ma'an.
Two close calls at the university.
Conservative, Islamist students radicalized by this sh1t.
These guys are real pros.

Kill them all.
Kill them all!
One by one.
From the Truth and Dignity Commission.
It's a summons to appear.
She's ordered me to give testimony.
"She"?
Daliyah Al-Yazbek.
Can she do that?
In the middle of your campaign?
What do we know about her... Daliyah?
I know what everyone knows.
She's from a small village.
Considered a folk hero.
She fought alongside Khalil.
She's been to the palace a lot recently.
They seem close.
(sighs)
Hey.
I was looking for you.
Sorry.
Lost track of time.
You still want to go for a drive?
I'm not sure.
Planted an olive tree for Emma.
So she can live on.
Or whatever.
How's your dad holding up?
I think he's just trying to focus on work.
Block everything else out.
And your mom?
Someone has to watch her 24/7.
That many pills...
Probably wasn't an accident.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
I'm still trying to wrap my head around being an only child.
Did Emma like gardens?
(chuckles)
Not really.
She kind of hated the outdoors.
(chuckles softly)
How long's she been asleep?
Since this morning.
I haven't been able to get her to eat today.
I'll stay until the night nurse comes on.
Yes, sir.

I admire the work of your commission.
I really do.
But it would be inappropriate for the sitting foreign secretary to appear.
You have my word.
I will not ask any questions about your current position.
I only care about your past.
I bet.
People deserve to understand what happened inside this palace.
And with your husband dead, that leaves you.
I won't be bullied into a public shaming.
Have you done things you should be ashamed of, Madam Secretary?
Is this what you think Bassam wants?
I don't answer to Bassam.
It's no secret he doesn't support me for president.
You haul me in in front of the commission just as I begin my campaign, and I'm sure he'll be pleased.
Well, you'd have to ask him that.
We don't talk politics.
Don't you think people wonder why a Bedouin woman with no education, no background was put in such an important position?
That's a strange accusation coming from the daughter of a kitchen maid.
Be careful.
Are you threatening me?
Be careful if you're in love with him.
You'll think the connection you have is real.
And who's to say?
Maybe it is.
But Bassam compartmentalizes.
The minute you become a liability, a wall will come down.
And you'll be cut off.
Like it never happened.
Like it was nothing.
If you refuse to appear in court, it will become part of your public record.
And I doubt that will help your poll numbers.
(door opens, closes)
Freeze!
Get down! Get down!
(grunting)
: 
What is it?
There's a military action at the university.
A remote detonation.
The girl had the cell phone in her pocket.
We think the target was the auditorium.
Any idea who called in the tip?
It was probably somebody who uses the same prayer room in the dorm.
We got lucky, Mr. President.
Well, take some credit. This is a win for us.
This is the third raid of the campus in two weeks.
And it's not going to stop.
These prayer spaces are a problem.
Religious extremists use them to spread their message, to radicalize other students.
You need to shut them down.
People need a place to pray.
Then let them pray at the university's Central Mosque.
At least there, you can monitor them.
Mr. President, one day, we're going to stop getting lucky.
And when that happens, and that girl with the backpack gets further than her dorm room, people are going to die.
And then you'll have to respond with force.
And that's exactly what they're waiting for.

Where are we supposed to pray?
You stood in front of your followers and you called it my "American war."
You called it a crime.
It is a crime.
You killed children.
The Caliphate put those children there.
You don't know that, and even if...
And then, you used it as an excuse to incite violence.
I won't take responsibility for a few crazy people.
Then take responsibility for stopping them.
I cannot support closing places of worship.
If all they were doing was praying, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
But that's not the reality.
They are terrorist cells.
You have no evidence of that.
You're implying anywhere people gather to pray is a breeding ground for terror.
No, I am not.
You can pray freely in the Central Mosque.

Under your watchful eye.
With him preaching.
Everyone knows that he is an Al Fayeed stooge.
What, now he will peddle your government-sanctioned religious message?
I wonder if you would be so poisonous if your Caliphate-loving brother-in-law had not paid for your mosque.
I will have no part in this.

You have strong favorables among males, 45 to 64.
The youth numbers are softer.
What's the bottom line?
You're 15 points behind Fauzi among likely voters.
I see.

Thank you, both of you.

That's never been a comfortable position for you.
It's not where I should be.

And I want to begin today by saying thank you so much for all your support.
I know you guys have been working hard, and you know what?
It's paying off.
It's just the first poll, and we have a long way to go, but we had a good day today.
(crowd cheering)
You're good. Thank you. Thank you.
We love you, man. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.
So, what'd you think of the speech?
Uh, not bad.
"Not..."
On a scale of one to ten?
I'd give it a six and a half.
Six and a half?
You're not an easy grader.
But at least you stuck around for the whole thing.
Yeah, I wanted to see if it got any better.
Well, thank you.

The polls look good.
Yeah, don't jinx it now.
You must be happy.

You know, a few of us are going to a cafe for a drink.
You should join us.
Come on, celebrate with me.
I'm politically neutral.
Requirement of the job.
I understand.
I had a dream about you, you know.
Really?
Yeah, we were rollerblading in a park in London.
And I was late for a rally, so we decided to hail a taxi.
But Angela Merkel was driving and-and... she wouldn't let us in because of the rollerblades, so we grabbed onto the side of the cab and she took off, dragging us the whole way.
Well, at least Angela Merkel wasn't naked.
Yeah.
Did we have fun?
We had a great time.
(chuckles) Good.
Staring at the poll numbers all day won't change them.
The things you said to Bassam in the palace, you need to say them to the people.
Fauzi and Leila, they're part of the administration.
They can't speak out.
You can.
But nobody's listening, Nafisa.
Nobody's listening.
There are protests planned at the university.
You should be there.
Make them into a campaign rally.
Make the president your enemy.
Bassam gave you a gift with the prayer space closures.
Take it.
: Hey. You're up.
It's good to see.
Barry.
What's going on?
There's an in-patient treatment center in Germany.
I-I'm gonna check myself in.
Okay, uh, Molly, look, look.
I want you to get help. But let's talk about this.
I need you to arrange a plane for me.
I need you to do that, okay?
Molly, I know you're in pain...
Barry, it's not safe for me.
I've come so close to...
I don't trust myself.
I need to go get better.
You can get better here. With us.
I can't.
It's too hard.
I keep looking out the window, thinking I'm, um, gonna see the person I used to be walking by.
I've been working too much, haven't been here for you.
Dad, it's not about you.
And I know that you're angry and you blame me for what happened.
I blame myself.
I'm guilty.
I'll carry that the rest of my life.
Molly, please don't do this.
It's taking everything I have to ask for help, Barry.
And maybe you'll understand, and maybe you won't, but I can't be here anymore.
I walk past her room and I see her.
I look at your faces and I see her.
I thought I wanted that.
The reminders... they made me feel close to her.
But when you're alone with them, you realize there's nothing really there.
Just... loss and more loss.
How long will you be gone?
I don't know.
You want to know what you can do for me, Barry?
You can let me go.
Could you pass the coffee?
Yeah.
Oh, I must've finished it.
That's okay.
I'll get them to make some more.
No, don't-don't worry about it.
I'm fine.
Had too much already.
Maybe we should get a dog.
What?
People have been sending us things.
Gifts, you know.
For Emma.
Someone wrote and said they wanted to give us a puppy.
You remember when Emma got bitten by that dog when she was little?
That was me.
No, it was the, um... the Kreutziger's German Shepherd.
It, uh... she was trying to pet it.
Thor.
He bit me.
It was a long time ago.
I, um...
I called the treatment center this morning.
They said your mom's getting settled in.
Dad, I really think you should give her some space.
I know.
I know.
The Abuddinian Women's Forum has been a constructive voice on women's issues for a quarter century.
In order to be your next president and put women's issues on the agenda in this country, I'm going to need your support.
In 20 years in the palace, and two years as first lady, you never showed up here once.
That's true.
Now you want us to support you for president just because you're a woman?
The forum was highly critical of my husband and his father.
It was very difficult for me to express my true feelings.
1,000 women and 400 children died in the gassing of Ma'an.
And you stood by your husband's side and said nothing.
Many of us know what it means to live under the thumbs of our husband.
All of us know people who have died for what they believed in.
You survived by staying silent.
What's that?
What does it mean?
The loss of the self.
Thought we were gonna start small.
Like "cat" or something.
Oh, I like to challenge my students.
Hmm.
You ever done this before with another student?
"This"?
Ah, you mean teach Arabic?
Mm.
No.
So I'm special.
Very.
Why?
Really?
You want me to flatter you?
No.
I want you to tell me the truth.
You're sleeping with me 'cause I'm the president's son.
If I was sleeping with you to get ahead in politics, I wouldn't be criticizing your father online.
You're criticizing him?
Don't you read my blog?
I don't like you that much.
Oh.
What are you saying?
I said he's wrong to close the prayer spaces.
Well, he thinks those people are dangerous.
Who's dangerous?
All Muslims who pray in any prayer space?
They're all dangerous?
What if the governments decide all gay men are dangerous?
(crowd chanting outside)
: Let us pray! Let us pray! Let us pray! Let us pray! Let us pray! We want to pray! Let us pray! We want to pray! We want to pray!
I'm on my way to the university.
I only have a minute, but... how are you?
How's my nephew?
Is he still smarter than both of us?
: Of course.
They've closed the schools, so I've been tutoring the kids at home.
They closed the schools? Why?
The Caliphate claim they want to govern, but they can't manage it.
The phones, schools, hospitals, everything's shut down.
I didn't know it was that bad.
And we just got a warning about more bombings.
Some people are talking about leaving, crossing the border into Abuddin.
I heard they set up a refugee camp.
You should come with them, Latif.
It's hard.
This is Randa's home, her country.
And I've heard things are difficult on your side of the border, too.
I don't want to trade one Syria for another.
We can make a better life for you here, brother.
I still believe in this place.

Apparently, that's a crime I can never be pardoned for.

To some people, I will always be the American, the Western infidel.
Doesn't matter what the truth is.

Before Jamal became... Jamal.
Before you went to America.
When we were just... us.
Of course.

You were always laughing.
You were curious.
You used to wake me up in the middle of the night, and we'd sneak down to the pool.
You remember?
You always wanted to see who could hold their breath longer underwater.

I underestimated her.

And, uh, and I just wanted to, um...
I'm not sure wh... what I wanted.
Um...
I don't know why, but I was just thinking about, um... thinking about that time we went to that bed-and-breakfast before we got married.
We thought it would be romantic, and when we got there, it was just us and the weird old couple that owned the place, and...
The bed was so rickety and loud that we just...
...we just laid there all night, whispering and... waiting till we could leave.
Anyway, I... I don't know why I just thought of that, but, um...
I'm thinking of you and, uh... and I hope they're taking good care of you.
Bye.
The secular government of Abuddin expects us to yield, to stand by while they prevent us from worshipping together, to stand by while they police our relationship with God.
But we will not stand by.

We cannot stand by!
Their concern is violence, hatred.
But if we allow their oppression to continue... that's exactly what they risk.
Violence and hatred.

This is exactly what I mean.
You people... you're crazy.
: The world, this government, is afraid of us.
Today, we have an opportunity to show Abuddin... To show the world...
They are wrong to fear us.
Our holy book teaches us that a true Muslim is the one that follows the straight path.
The path of peace.
Of mercy.
Of restraint.
Even when we are tested, we must not stray from that path.
I ask you all to pray with me now.

I'm going.
What? Why?
He wants us to pray with him?
We need to do more than pray if we want things to change.

No one is listening, Hanif.

 on standby outside the university, waiting for me to give them the go-ahead to move to the perimeter of the protest.
I don't like it.
Troops facing off against students.
History is not on our side here. Tahrir Square, Tiananmen Square...
Don't tie my hands, Mr. President.
I need my troops there before things get out of hand, not after.
Ahmed, this is not a good time.

And now people find out his son is having a homosexual affair with a married man.
So are you saying I can never have a personal life in this place?
Don't do this.
Everything we care about is too important.

And you'll run a good race.
You'll lose, but you'll lose well.
You'll spend the next four years as the leader of the opposition.
Not inside the palace, on the streets.
And when the next election comes, it'll be the new you who runs and wins.
So that's it? Wait until next time?
Success is about readiness matched with opportunity.

Come to dinner tonight. We can talk it through.
I can't. I have a meeting.

At night?
Dressed like that?
I don't need your advice on my wardrobe.
Don't tell me that you and he are...
Or my personal life.
Do you know how dangerous this is?
You were leaving.
Don't let me stop you.
I always thought of you as many complicated things.
Naive was not one of them.
You really think that, four months from now, when Fauzi is president and you are nothing, not even foreign secretary, that he will still be interested in you?
(door opens, closes)
You're a popular man these days; I thought you'd appreciate the privacy.
Isn't it a bit early to be making overtures?
Not according to the polls.
A lot can happen in four months.
Sure.
The sky could fall, but probably not.
I've spent the last couple of months developing a relationship with the Al Fayeeds.
But the truth is, you're the man I needed to be talking to.
I'm listening.

: Go home, dogs!
: Let us pray!
(crowd murmuring)
: Move in.
You think you scare me?
You collaborating piece of sh1t!
Take another step.
Take one more step!
Stand down.
We have every right to be here!
(crowd clamoring)
I said stand down.
You want to shoot me?
Shoot me! Do it! Shoot me!
Stop this! I'm saying stop this now!
Stop this now!
They're trying to make us into martyrs!
We are all willing!
Is that what you think God wants?
More martyrs?
Paradise is full of martyrs.
The real sacrifice is to live here, with us, and try to make peace.
This man is your brother.
Thank you for showing restraint.
Thank you for showing restraint.
Thank you, thank you.
We have made our voices heard here.
We will leave this square peacefully, with the promise to come back tomorrow, and every day after that, until the prayers are allowed to continue on our own terms.
Please leave in peace.
Leave in peace, please.
Please, leave in peace.
Where is he?
Gone to the mosque to pray.
He had their attention.
All those people.
All he had to do...
I know.

He's becoming a problem, Nafisa.
Should I be afraid?
No.
If it comes to it... if something were to happen to him...

He's the father of my children.
We survived without both parents.
That's not what I want for them.

Thank you.
The first wave of refugees is trickling in.
Everything's going smoothly.
Inshallah.
Well, let's take good care of them.
It's the most effective weapon we have against the Caliphate if people see we're compassionate.

Please know that you're safe here.
We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable and process you as quickly as possible.
