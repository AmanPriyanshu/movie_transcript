Previously on 19-2...
Want me to find your body in the morgue?
Better you than your mother.
OK, yeah.
You're a piece of work, aren't you?
145.
Oh, he's so cute.
What the hell d'you do to me?
Jesus Christ, do you know whose kid that is?
What are you, drunk?
No. What's your problem?
She's drunk?
(screaming)
Tyler!
Tyler!
(heavy breathing)
You left me there and he was kicking me.
Did you leave your partner?
I'm afraid of the dark, Bear.
I know.
I'm a man of my word.
So who is he?
Read it.
Alfonso Batista, 16 arrests, 4 convictions.
He's a pimp.
What about Martine?
Nothing to do with her.
You sure?
She's in a hotel. Three full-time guards, Her name won't appear anywhere.
Until she testifies.
I love you, Ben Chartier.
My mother told me never to go into the wilderness with strangers.
Well, good thing this is not the wilderness. Better?
Not really.
Hold it just like that, barrel up.
OK.
It's heavy, huh?
Yeah.
Look at this. Just take out the back... see how much more sturdy that is?
Ahh! (laughing)
You know how to hold this, right?
You keep yours down, that way I keep my barrel up in this way.
So... this is it.
What is this place?
You showed me your secret spot, I thought I'd show you mine.
This... this... is my great-great-grandpa. I think. Could be my great-great-great.
You know I told you my dad used to take me shooting every Sunday?
Here?
Hunting camp's about a mile that way.
Yeah, we'd shoot, then he'd drink and eventually pass out, and then I would drive him home for supper.
How old were you?
Started when I was eight.
Anyway, I'd go exploring, and I found this place.
It's nice, huh?
Yeah. Did you ever bring him here?
No. No, I've never brought anybody here.
OK...
So, he'd teach me how to shoot, for the first hour or so, then I'd come here and practice.
And I got pretty good.
Is that how you kept yourself together?
It's how I kept myself from shooting him, if that's what you're asking.
There's something about target practice that clears your head. If you wanna make that shot, you gotta let go of everything.
Just wash everything else out until that can's the only thing you see, OK?
OK.
Now do as I do here.
You wanna keep it nice and solid against your shoulder before you turn the safety off.
This is gonna buckle a little bit, right?
It's gonna buck.
(laughing)
Take my position.
Safety is off.
You're cocked, locked and ready to rock.
Got the can in your scope?
Yeah.
OK. Take in a deep breath... let it out. Don't shoot until there's no air left in your lungs.
OK.
And press the trigger, don't pull it.
What? That doesn't make any sense.
Don't... don't think about it, just do it. Send it.
(laughing and whooping)
Look at this one, shooting fancy!
Not a bad fluke.
No, no, it's no fluke.
It was brilliant.
Thank you.
You're a tough act to follow.
Was your dad as good a shot as you are?
Yeah, it was the one thing that he was really good at.
[Copy, 19-2.]
[32 - 5?]
So, how's things with lover boy?
OK.
Is this the part where we talk about our feelings?
Yeah, and then we do each other's nails.
Did you see him last night?
Mm-hmm. Went to one of his shows.
And?
Fifteen people, and he thinks he's a rock star, but... something about a guy on a stage, though, I'm telling you.
Far cry from dating a cop.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, it's more like dating a stripper.
Oh! Ha ha!
(laughing)
So my dad's out of detox. He's gonna stay with Amélie and I for a little while.
Sounds romantic.
Uh-huh.
Am's good with it?
Says she is.
It was her idea, actually.
Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh"?
My sister gets a lot of ideas.
She bottles 'em up when things don't work out.
Not really worried about that. We, uh, we talk about these things.
It's good. Good communication there.
Well, as long as she doesn't go for the pork rinds, you'll be alright.
Pork rinds?
Pork rinds... I don't even know what that it.
Is it like... it's like a food?
It's food.
So she goes for the pork rinds, I'm in trouble?
When she's stressed. She was always a weird kid.
I don't even know what they are.
[All units: we have a report of a prowler, alley behind]
[4481 d'Iberville.]
19-2 responding.
(siren)
[19-49 to base, we're available and close.]
Look at that, right there.
There?
Yeah.
No.
Georgie.
You know him?
Georgie, time to wake up, come on.
Come on, man.
You know you can't stay here. This is somebody's place. Somebody's home.
You try that balcony up here before you came down?
Yeah, the lights came on.
Yeah, that's 'cause they thought you were a prowler.
You can't be just sleeping in people's yards, man. You oughta know that.
Yeah, it's cold out.
We'll get you to a shelter, come on.
I'm not going to a shelter.
Why not?
There's perverts in there.
Think you'll be alright. Come on. We'll help ya. Let's go.
I said I'm not going.
Ben, Ben.
There's no point arguing.
He can't stay here.
Yeah. Look, get your stuff and we'll take you to Viger Square, alright?
(Tyler chuckling)
I knew that was coming. You should drink up, rook.
Double the shift, double the caffeine.
That's how we do it, baby boy.
You know I don't take it black.
Well, you'll learn to love it. It has more kick.
So first you're gonna stick a thing up my ass, and now you're gonna tell me how to drink coffee?
Hey, man, it wasn't me. And I'm pretty sure it was a butt plug, dude.
f*ck you.
f*ck me, huh?
Man, oh man, you should be thanking me.
You're already a legacy. If you hadn't gotten properly hazed, they'd have been coming after you forever. I mean, think about it.
JM's complete lack of boundaries turned out to be a blessing in disguise, my man.
[19-4, we have a fire on Ottawa.]
19-4, copy. What's the address?
[5225 Ottawa.]
(siren)
Hey, I need you around back. Switch to channel 4.
You see anything, I need to know.
Sir? Sir, I need you to get away from there.
My dog's in the house!
OK, we can send someone in for the...
Hey, we can send someone in for the dog!
sh1t! Sir!
sh1t. 19-4, an officer has entered the building in pursuit of a guy.
They're running up to the second floor.
(coughing) Frankie!
(coughing)
Sir!
Sir! (coughing)
Ah, sh1t. sh1t.
(dog yelping)
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What the... OK. Hey, hey, hey.
Tyler, I got the dog. Come back out.
19-4, back of the house. I need medical attention now.
(coughing)
Frankie!
You're crazy.
A little bit. I assume that's Frankie.
Is this your girl's room?
It's our room, yeah.
It looks like a girl's room to me.
Well, it is.
Your mother thinks I should come home.
Since when have you listened to her?
Um, doctor says it's the best place for you, so...
Doctors.
What do they know?
Actual change has to be made, but... it's good.
Right. Right. Right.
Um, I'm just gonna go...
I'm gonna go check on your dad.
Mm-hmm.
How is he?
Grumpy.
You gonna be OK with this?
I'm more worried about you.
Well, at least your mother's not staying here.
Yeah. She's right around the corner.
What are you looking for?
I had half a tin of shortbread in here.
No, you don't.
Yeah, I bought it last week.
No, you don't.
I'll go to the store. What do you want me to get?
You know what I really want? Pork rinds. Lime ones.
You can get them at the South American grocery.
Lime pork rinds.
Just indulge me.
Yeah, alright.
(ducks quacking)
Recognize him?
Batista.
sh1t.
Ciarelli did this.
Man, this is a trusted guy he killed.
Done time, never said a word.
Boss is scared if he's killing his own people.
Yeah, 'cause he knows you have a witness against him.
Gotta figure, yeah. I've already moved Martine.
Can you protect her? Tell me the truth.
This is what I do.
Where's the security?
They're watching us.
I'm breaking the rules by doing this.
I appreciate it.
How can you care about this kid so much?
I'm the reason she's stuck in this shithole.
The least I can do is show my face.
Nick!
You brought your girlfriend.
It's freezing in here.
What do you care?
Can I talk to him alone, please?
You mind?
Knock yourself out.
How you doin', you OK?
Yeah, I'm doing great. We had a deal!
We 
 a deal.
Does this look like my uncle's place?
Look, you gotta be patient, Martine, alright? These things... they take time.
They took my phone!
My uncle's gonna think I just bailed on him.
Can you go see him, or call him, whatever?
I'll make sure they take care of it.
She doesn't care, she won't do anything! Can't you do it?
I'll talk to the Inspector.
Martine...
Screw you.
Listen to me.
You're doing a really important thing here.
I know.
Be patient.
(door opening)
She's in prison.
I know, I feel for her.
What am I supposed to do, Nick?
(sighing)
She worries about her uncle. She wants me to reach out to him.
No.
Elise...
No, you can't.
I'm keeping her off the books. She's safe here. Don't f*ck with that.
You can't, for her sake.
You gotta make it right, when this is done.
I will.
I don't have a choice.
(music playing)
Promise you won't be mad when you lose?
Alright, alright, that's enough.
Here. Here you go. Here you go.
Now, before I take y'all to school, may the pool gods be with you.
I like the confidence.
Cheers.
Alright.
Cheers, boys.
Your mom's OK with your dad?
Yeah, she's good as long as she's got something to do.
Alright, who's up first?
Well, I believe you and me got some things to settle.
Oh yeah, you really wanna go back there?
This I gotta see.
You break.
Nuh-uh. We'll play teams.
Oh, teams? You afraid of taking me on?
Not at all, big bro.
I'll take you both.
See, that's my man.
Ooh... crazy man.
You're up.
After you. Ladies first.
Thank you.
Alright.
Oh, my goodness.
Ah...
We'll be here all night.
Very nice!
Yes. That's how we do!
Very nice.
Very nice.
Hey.
Hey.
You here to see Ben?
I sure am.
Heard his dad's in town, so I brought bagels.
Mmm...
Hello there.
Who's this?
This is Tyler Joseph.
Tyler...
Nice to meet you.
I work with your son. He's told me all about you.
What are you doing here?
I need an invitation to come here now, bro?
It's not a good time.
Babe, he brought lox.
And capers.
Fine.
My man.
Alright, let's get this thing started.
Matter of fact, you know what?
I bet you two lovebirds are probably dying for some time alone.
Why don't you run up to the roof and make out while me and your dad get this breakfast thing ready?
What's down here?
Babe, let's go.
Have fun.
How bad is it?
What?
When you planning on taking the next drink?
Who do you think you are?
I'm you. At least I used to be.
You don't know anything about me.
I know you're probably dying for a drink right now.
And I bet you're terrified, same as I was.
Thing is, anyone who told you it was gonna be easy is lying to you.
I've been in AA almost two years.
And yeah, I fell off the wagon a couple times, but I'm good now.
I hate to be the one to break up this love fest, but I'm gonna have to be that guy 'cause I needs me a ride to work.
Alright, good buddy.
Mm-hmm. My man.
I'll see you later.
Bye.
And the cream cheese. Tell me that you've done this before.
I sure... I sure have.
I appreciate it, man.
Hey, no problem.
Joseph. Nice job.
Thank you, sir.
What's that about?
Just another day at the office.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So I was talking to your dad, and uh... I think he's ready, man. I think he wants to be dry.
You think so?
I do.
Really?
Yeah.
Guess we'll soon find out.
Ohh!
Look who it is!
The incredible and fearless Tyler Joseph!
Tell me, what did I miss?
Tyler rescued a guy from a burning building last night.
What?!
It wasn't burning that much.
Yeah, it was. Guy's a complete lunatic.
Why didn't you say anything about this at breakfast?
'Cause it's no big deal!
Say something next time.
Ticking time bomb, my man, I'm telling you. Gotta watch out for him, kid.
Yeah, no sh1t.
Hey.
Hey.
You really do what they're saying you did?
I sure did.
How was it in there?
It was blacker than me in there, girl.
(scoffing)
You don't believe me?
No, I do. I believe you.
(knocking)
Charles Figo?
I'm gonna need you to come with us.
What am I being charged with?
We can discuss that downtown.
Cuff him.
In front of my family? Please.
(woman): Charlie?
Charles!
[19-2, I have an officer not responding.]
[You're my nearest unit.]
(siren)
19-2 responding.
[Sainte-Catherine and Panet.]
[She called in an arrest right before she dropped out.]
[White male, 5'11, fifties.]
The hell is she?
Lady, stay back, please. Give us the space. Get back, please.
19-2, we're on scene. No sign of the officer, but we got a body that matches the description of the suspect.
No vitals.
Suspect showing no vitals. We need medical.
Can you believe this sh1t?
[Copy, 19-2.]
He's gone.
Come on, anyone know where the officer went?
Come on, people, talk to me.
Somebody saw something.
She left. She just walked off.
Where?
She went in there.
Help me out.
What did she do to him?
Just leave it to us, ma'am.
You're leaving him now, too?
On the sidewalk, please.
Both of you on the sidewalk.
Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
(laughing) What are you doing here?
I'll get the breathalyzer.
She won't pass.
How many has she had?
Six.
Give us some space, please. Keep anybody over there.
We got a dead guy in cuffs out there.
What the hell happened?
He died.
I needed a drink.
What do you think happened, asshole?
Shh. Keep your voice down.
How'd he die? Shh.
I look like a doctor?
Answer the question.
I don't know.
I put cuffs on him and he collapsed.
He collapsed. Well, did he look like he was in distress?
Doesn't everyone?
Let's go, fellas. I'm gonna need a lift.
Keep your mouth shut out here. You're embarrassing.
Don't say a word.
This is ridiculous.
The f*ck are you looking at?
Murderer!
Hey, how come she's not in handcuffs?
'Cause I'm not under arrest, bitch!
Shut up. Keep your mouth shut.
OK. OK.
Get in the car.
Get in the car.
I'll get in.
How long do you think you can hold me?
Sorry about that. You're free to go.
What do you mean, I'm free to go?
You're not gonna charge me with anything?
What would we be charging you with?
A guy named Alfonso Batista got killed.
Got a couple of calls for you at the desk.
Lucas Ciarelli's attorney.
He's looking for you.
Of course, if you wanna talk to me... voluntarily...
Hey, I'll catch up.
Sure.
You OK?
Yeah. Why?
Are you sure?
Yeah, it's just...
Justine wants to see me.
Oh.
OK... is that... I mean...
Are you allowed?
I think. I mean... her therapist is the one setting it up, so...
Well, let me know how it goes.
How's your dad?
He's dry.
Well, that's something.
I keep thinking I'm gonna see a different guy there.
He's the same guy, he's just sober.
Yeah.
Look at this guy.
Yeah, he looks a little shifty.
Did you see that?
Does it look like he's packing?
Yeah. Left front pocket.
Look like... look like gun?
Let's go check it out.
19-2, we need backup for a possible armed robbery at the pharmacy on the corner of Sainte-Catherine and Dorion.
[That's a copy.]
Cough drops? Cough drops?
Aisle three.
Aisle three.
Thank you.
Hey. Hey. Shh. Let's go.
Get out of the store. Go.
19-2, the suspect is behind the counter of the pharmacy.
Take these ones too.
Anything you want. I'll give you more.
I'll... I'll give you anything you want, but you have to be very careful.
Police. Stay calm. Stay calm.
19-2, suspect is taking a hostage.
Stay calm. We'll get help.
Don't do it!
Look at me.
Don't do it!
Stay calm. Stay calm.
[19-2, backup is on the way.]
Stay calm, sir. Look at me.
Put down the gun. I need you to put down the gun, sir. Stay calm, put down the gun.
I need you to drop the gun.
Let her go.
Let her go, asshole. You wanna die, huh?
Drop the gun.
Drop it. Drop the gun.
Get down! Sit down!
Down on the ground!
Get on the ground!
Down! Don't move!
Don't you move!
Do you remember the first time you hit me?
Do you?
We were in Cape Breton.
Most beautiful place I've ever been.
What I remember most is I loved you just as much after you hit me as I did before.
More, even.
What are we... what are we doing here?
Do we really need your shrink here?
I need you to listen to me.
Can you do that?
Yes, I can listen to you.
Good.
It's about time you acknowledge what you've done.
Second time you hit me was Christmas Eve.
Back then, you had some control.
You remember that one?
We were all wearing... matching sweaters.
They were red. With snowflakes.
We all pretended we liked them.
Your parents with their themed Christmas presents.
You had a reason, of course.
You always had a reason.
I don't remember what it was.
It was what you were wearing to church.
That's right.
It was my top, wasn't it?
You didn't like my top.
Or you did.
Maybe that was the problem.
Nice work out there.
Thank you, Sarge.
Thank you.
I just got off the phone with Internal.
You won't have to testify about Chloe Lellouch.
Why not? It's no problem.
They come up with a ruling already?
Official report is the guy had a heart attack. There'll be no charges.
She left the scene.
Yeah. Doesn't mean she killed the guy.
So... so what, they just let her back on patrol?
She's driving around drunk off her head.
Second time we've seen it, Sarge.
They know.
They'll keep her on admin.
She doesn't clean up, she's off the job.
So...
Wow.
OK.
(music playing)
You hear it?
Yeah, I hear it. Yeah.
My God, I haven't listened to music like this since I was a kid.
You're chiller than I expected.
What did you expect?
I... I just thought all cops were adrenaline junkies.
Most of us are, yeah.
Well, I like your mellow side.
I have to show you something.
OK.
No, it's not OK, but... can I?
Yeah.
Just watch it.
Police brutality! Police brutality!
You get the f*ck out of here!
Get the f*ck out of here! You f*cking shut that thing off, 
f*ck that!
(dog barking)
(gunshot)
I've seen this.
f*ck me. What?
When? Was... before you met me?
OK, do you know how creepy that is?
A friend of mine showed it to me...
And then you hit on me?
And then I hit a car and met you. And liked you.
It's kind of an awkward thing to bring up.
Well, you should have.
Yes.
I should have.
It's not that bad.
I'm a psycho bitch, if you believe that.
It's obviously edited.
No, actually, it's... pretty much how it went down.
Did you... did you have to shoot the dog?
Yeah. Yeah, I had to shoot the dog.
How come?
Well... you see that... you see that car over there?
Mm-hmm.
Well, dealers keep their stash in it, and then they starve the dogs and get them addicted, and then they stick 'em back in so that no one's gonna touch their sh1t.
And, well, it was... it was going after a cop, so...
See? You are the good guy.
(playing guitar)
Where you going right now?
Saint-Jacques.
Can't get on from Saint-Jacques. You gotta take William.
Alright, I'll go down McGill.
McGill's closed.
You gotta go down to Wellington and come up on Duke.
Since when did you become Mr. Traffic?
Well, since the construction took over the city.
I think about it like a video game now, almost makes it kinda fun.
Yeah, I hear that. It's a joke.
Wait, is that Georgie?
Yeah.
Orange line's closed after 11. Repairs.
Right. This goddamn city.
Temperature's supposed to drop tonight, too.
He should be in a shelter.
He won't. He's afraid of 'em.
So what's the play?
You know that rooming house over on Moreau?
Yeah.
We can put him up there for a night.
What's it, 35 bucks?
Something like that.
Split down the middle?
Done.
Georgie!
Georgie! Georgie, wake up.
Georgie, we're gonna get you somewhere warmer for the night, alright?
Get your things.
(TV playing)
(cell phone buzzing)
Hello?
[Nick?]
Yeah?
I know what you did, you f*cking asshole.
[What are you talking about? Who is this?]
Martine?
Martine, where are you?
[I'm gone, Nick. I already bought my ticket.]
Don't f*cking look for me.
[OK, Martine, listen to me.]
Listen to me very carefully, alright?
[No.]
Never again. Have a sh1t life.
sh1t.
Hey.
What's wrong?
sh1t!
Hey, Sylvie, I just wanted to check on Martine Bédard.
[Good question. Listen, I'm sorta out of the loop on that.]
What do you mean?
[Apparently she's been moved again, ]
[but the paperwork hasn't come in.]
Well, did you check with the foster family?
[Yeah, weird vibe there.]
[I don't know if something happened or she bolted again]
[and they were trying to hang on to the cheque.]
Well, do you think she ran away?
[I wouldn't be surprised.]
OK, I think I know where she might be.
[OK.]
I'll let you know.
[Appreciate it.]
Francis, I have to run out and check on a client.
Are you gonna be OK for a bit?
I'm a grown man, Amélie.
Yes, I know that.
Ben is on his cell phone if you need him.
Anything?
Phone she used is right over there.
We'll get surveillance footage and... she's gotta be hitchhiking.
I can't put out an APB, Ciarelli's gonna know.
You think so?
What?
You think he'll know?
He's looking for her. He already killed Batista.
I f*cked up. A f*cking kid.
f*ck!
Hi.
Uh... you came to tell me I've been declared unfit for custody?
What?
I already heard.
When was this?
Like you don't know. What do you want?
Martine's social worker said she ran away.
Well, she's not here.
Are you sure?
You wanna come in and take a look?
Yeah, just quickly, do you mind?
Martine?
Martine?
She'll be OK, she's a tough kid.
No, she's not.
She's not.
We'll find her.
Will we?
Am, you home?
(retching)
Dad?
Dad? Dad!
Are you choking? Are you choking?
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ!
[911, what's your emergency?]
Yes, yes, Lloyd, I need an ambulance right away.
My dad drank acetone.
[OK, do you know how much?]
I... I don't know.
It's a half litre bottle, it's almost empty.
[OK, I'm gonna ask you]
Yeah.
[to monitor his breathing.]
Yeah.
[I'm gonna put you on]
[with Poison Control, alright?]
Yeah.
[Just hold on a second.]
Yeah, I'll stay on the line.
Martine?
Never did have a chance of getting custody, did I?
It was a long shot.
Why'd you string me along?
Just for kicks?
I've got another visitation to get to. Can you just call me if she shows up?
What are you looking at?
You gonna call your boyfriend, get me busted?
You haven't done enough?
I'm gonna go now.
Ah...
Tight little bitch.
You get your rocks off f*cking people around?
f*ck you!
I went to jail for that kid.
I'm all she's got and you gotta take that away from us?
She's my family.
(Amélie screams.)
Ambulance is coming. Ambulance is coming. Ambulance is coming. Ambulance is coming. Ambulance is coming.
(doorbell)
That's the ambulance.
Ben Chartier?
