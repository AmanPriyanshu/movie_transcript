Previously on Scream...
I brought Piper to Lakewood.
I can explain.
: 
Unless we stop acting like this isn't Murderville, we're all gonna end up like Jake, 
A lot of people are trying to help me right now, and it seems to be turning out for the worst.
: 
: 
Down on your knees now!
Where's Kieran?!
Emma, drop the weapon.
Oh, my God! Kieran!
: 
: 
Where's the mask?
You really think I carve people up and hang them up like pieces of meat?
If you think I'm a killer, prove it.
Emma, we need to talk. Emma? Emma, hang on!
Emma, wait!
Emma, come back here!
We're all really worried about you, Emma!
Emma, we just want to talk!
Emma, we're trying to help you.
Emma, stop!
Wait. We just want to talk.
Emma, we really need to talk.
No more talking.
We just want to talk.
No more talking.
No more... talking!
: Emma, what have you done?
Oh, my God!
Emma! Emma!
 Em...
: 
: 
Emma!
Wake up, honey! Wake up!
Stop. Wake up.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
No, no, no. Hey...
Okay.
Oh, honey... It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.
: 
They always end with my hands covered in blood.
 But this time was different.
This time, I woke up in the kitchen holding a knife.
I'm sure if I'd been able to sleep, I would've had nightmares too.
Last night was insane.
Audrey's insane.
I-I can't...
I don't want to see her.
I don't want to see her either.
I've never felt like this before, ever.
I feel so betrayed.
You know we don't have to go to school, right?
We could just ditch. No one would blame us.
No, I have to find Noah.
I have to find out how the hell all of this happened.
Are you gonna get that?
No.
See, this is why people think you're creepy.
Do you think I'm creepy?
Yes.
But you say nice things to me, and I think you smell kinda good.
So, who's creepy now?
Still you.
Oh, my God. My head feels like cement.
Yeah, you were pretty wasted last night.
I think I still am.
Do you remember much?
Just the public meltdown where I called my dad a liar.
I told the whole town they basically deserved to die.
Do you think there's anybody who doesn't hate me right now?
I don't hate you.
We can't do this.
We already did do this.
I'm serious.
I just...
Jake?
He's still here, you know?
I just don't think I can do this until I know what happened to him.
I get it.
I'm gonna shower. You'd better go right back out that window before my dad finds you.
I'm serious. Go!
I'm too hungover for this.
Okay.
I don't understand. Audrey?
Yeah. It's unreal.
All that stuff about Piper, everything that she said... it was just a lie?
Yes.
Right to our faces, every day.
Hey, you guys. Enjoyed your freak show at the carnival last night.
Give it a rest, Hayley.
People are idiots.
Yeah, you'd think I'd be used to it.
Hey! There he is.
What the hell is wrong with you, huh?
How long have you known, Noah?
A few days. I'm so sorry I didn't say anything.
No, you are not sorry. You promised Audrey that you wouldn't tell me.
I thought that she should be the one to tell you.
I know everything now because I heard everything that you recorded, Noah!
You heard that? How did you...?
Someone sent me an email.
Can I see that email, please?
"Secret Friend"?
Yeah, it's obviously fake.
But imminently traceable.
Look, Audrey has just been destroyed...
Audrey's been destroyed?
Noah, our friends were being killed, and she didn't say anything to anyone, including you!
Emma...
No.
No, look, I just want...
Let her be.
Emma, I didn't know it was Piper!
Oh, my God!
Yes, you did! You just didn't want people to blame you!
That is not true!
It is! It is true!
And guess what? Everyone should blame you.
I blame you!
Come on. Let's get out of here.
You're right. I shouldn't have come to school today.
Just get your stuff and let's get out of here.
Oh, my God.
"Oh, it's okay. She'll forgive you, just like I did."
That is what you said to me, Noah. Like, four hundred times!
Because that's what I thought! Seriously!
I could never imagine that it would go this bad.
Yeah, well, I did! Okay?
You've never felt Emma's rejection!
It's hardcore! And, now, she hates me and Kieran hates me and Brooke hates me.
And there's no coming back from this.
I'll talk to her.
Like that'll work. She doesn't trust you either.
I know. She thinks I'm the one who sent her the audio file.
You too? Seriously?
Why did you record our conversation?
That's weird. And you kept pushing me to tell her everything.
Audrey, I promise you, I recorded our conversation by accident!
Did you send it by accident, too?
I didn't send it to her!
You are un-hackable! That is what you always tell me!
So, what is it? What am I supposed to think?
That-That's... I...
Someone sent that file.
Someone with access to your computer in your room... which is a very small list of suspects, by the way!
Okay, now, you're just being mean.
Aside from me and your mother, who else has been in your room?
It was not Zoe. Okay?
She would never do anything like that!
God! Come on, Foster!
If it were anyone else, you'd have her tracked all over your murderboard.
Stop it! You don't know what you're talking about!
You have no idea! You have no clue!
Hiding out in an empty classroom? Not cool, guys.
Sorry, Mr. Kaufman.
We were just practicing sonnets.
But we should probably go.
My house, after school.
I'll prove to you it's not Zoe.
Once we play this tape, we can't unplay it.
And you know that there's something horrible on there.
Most likely, but we need to hear it.
Yeah.
Yeah... I have to play it.
: 
: 
: 
Okay? I really need you to give me some space,
That was at the Grindhouse.
I had no idea that she was recording that.
: 
I'm currently a target for her paranoia and aggression.
After witnessing her attack on Hayley Meyers and the vandalism of my office, it's evident that Emma has seriously violent tendencies.
She needs me?
She's obviously obsessed with you.
Must be diligent about rebuilding my...
Is that how people see me? As violent? Unstable?
No. You can't take this stuff seriously.
Lang was stalking you, but this tape came from the killer.
No, but I-I did those things. I lost control. I exploded.
God, I... I almost shot you last night, Kieran.
This is not a normal situation, Emma.
Anyone would react this way.
You've been manipulated.
Okay, so... that audio file Emma received, it definitely did come from my blog bin.
I can't deny that.
Would you stop giving me "the look"?
Prove me wrong.
Why is she here?
He asked me to come over.
Although, now, I'm wondering why.
Hey, great! How about you wonder downstairs?
Hey! You want to know who sent Emma that file? So do I.
And, if someone somehow hacked into the Fortress of Solitude, then Zoe can help us figure out who and how.
Wait, someone hacked you?
Yeah.
What did they take?
Oh, yes, please keep playing dumb.
You asked for this.
I think you pirated a very sensitive file from Noah's computer and sent it to Emma.
Okay, and why would I do that?
To make me think it was Noah, cause a rift between us, get me out of the picture.
I'm not stupid, Audrey. You're obviously impossible to get out of the picture.
No wonder Noah's still a virgin.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for that to sound so...
Jealous?
'Cause it did.
She did this and there's a very easy way to prove it.
Just go into your sent files and see if she sent it to herself.
Oh, that'll work.
Oh, my God. Shocking. Audrey had a good idea.
Noah, there's something that I should tell you.
It was you!
No, okay, I... I did send it, but only to myself.
I'm sorry! You know what a huge fan of The Morgue I am. I just...
I wanted to finish listening to it, but once I did, I deleted it.
I did not send it to anyone else, I swear!
And you expect us to believe this?
You're screwing with people's lives!
She's telling the truth.
Look, the file was sent from someone named "Secret Friend."
I got the thread off Emma's phone.
Who is Emma's secret friend?
No idea, but if I can hack into the ISP, I can probably find out who the account's registered to.
So...
I got an ID on the second body.
Body?
From the fire?
Oh.
Eddie Hayes, 24. He had an insulin pump implant.
I matched him to the serial number.
He was a clerk at the Crescent Palms Motel.
Something wrong?
What? No, I'm fine.
You don't seem fine.
You said you needed my help on this case.
And I do.
I've been through this.
It's not a normal case. If you want to stay objective, you're gonna have to find a way to deal with your personal stuff.
Stavo didn't come home last night.
I've been trying to call him, but he won't answer my calls.
Was he at school today?
Apparently.
Well, at least you know he's okay.
That's just it. I'm not so sure. Ever since...
Since when?
Phoenix.
It happened right after his mother died.
Stavo and his best friend, Kyle... somehow, they got a hold of my gun.
They were messing around with it and it went off.
And the boy, Kyle... got shot in the face.
Oh, my God.
Stavo called it in, but, by the time I got there, the boy was dead.
He must have been traumatized.
To see his friend die in front of his eyes like that...
He was cool as a cucumber.
He was drawing... in his notebook.
Drawing what?
Kyle... dying... dead...
There was a question as to how long the boy was bleeding before he called it in.
Ultimately, they ruled it an accidental death.
 We came to Lakewood for a fresh start, but, then, I found these in his room.
: What do we do? Do we just go in there and interrogate her?
It depends what kind of condition she's in.
The killer planted that tape for me.
There's clearly some connection with Ms. Lang.
Either she gave him that tape, or he took it.
That may be how she wound up here.
You can come back now.
Thanks.
She's under sedation at the moment, but is alert enough, when awake, to recognize faces and respond.
Her throat's a little raw from the breathing tube, so speech is difficult.
Still, I think she'll be very happy to know her students care.
So, just speak quietly. No sudden movements.
Kristin?
Kristin, you have a visitor.
I'll be right outside if you need me.
Okay.
Ms. Lang?
It's me, Emma.
How are you doing?
Can I get you something? Do you want some water?
Um...
Ms. Lang? Oh, my God, are you okay?
Oh, my God. Uh, excuse me?
: Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Move, move!
Kristin, are you with me?
Take a deep breath. Open the drip!
All right, take a deep breath. Try to relax.
What happened?
I... I don't know.
: All right, that's it. Nice and easy.
That was so...
Strange. Seriously strange.
She was so afraid of me.
I know.
I know they're saying she fell down the stairs, but I am feeling more and more like she was attacked.
Why did she say she needed me? What does that mean?
: Kristin Lang? Room 134?
Daisies...
Thank you.
This is gonna sound weird, but...
Brandon James used to call my mom "Daisy." Is that crazy?
Do you think it makes any sense that it would be connected?
With everything that's going on, no, not crazy.
What is it?
"Love, Piper"? This is from the killer.
We have to do something. We have to figure this out.
Oh, my God. He's messing with me, or Ms. Lang, or something.
Stay here.
I have an idea.
Excuse me! I'm sorry. She can't have visitors right now.
I just wanted to make sure she was okay.
She's fine. Thank you.
I'm going to the courthouse for my Council meeting.
Call me if you need me.
Will do, Chief.
Hey.
Wow! Where did you learn to do that?
Hack and error.
Yes, very impressive. Why are we wasting our time with this?
She emailed herself that file, then sent it to Emma with that "Secret Friend" dummy email account.
If I was going to do it, I wouldn't have done it that way.
Got it! I got it.
Here it is. It looks like the offending email address is registered to...
Zoe Vaughn?
I did not do it!
Where do you get off? It's your name!
If she said she didn't do it, Audrey, she didn't do it.
Why would I even put it in my name?
She pirated this file off your computer when you weren't looking.
That's serious.
Yes, it is, but you're also forgetting what this is all about.
She's lying about this!
No, no! Stop!
I get why this is so important to you.
I want to figure out who did this to me and Emma!
Audrey, finding out who sent that file to Emma is not gonna change what you did or how Emma feels about it.
I was gonna tell her.
Yeah, but you didn't.
And now that Emma knows, you have to deal with that and go talk to 
I'm s... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
No, you know what? You should've.
It's okay. You're right.
Audrey...
No! You know what?
I just need to figure out how to fix things with Emma!
That was rough.
Yeah. Yeah, it was.
Thank you.
For...?
For having my back.
I, um...
I really appreciate it.
Yeah, I mean, I was...
I wa... I just... I really believed you were telling the truth.
I was.
: 
Virgin? Seriously? Where did you learn to do that?
 It's a terrible movie, but one hell of a s*x scene.
Should we be doing this?
We have to start somewhere.
Wow. This is exactly what I thought Ms. Lang's house would look like.
You thought about what it would look like?
What are we looking for?
Anything suspicious, I guess.
Her bag.
I'm gonna look over here.
Did you find anything?
No.
How about you?
No.
I don't know. Maybe there's something at school?
Because this is a complete waste of time.
It's the neighbor.
Why is that picture upside down?
Kieran...
Look at this. Piper and Lang...
They knew each other.
If they were friends... and you killed Piper... that would explain her obsession with you.
What I don't get is how the killer even knew about the recording in the first place.
And what would he gain by implicating me? Unless this is about us.
Oh, no. Zoe, I might have gotten you involved. I'm so sorry.
No, I got myself involved, okay? I would do it again.
But... how did he even know I was into you?
It was pretty obvious.
Really?
Yeah! Anyone watching would have seen it.
What?
Oh, crap.
What?
No. No! No, no, no!
How could I have missed that?
What? What's wrong?
It's bugged!
What is?
The camera in the storage unit. The killer put it there.
That's how he knew about the recording. He hasn't been watching us.
He's been listening! He knew I would take it.
He's heard everything!
It was hanging upside down?
Yeah. Someone meant for us to find this.
How would anyone know we were coming?
I don't know.
Blessed Sisters Children's Home?
Yeah, I think that's nearby.
I remember hearing weird stories about it when I was a kid.
Well, I know we're both mad at him right now, but you know who's an expert on weird stories?
Oh, yeah, I know Blessed Sisters. I can't believe Piper was there.
That place is notorious.
What do you mean, "notorious"?
Uh, it was a group foster home until ten years ago, but before that, it was an insane asylum.
I mean, you should hear what they say about the lobotomy labs on the third floor.
Noah, focus.
Right. Uh...
Uh, it closed down after an abuse scandal.
Something about instructors and kids in the attic.
Well, Ms. Lang and Piper both grew up there.
What? That is one piece of the Piper puzzle I could never find.
How did you...?
It's a long story.
But it ends with, we're going there now.
: 
Yeah. I'll meet you there.
We'll meet you there.
Right, uh, we will meet you there.
Uh... okay.
What the hell? I thought I told you no more coed sleepovers.
I'm not amused. You need to leave.
You needed to know about Jake.
Where did you get this?
Cops. Your dad and Jake had business.
Jake was gonna burn down a building for him.
This was the night he died... the last night we were together.
What else did you find?
Don't "honey" me. Don't say anything.
You hired Jake... to burn down your stupid failed development.
Brooke... you're not making sense.
Don't even!
You got him to do your dirty work, and it was the last night of his life.
And you didn't tell the sheriff?
Brooke, I couldn't tell...
You sat next to me while I cried my eyes out and you said nothing!
How did you find out?
What does it matter how I found out?
Jake would still be alive if it wasn't for you.
You drove my mom away. You killed my boyfriend.
What kind of father are you?
What do you want now?
If you want to come pick up the pieces, here's the address.
No...
Somebody's throwing a party.
: What the hell is this?
Why are people wearing Brandon James masks?
What's going on here?
Looks like a harmless act of teenage rebellion to me.
Noah, when was the last time you heard of a party being held at Blessed Sisters Children's Home?
Yeah, the timing is super weird.
Excuse me.
Hey! Do you know who's throwing this party?
Yeah, totally. It's such a cool idea.
The "screw you" of it all.
"Face the fear. Take back the night."
I never would've thought you'd have it in you.
Me? You think that I'm throwing this party?
Well, yeah. You and Audrey Jensen.
What?
Come on, Noah, answer.
It had to be the killer. He's trying to set me and Audrey up for something.
That's why he sent that invite.
And these people just blindly bought into it.
It's like they've never seen 
 or 
Accepting an invitation to a mysterious party practically ensures a grisly death.
Isn't 
 the one where everything turns out to be a prank in the end?
Not if you've seen the alternate ending.
Foster, focus.
We need to figure out a way to shut this party down right now.
That's definitely gonna be as easy as it sounds.
I can call Sheriff Acosta.
I'll tell him there's underage drinking.
It's not really a party without the music, or the lights.
Zoe Vaughan, you are brilliant. We'll shut down the electricity.
We just need to find the source.
: That's a great idea.
Go. Figure it out.
Kieran, it's Hayley. Do you think that she threw this party?
Sheriff Acosta, it's Kieran Wilcox.
Hey.
Emma!
Wow, I'm surprised you showed.
Are you a part of this thing?
You should know. It's your party.
Can I offer you a mask?
No, you can give me an explanation.
Uh, who sent out that invite and why was my name on it?
Okay, calm down. It's just a joke.
I said I'd help out.
Help who out?
A friend.
A very special friend, who prefers to remain anonymous.
And I protect my friends. Surely, you can respect that.
Hayley, do you realize you might be protecting a killer right now?
Who is your friend?
Stop being so paranoid!
It's someone I'm seeing.
Hayley, wait!
Hayley!
Sorry. Excuse me.
Audrey!
: 
Audrey! Hey, stop!
Audrey! Did you know about this party?
No, no.
Okay.
Look, someone set it up to make it look like we planned this. You and me.
Okay, then it was probably the killer.
I know!
That's what I'm trying to tell you. He led me here.
Did Noah come with you? Is he here?
Yeah, he's here with Zoe.
Why?
The killer just called me. Noah's his next target.
Hey there, stranger.
Miss me?
I was starting to think we'd never get any alone time.
No need for the silent treatment.
Everything worked out perfect. They all showed up, just like you wanted.
I guess I'll just have to find somewhere else to put my lips.
They're not labeled. How do we know which breaker controls that giant room?
We don't.
That's why we're gonna have to turn off all of them.
Okay.
Emma! Emma!
: Emma!
This is not good. We need to find Noah.
This is fine. This means Zoe and Noah are still alive.
They were gonna try and figure out a way to turn off the lights and stop the party.
Okay, then we need to find him. We need to get him out of here.
I know that!
Did the killer just do this because...
Because you're the last person I want to be stuck with right now?
Yes!
Yeah, probably.
Kieran...
Noah!
Emma! Emma!
Emma!
Emma!
Kieran?
Noah!
Noah?
Hey, hold up. What's that? On the wall.
Kieran?
Noah?
Oh, my God.
Who is that?
God...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, it's Piper!
I know what you're thinking.
That this... all of this... is my fault.
And you're right. It is. I know that.
And the killer knows that. He's throwing Piper's dead body in my face.
The killer wanted us to find Piper's body together... because we both killed Piper.
And, now... he wants revenge on both of us.
 I know you didn't throw the party.
No. Someone's just trying to make it look that way.
Do you have any information at all?
Yes, you need to talk to Hayley Meyers.
She said that she helped someone throw this party.
Did she give you a name?
No, she just said it was... a very special friend.
And I think that friend is the killer.
Sheriff...
There's something you need to see right away.
You're late.
I'm sorry.
Sparing no expense, I see.
 I couldn't be home, and I didn't want to be alone.
Me neither.
It's my mom's special place.
For special friends?
: Hayley Meyers...
A very special friend...
