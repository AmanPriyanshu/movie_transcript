grow, so the pisonia trees develop seeds that are sticky and equipped with hooks.\\n', 'By the time the young noddies leave, they carry these hitchhiking seeds away to other islands.\\n', 'But sometimes the pisonia trees are too successful.\\n', 'If a fledgling, testing out its wings, drops to the ground, it can get covered with the seeds.\\n', \"Entangled and weighed down, if it can't free
