Chris! What's going on?
There's a pod of dolphins beached up the coast.
One was too weak to send back out so we brought her here.
Will she be all right?
The vet's going to do an assessment once we've finished the rescue.
I've got to get back out there, there's dozens of them.
Hey, Chris, you ready to go?
Yeah, I got all the extra equipment you requested.
I'll give you a hand.
No, look, I need you to hold the fort here.
Just keep an eye on that sick dolphin for us.
I think I'll be more help out there.
I'm sorry, Karl.
We're short staffed. We need you here.
What about Mimmi? She could give Karl a hand.
Me?
Look, you don't mind leaving your toy cart for a little while, do you, Mimmi?
I... I guess not.
Terrific. Just do what Karl says.
Okay, let's go.
Hey.
Hey.
I can't stay.
Ondina's giving me a moon ring lesson.
Another one?
She says a few more lessons and I'll be a moon ring expert.
What?
Nothing... Nothing, I... I'm sure she's right.
I have to learn how to use this, Zac.
Getting a moon ring was the greatest honor of my life.
I don't want to waste it.
I know. I know.
It's just...
It might take more than a few lessons... especially with Ondina.
Ondina's a great teacher.
She said so herself, right?
She wants to teach me.
Just be careful, okay, because these things pack a punch.
And I don't want you turning into a frog by accident.
Would you rather I turn into a frog on purpose?
Do you want something to eat?
I can't.
We can catch up later.
Don't wanna risk upsetting the teacher.
I wanna hear all about it.
Project the energy of the moon ring into the object... and return.
I can already do that.
A little revision doesn't hurt.
Well, I was hoping we could try something a little more challenging.
Are you sure you're ready? After last time?
I made a mistake. It won't happen again.
Moon rings are dangerous without proper training.
She's lucky you're here then.
It would be irresponsible of me to push you too hard.
Makes it easier for Ondina, too.
Excuse me?
If you stick to the basics, there's less chance you'll embarrass yourself.
I would have no problem teaching Evie the most difficult moon ring magic... if she was ready.
I am.
I promise.
Fine.
Let's move on from basic levitation.
The principle is the same.
Project the moon ring power into the object... and let it do the rest.
Wow. 
That's cool.
You never know when you'll need to lift underwater boulders or help stranded sailors.
When have you ever helped a stranded sailor?
There are plenty of other places you could hang out.
I might have a moon ring myself one day.
I'm staying to watch the great teacher at work.
Your turn.
: First of all, you'll need a wetsuit.
: For what?
: I need you to clean the pool.
You want me to get into the water?
You can swim, can't you?
Uh... yeah.
Can't we just leave them in the water?
No, we can't.
They go in that barrel... I'll help.
Actually... I'll be fine on my own.
You must have other things to do.
I'll go check on the sick dolphin.
I'll see you later.
: Good.
Stay focused. You're doing fine.
Now, slowly move your hand away.
 I did it.
 Excellent work.
Uh-oh.
Don't worry.
Ah, it's falling!
Use the moon ring again.
 It's not working.
Concentrate!
Show it who's boss.
What's happening?
Um...
Well, I would say that you've made progress.
Ondina, I'm so sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
Just bring me down.
Okay.
Good effort, Evie. Um, let's... let's try it again.
I can't do this!
Yes, you can.
I don't know how!
 I'm so glad I stayed.
Hey, girl. How are you doing?
I wish I could understand you.
What are you doing here?
I finished at the pool.
What's wrong with her?
No idea.
Why is she bumping the gate to the next pool?
She must be stressed.
Oh, I think it's more than that.
: We can't do anything until the vet arrives.
The school group's here.
You can help me make sure no one wanders off.
If you can't get down, we could always use you as a chandelier.
Keep calm. Focus the power of the ring.
I can't do it.
Take a breath and try again.
I don't want to!
Allow me to help.
Argh! What was that?
Whoa!
Thanks for the help.
I'm so sorry.
Forget sorry! Get us down!
Killer sharks!
Which one swims the fastest?
The shortfin mako.
And it may surprise you to know not all sharks are killers.
Some sharks can be dangerous, but most are no threat to humans... as long as we respect them.
So, can you play with them, like dolphins?
Sharks are top-level predators.
Cool.
The point is, they're not toys.
Actually, some sharks can be very playful, once you get to know them.
Really?
Sometimes sharks race each other, just for fun.
Why don't you guys see how many types of fish you can identify?
Mimmi? Can I have a word?
Sharks race each other? Are you trying to make me look stupid?
It's true.
There's years of research behind that theory, is there?
Plenty of documented proof?
Not exactly.
Here at the Marine Park, we deal in proven scientific fact.
Look, I was only trying to help.
You want to help?
Fine. Come on.
All you need to do is hand feed them.
Do you think you can manage that?
Do you have any rubber gloves?
Have you caught a whiff of those?
Okay, gloves. Anything else?
Sorry, I don't speak Southern Penguin, but do any of you speak Northern Penguin?
: Whoa!
Ah, wrong way. I said down, not up!
Stop yelling at me. I'm doing my best!
Oh! This... this is hopeless.
I'll get Mimmi.
No, Evie--
She'll know what to do.
: Evie! No!
No, Evie! Evie!
Stop!
Evie, stay with us! Evie!
What if Mimmi can't get us down?
She won't have to. I will.
How?
I'm thinking. Don't interrupt.
Sure, I... I'll leave you alone.
Oh, wait, I can't because I'm floating six feet off the ground.
: Good, huh?
Sardines are my favorite, too.
Come on, get it while it's fresh.
Here you go, eat up.
Oh, no, I don't think so.
You've already been back for seconds... and thirds.
And you thought I wasn't counting.
That poor dolphin doesn't sound good.
Mimmi?
Where are you going?
I think the dolphin's in pain.
The dolphin's not your problem.
Come on, the penguins won't feed themselves.
Can't you use your moon ring to get us down?
I asked you not to interrupt.
Got it.
Finally. What?
Evie over-energized us.
All we need to do is neutralize the energy.
Of course.
It's so obvious.
Why didn't I think of that?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I zap you with my moon ring.
You zap me with Evie's.
The two forces will cancel each other out.
Slight problem.
Mmm?
Evie's moon ring is down there. We're... up here.
Easily fixed.
I'll make it come to me.
Oh.
You meant to do that, right?
Ondina, talk to me!
 It should have come to me.
Evie's moon ring must have messed with my magic.
Let me try. 
Hey, Evie.
Have you seen Mimmi?
I'm good. How are you?
Sorry. It's an emergency.
An emergency, hey?
Luckily for you, the Camster is here.
What do you need me to do?
Mimmi hasn't been in today.
Maybe she's at work?
Of course. 
You're welcome.
Always happy to help.
Sorry, guys. Kitchen's closed.
Hey, girl.
I know you're in pain, but I can't help you unless you tell me where.
Oh, what does "all over" mean?
Mimmi?
What's the problem?
Can you tell me where it hurts?
You're kidding!
What? Right now?
 You try!
 Okay.
It's no use.
Why don't we wait until Mimmi gets back?
She's at work.
She won't be back for hours. We... we have to keep trying.
Even if we get the moon ring, I can't use it.
Always with the negative.
You're the one who goes on and on about how hard they are to master and how dangerous they can be if you're not properly trained.
I may have exaggerated.
They're still dangerous.
 You'll be fine.
I'll give you a crash course.
See... that's the part I'm worried about.
: Karl!
You can't just walk off the job, Mimmi! Where were you?
At the dolphin pool.
I told you, the dolphin's not your problem.
She's pregnant!
What?
But she's not in full term, she's in premature labor!
Where are you getting this from? There's no way you could know that.
Please. You have to believe me.
Like I had to believe that sharks hold swimming carnivals?
No. Listen--
Mimmi, you've made it very clear you aren't interested in helping.
So, you go back to your toy cart and let me get on with it.
I get that you don't like me, and I get that you think I know nothing, but what if I am right?
And what if there's a problem with the birth?
Can you afford to take that risk?
Get your foot out of my face!
Hang on. I'm getting into position.
I think I can reach it! 
Nice show. You should join the circus.
Okay. Give me a push.
You're gonna show me how it's done?
Probably.
No, no, no, no, no! 
Go on. Say it.
What?
You never miss a chance to rub it in my face.
I'm sure you're thinking up some biting one-liner.
Actually, I was thinking it's kind of cool how hard you keep trying, even though the situation is clearly hopeless.
Oh... thanks.
Don't mention it.
Mimmi?
: I guess she does look a little swollen.
The dolphin in the next pool, does she have a baby?
Yeah. Heidi calved last summer.
Well, dolphins like to be with other moms when they give birth.
That's why she's been bumping the gate.
Could be.
Let her through, Karl. Please.
She needs to be with the others.
Please.
I'm not authorized. We should wait for Dr. Ross.
It might be too late.
Okay.
: Hey! How did the rescue go?
Good. We got the rest of the pod back out to sea.
That's fantastic news.
And how are things here? Any problems?
Uh... not exactly.
That dolphin that you brought in, she wasn't sick.
She was in premature labor.
What?
I knew it was a risk, but I opened the gate and let her join Heidi.
And it turned out fine.
Heidi gave her all the help she needed, and now we've got a new female baby calf.
Well, I'm impressed.
I'll go check on them. Well done, Karl.
Actually, it was--
Mimmi!
I need you right now!
Do you mind if I...
It's cool. You've earned it.
I guess I had her figured wrong.
For a girl who works at the toy cart... she knows an awful lot.
What do you mean?
She was the one who knew the dolphin was pregnant and in labor.
Not me. It was her call.
Really?
How?
I was gonna ask you the same question.
Almost there... almost.
When was the last time you changed your socks?
Okay. A little... further.
A little lower.
 Ah, got it!
Good work.
You too.
Now what?
Put it on.
We need to bring our moon rings together at exactly the same time, and focus our energy on each other.
Okay.
I'll count to three.
One... two--
Wait! Are we going on three or after three?
On three.
Right. Got it. 
One... two--
Wait!
If this doesn't turn out...
I just want you to know that... you're okay.
Mostly.
Gee, thanks.
You're mostly okay, too... when you're not interrupting me.
Can we go now?
One... two... three.
Are you okay?
I heard a crash.
Evie said you guys had a problem.
Does it look like we have a problem, Weilan?
No. No problem here.
How... did it go?
So, what have you been up to today?
Uh... not much, really.
This and that.
Go on.
Uh... I went home.
Did some study. Kicked a ball around.
Played some video games. Pretty boring, really.
No, it's interesting.
What else have you been doing?
Stop avoiding the question.
And what question is that?
About your day.
My day?
Yeah.
The moon ring lesson.
Are you a master yet?
Not quite. 
There were a few hiccups.
Such as?
Let's just say, these things are harder to use than I thought.
You'll get the hang of it.
It was amazing.
I... I've never seen a dolphin give birth before.
I can't believe you figured out she was in labor.
Nobody else picked it.
Uh... female intuition.
I think it's something more than that.
I just looked at her and... I had this feeling.
It was a lucky guess, really.
Mimmi, it's me.
You don't have to be modest. I know you're special.
I mean, I know you have some kind of special connection with dolphins.
Come on, you can tell me. How did you figure it out?
Honestly?
I asked her.
 Yeah, sure.
Ah, you almost had me there!
You feel like something to eat?
Sounds great.
Okay.
