Dolphins are very sensitive. So take good care of her, okay?
I never thought I could get a dolphin to do a double flip, but Heidi finally did it.
Heidi thinks you're great. She would do anything for you.
Did she tell you that?
Dolphins can tell when you've got a good heart.
It's one of the things I like about you.
So... what do you have planned for your day off?
Not much.
Well, how about we go to the beach?
Just us?
Yeah. Just us.
 Yeah, I'd like that.
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
: Finders, keepers.
: No.
This is the biggest tip I've ever had.
That's the guy who's opening the new hotel.
Supposed to be a very cool design.
The kind of place celebrities hang out?
Could be.
I hope they come here. And bring all their friends.
Why would those kind of people come here?
Guess what?
Mimmi's got a date.
What!
She's going to the beach with Chris tomorrow.
Are you out of your mind?
He asked and I said yes.
Do I really need to explain all the problems with a mermaid going to the beach?
She likes him. I say go for it.
How do you know you can trust him?
I'm not going to tell him I'm a mermaid.
And anyway, Cam and David kept our secret, why can't Chris?
What about the people he works with?
He lets slip to somebody what you are, you end up the Marine Park's major exhibit, and we have to pay to visit you.
You're overreacting. Chris wouldn't tell... he's a good person.
You don't know what he's really like.
You never do, until it's too late.
Look... find a way to get out of this, Mimmi.
It's for the best.
Believe me.
: No more beach wear?
We're going upmarket to attract a more sophisticated clientele.
: Like that hotel guy?
Exactly.
And sophisticated people want an upmarket dining experience, so that means tapas.
 Tapas?
It's Spanish for finger food.
It's all the rage.
You really should consult me about changes like this.
That's what I'm doing now. We can't waste any time.
We need to change our image, carve out a niche in the market before someone else beats us to it.
It's a big risk.
They're the only kind worth taking.
Yes?
Hi.
Is Mimmi here?
No.
I'll let her know you called.
: Ooh! Chris!
Hi. Mimmi's coming.
: Hi.
Hey.
Let's go.
Okay.
Have fun!
Bye. 
So, uh... you ready to hit the water?
Ah, I'd rather warm up a bit first.
But you go. Have fun.
What do you think you're doing?
Looking after Mimmi.
She's not a hatchling, you know.
She can look after herself. Leave her alone, okay?
Hey. The water's awesome.
 Uh...
Stop it!
He's going to wet her!
Ondina!
You need to calm down.
Come on, I'll buy you an ice cream.
Come on, let's go.
Come on!
So... are you ready to come in now?
Actually, it's pretty hot.
I wouldn't mind getting off the beach.
Okay, let's go for a walk.
Thank you. Sorry, no chocolate.
Ondina?
Oh, great.
Why did it take you so long to ask me out?
Well, I was scared you'd say no.
: You don't have to be scared with me.
So, do you want to get something to eat?
Uh...
I've got a better idea.
: What are you doing?
Redecorating.
Just for tonight... until I can find a more permanent solution.
You won't be able to see my shop.
That's the point.
Racks of bikini bottoms kind of lower the tone.
Since when?
Since Cam decided to go upmarket and ditch everything that makes the Ocean Café the Ocean Café.
: But that's why people come here.
You're going to put off the old customers.
And attract new, sophisticated ones.
Maybe you could redecorate.
Maybe get some... classier stock.
It's a surf shop.
What do you want me to sell? Evening wear?
Could you?
You're crazy!
What's with the black clothes?
: New look for the café, new look for the staff.
I'll make this work, you'll see.
Thank you.
So, food now?
Not just yet.
Let's look at the view.
: You know, all my life I've been attracted to the sea.
It's such an amazing world we know so little about.
Mmm-hmm, you're right about that.
: I remember when I was a kid, I used to dive off my parents' yacht and I'd swim down the bottom.
And I'd just lie there on my back, looking up at the surface, like I was a fish, looking out at the human world.
You probably think that's pretty silly.
No.
I think it's sweet.
Where did that come from?
: Oh, it's just a squall. It'll be gone in a sec.
I'm sorry.
Mimmi?
Mimmi!
Mimmi?
: The storm came out of nowhere.
There wasn't time to say anything to Chris.
I just had to run.
An instant storm.
How weird.
Isn't that weird, Ondina?
Something was bound to go wrong.
I did warn you.
 I know.
What was I thinking?
You were thinking that you like Chris and he likes you.
Nothing wrong with that now. Is there, Ondina?
Except that it was never going to work.
You were right, Ondina.
I was behaving like a hatchling in love.
Dating a land boy only means trouble.
Happy now?
Why did you have to ruin it for her?
You heard Mimmi...
A land boy means trouble. I was protecting her.
What you did at the park was way beyond that.
What I did was save Mimmi a lot of grief.
I know how these things end up.
She's better off without him, trust me.
This isn't about Chris, is it?
If you've come to have a go at me, forget it.
I'm doing this. I can make it work.
People are used to how the place is, Cam.
They don't want change.
Look... people think I'm just Cam.
The goofy guy that likes eating burgers.
But I bought into the café because... I wanted to put my stamp on it.
Make it better.
And I know you and David have your doubts, but...
I can do this. I can.
Just... have a little faith in me.
Okay.
Erik said he cared about me.
That all he ever wanted was to protect me.
So I trusted him.
In the end, he let me down.
: That must have been awful.
But that was just you and one boy. One experience.
The point is, you can never be sure how things will turn out.
Even if Chris turned out to be like Erik...
Mimmi would never thank you for interfering.
I'm not interfering...
I'm protecting her.
You can't protect her forever.
Mimmi has to make her own mistakes.
Like you did.
And you have to let her swim her own path.
Hi.
I wanted to return this.
Is Mimmi all right?
She ran off.
Yeah, about that...
Look--
Can you just tell her that if she doesn't want to see me, it's okay.
I just thought we were getting on really well, and I think she's a fantastic person, but...
I guess you can't make someone like you back, can you?
Anyway, I just hope she's all right.
You know what you have to do now, don't you?
Are you okay?
Just... wish things could have been different.
Maybe they could have been, if it wasn't for me.
The reason it went wrong with Chris is because I made sure it did.
The storm in the park?
That was me.
But... why would you do that?
It's Erik.
He left me feeling like I'd been hit in the stomach by a hammerhead shark.
I just wanted to make sure you didn't go through that.
I can't believe you ruined my date.
I know it was wrong and I am so sorry.
But if you like Chris... you should go for it.
It's too late.
No!
He really likes you.
There's only one way to find out if you can trust him... and that's to keep seeing him.
Maybe one day you can tell him your secret.
And, in the meantime, I'm pretending to be someone I'm not.
That's not fair on him.
You were right, Ondina.
It can't ever work between us.
: 
Hi, Evie.
The place looks amazing.
Thanks.
: I told Zac I'd meet him here. I thought I'd be late.
So what time does this thing kick off anyway?
Cam?
What's the point?
Anyone that was going to come is already here.
No use letting the food go to waste.
It cost a fortune.
This night meant so much to Cam.
He only came up with the idea yesterday.
But he still put his heart and soul into it.
Where's a rent-a-crowd when you need one, huh?
Good idea.
Hmm?
: I think I've scared Mimmi off boys for life.
I though that's what you wanted?
Yeah, well, thanks to you, I now realize that was a big mistake.
Sorry?
You made me realize I hadn't put the past behind me, so, thank you.
 What?
Thank you.
 I so like hearing you say that.
We have to find a way to get Mimmi and Chris back together.
Have you got an Eastern spell to undo everything I said to her?
Would a fancy night at the café do instead?
Evie called.
Cam's got something special happening.
How is that going to help?
Well, they still like each other, right?
So we put them in the same place, with a bit of music, dancing... no other spell required.
Great.
Okay, so how do we get Chris there?
He won't go if we ask him.
Mmm-mmm.
But... if his friend Karl went, and Chris tagged along...
How do we make sure Karl goes?
There is one person I know Karl would do anything for.
: I'm not in the mood.
A night out is exactly what you need. It'll cheer you up.
Plus, Evie sounded desperate.
Cam really needs us there.
One less won't make any difference.
I don't want to go without you.
I'll have to spend the night talking to her.
Yes. Please save us from that.
: Please come.
Just think about it, okay?
I just... really thought I could do something with this place.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You gave it a shot, but the café is what it is.
I know.
Shorts and T-shirts.
Sand on the floor.
Toasties and juice.
 And that's why everyone likes it.
But every now and then... a bit of change is a good idea, too.
What is that?
Come and see.
 How... how did you...
Well, Evie and I called everyone that we know, and then they called everyone that they knew, and hey!
Instant crowd.
Whoa, it does look good.
It's your idea, just... tweaked a bit.
Well, at least I gave you something to work with.
You know what I like best about you?
I always admit when I'm wrong?
Eventually.
You never stop trying.
: I don't think Mimmi's coming.
Short of dragging her here, I don't know what else we could have done.
You look lovely.
Thanks.
Shall we?
What?
We made a deal.
I bring Chris and you dance with me.
One dance. No talking.
So, uh... do you want to dance?
Not really.
But I can see someone who might.
I might, um, go see who's over there.
Yeah.
Hi.
You realize we've been set up.
I was wondering why Karl was so keen for me to come here.
I'm not saying it's a problem, unless you think that it is.
No. It's fine.
Can we, uh... go outside and talk?
: Chris...
I'm sorry I ran off.
 You don't have to apologize.
I realize I was rushing you into something you weren't ready for.
No. That's not it.
Oh, well, something you're not interested in.
Well, that's not it, either.
So, you are interested?
Yes... 
 but it's complicated.
Why?
I mean, if we like each other, then we like each other.
That's simple, isn't it?
Unless... you just want to be friends, and that's okay, too.
I'll see you at work.
That's not what I want.
What do you want?
