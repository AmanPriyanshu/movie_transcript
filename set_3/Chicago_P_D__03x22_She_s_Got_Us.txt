Easy peasy... Doc patches you up, you're back on patrol as soon as your Return to Work form clears.
All good. And me and Burgess, we'll be partners?
That's kind of a sticky wicket.

So we have to strategize. Let's go get some pancakes.

Both their daughters were in public high school.

Lastly, their daughter, Polly.
She's 12 years old.
She's our only survivor.
Darren used to work for the City Planning Department.
Jeni was a manager at a commercial printer.
They had about a dozen LLCs in their names.
Yeah, they were definitely hustlers.
Darren manages a few rental properties.
I got patrol knocking on doors right now.
We might just be looking for an aggravated tenant.
Yeah, Jeni was raising money to buy a fast food franchise.
I'm looking into their investors.
They also had a $50,000 advance from a company called Horizons.
Horizons?
That's a pyramid scheme.
They do these seminars to teach leadership skills, but it's a total scam.
So, we got nothing on the pod cameras yet, boss.
Neighborhood Watch didn't see anybody fleeing.
We got the .40 caliber shells left at the scene.
None of 'em match the ballistics database so far.
So it's either a single shooter or they only discharged the one weapon.
There was no sign of forced entry, so they knew who the killer was.
It's possible.
Look, what I want to understand is who exactly the Carlsons are in business with.
These people are scrambling to do right by their family.
Somewhere along the line, it went bad.
And let's not assume the kids are just collateral damage.
I mean, they got two teenage daughters.
The surviving daughter is our only eyeball witness.
She's on a three-day psych evaluation at Med.
Her aunt and uncle in St. Louis are her closest family.

Five years later, he was on our Implementation Committee.
You prosper, you pick up enemies.

What darkness?
His record was spotless.

So Horizons won't give us the members that Darren sold memberships to.
Uh-huh.
We had a guy in the Assets Forfeiture Unit look into it.

The Carlsons signed up everyone on that list, and then those people, they turn around and sell to the other suckers.
We're thinking there's a motive there.
Yep, and this guy here stands out.
Allan Sloan. Sent a few emails.
No death threats, necessarily, but close enough.
"You people cost me everything."
And he got popped for a drunk and disorderly, like, four days ago.
All right, find him. Get him in a room.

Where were you at 4:00 a.m.?
At my brother's bar, and then here on this very couch.
Okay.
Jeni and Darren Carlson.
Is that why you're here? You think that was me?

They sold me a Horizons seminar in Grand Rapids.
So I'm on stage there in front of 500 people, and they got this head shrinker there trying to help me "unlock my potential to create wealth."

Is that why you hurt the nurse?
I need to go to the house on the lake.
Okay.
Well, why don't we go to the house on the lake?
So, this house... she could be fixated.
You know, it's a coping mechanism, but the fixation could be based in reality or it could be entirely fictive.
Okay, which one do you think it is?
I don't know. You know, if it exists, it could be she's got some positive memory she wants to relive there.
And that could bring her back to reality.?
Possibly. I mean, I assume you got some other leads you're working on here.
Leads, yes. Witnesses, no.
Listen, about this morning.
I hadn't slept. I'm sorry.
This is your shop.
I should not tell you how to run it.
Erin, do not worry about it.
Everybody's just trying to do their job.
So, this house, you, uh, you think it exists?
I have absolutely no idea, but if it does, we're gonna find out.
At this time, this medical review board regrets to inform you that we will not be able to approve the surgical procedure Dr. Calloway suggests.
What the hell does that mean?
You got a problem with my doctor?
It's more complicated than that.
The bullet... it's buried back near the C5 nerve root.
You said you could get it out.
And I can, but removing it is unlikely to improve the sensory and motor deficits to your arm, and, well... the surgery could actually make them worse.
The damage condition is most likely going to be permanent.
You can't work patrol with a chronic condition.
I don't have a condition.
You don't know me. Ask my Sergeant.
Ask the Commander. I belong out on the streets.

Sloan's alibi checks out.
His brother and four others put him falling off a barstool at the time of the murders.
It's right before he was robbed too.
Strange timing.
Yeah.
What's even more strange is that his neighbor called about a car blocking her handicapped spot last night.
Right after the Carlson murders.
Plates belong to a security consultant employed by Horizons International.
Yeah, the guy's a former Cook County Sheriff.
Francis Kruger. Pretty big problem.
Got fired for a couple excessive force beefs.
You see Horizons as the nexus?
Sloan said that the only thing that was taken was his tablet computer, which he used to film a Horizons seminar.
Their aggressive tactics, et cetera, et cetera.
I mean, I think we got motive.
Sloan's a whistle blower.
The company breaks in his house, they steal whatever he's got on them.
I do want to tap the brakes just for a second because, I mean, are we saying that a self-help group robbed a guy, slaughters a family just to keep a lid on how they operate?
So we grab this guy and find out.
How's Lexi?
Uh, you know, threatening to take a year off before college.
She's calling it a "gap year."
"Gap year"?
Imagine trying to get that past your old man.
Imagine talking to my old man.
Hey, Francis Kruger.

What about the robbery?
What robbery?
Come on, Francis. You know this.
You tell us what happened, everything goes good for you.
We got you on the neighbor's security camera going into Allan Sloan's house 20 minutes after somebody murdered the Carlsons.
Your unit messed around with one of these back when you were with the Sheriffs, right?
But it work for you? I mean, you get confessions with this thing?
How long before we place you inside that Carlson house?
I mean, Sloan's gonna blow the whistle.
Horizon calls you in to, what, clean up, right?
I'll tell you what we can't crack.
How does the family figure in?
Three kids are dead. Not four.
You left the little girl alive.
And I'll tell you something else... she ID'd you.
Mm-hmm. From a photo array, in one second.
No way. Not possible.

But his father is registered to a .40 caliber handgun, so, I guess that could be the weapon.
Just so I got this right, are we saying that this kid killed 5 people for $800?
We find that gun, we'll know.
Kicked out of high school for attacking a teacher in a parking lot?
Why didn't I know this before?
Couldn't make the connection from a fight in a parking lot to a quintuple murder, Sarge.
And I said, "Find out why."
I know it's just $800, but it might have meant something to that kid.
I wanna look him in the eye and ask what.
Hey, I gotta find this house.
You don't have to do it alone.
You know I love a combo.
So what if the house on the lake wasn't a vacation spot?
I went through Darren's financials.
He managed a property down on 47th St.
That's Hyde Park.

My dad pretended it was an adventure.
But I knew it was because we didn't have anywhere to live.

I went to bed in Colorado once and woke up in Oregon.

Katie hated it.
She wanted to go to camp.
But I think my dad was right.
It was an adventure.
I'm gonna miss him so much.
Hey, Polly...
Have you ever met a person and just known that you didn't have to worry about them?
Like, no matter where they go, everything's gonna be okay?
I don't know.
I guess. (SNIFFLES)

Aunt Nancie and Uncle Marshall, this is Erin.
She's a detective.
She helped me a lot.
So, Doc, how did you know the girl was gonna remember the shooter?
I didn't.
Memory is thoroughly unpredictable.
Uh, for instance, what'd you have for lunch on Tuesday?
Turkey wrap, avocado, hot sauce.
Same thing every day.
Oh, fantastic.
Jay?
I don't know.
Well, okay, then how about the day you graduated from the academy?
24-ounce porterhouse, creamed spinach, onion rings.
24 ounces?
With the bone, sure.
Point is, memories imprint randomly.
Right? Positive, negative.
Things you wanna remember stay.
Things you want to forget disappear.
That's why they invented whiskey.
I suppose.
Yeah.
Hey, where were you?
I couldn't find you all afternoon.
Move to San Diego with me.
(LAUGHS) What?
Why not? I got a cousin there.
He lives a block from the beach, he said I could stay in his guest house.
So wait, wait, when did this plan come together?
I'm still working on it.
Look, they're pushing me out.
No way I'm working some office job.
I'll take my 75 and go.
I love you. Probably.
And you're the only thing around here I'd miss.
I... I don't know what to... I...
Don't say anything. Just think about it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
I'll call you later.
