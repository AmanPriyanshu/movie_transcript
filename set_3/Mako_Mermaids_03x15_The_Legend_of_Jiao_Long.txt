: The reef was gorgeous this morning.
Honestly, could this day be any better?
David could have put a bit more mango in this tropical juice.
More like a sub-tropical juice.
Hi, guys. Check this out.
 Sounds interesting.
It's a collection of treasures recovered from the deepest parts of the ocean.
The author's in town for 24 hours signing her book.
We have to go.
Okay. Weilan, you should come.
Sure. Why not?
Awesome. Well, that makes four of us.
Four?
Yeah, I invited Karl as well.
The more the merrier, right?
I am not going on a double-date with Karl!
Well, I'm not interested in a book signing.
Especially when it's about stuff I see every day.
Please, Ondina?
You never know. You might have a nice time with Karl.
I can't believe you just said that.
What's wrong with him?
Everything.
Then don't go.
But I already told Mimmi I would.
I didn't.
You're going to make me beg, aren't you?
Well, I would kind of like to see that.
Please come.
You call that begging?
: Hey, Weilan.
Ondina, I didn't know you were coming.
You sound disappointed.
No, no, I, um...
I just thought it was going to be the four of us.
: I did, too.
That's why I invited Ondina.
I couldn't stay away.
Love a good book signing.
Let's go in.
So some old guy's salvaged this from the sea?
Actually, it was all found by a woman and she's not much older than us.
"Cast iron statue of an Indian farm worker, 14th century.
Recovered from the Bay of Bengal at a depth of 2,500 meters."
I bet she's rich.
Why do you say that?
Deep sea diving needs resources.
She must have a submersible to get that deep, and they cost mega bucks.
She probably sells all the stuff she finds.
Well, according to this, she donates everything she finds to a foundation, and then they organize exhibitions of her discoveries all around the world.
I bet she makes a heap selling those.
Ladies and gentlemen... the extraordinary underwater explorer and writer of 
 is now ready to sign copies of her new book.
Please, take your place in line.
Come on, let's go.
Here she is. A big round of applause.
Welcome.
 Hi.
Thanks for coming.
Hello.
Thanks for coming.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, could you make it out to "Chris," please?
Thanks for coming.
Could we get a photo?
Sure.
Thank you.
Thanks.
: Hi.
: Thanks so much.
Excuse me, Ms. Chadwick.
The television crew is on their way.
All right.
Hi.
: So much of our planet is unexplored.
Most of the world is covered by water. We know so little about what's down there.
The pieces on display are just a sample of what I've found.
The full collection, which includes a number of large statues, will be arriving next month.
You are a great success story, Ms. Chadwick.
Local girl turned international celebrity.
What got you interested in diving?
I can honestly say that I woke up one day and decided that it was something I needed to do.
Your exhibition is called "Secrets of the Deep."
Do you have a secret?
Eight hours sleep and a good hair conditioner.
Thank you, Ms. Chadwick.
She comes from here?
Yeah.
In the book she says she got her start diving on Mako Island.
This is really beautiful.
: "Gold bracelet, Shan Dynasty.
Recovered from the East China Sea at a depth of 1,000 meters.
It is mentioned in the legend of Ji Long the dragon..."
Jiao Long the dragon.
Right.
Uh, "...where a water spirit defeated a dragon."
A water spirit.
: Yeah, what's that?
 A wet ghost?
We need to go.
Why?
There's something you need to see.
Ondina? Come on.
What?
Where are they going?
Mimmi!
What's going on?
Just... hang here, okay?
We'll be back soon.
What are we doing?
I've got a hunch.
About what?
Humor me, okay?
The Jiao Long Dragon?
It is not for sale.
I told my friends how lovely the painting is.
Could we see it? Please?
This painting is by a famous Chinese artist.
Very beautiful, yes?
Um... Uncle Shen, is there any chance we could have some of your wonderful tea?
Oh, uh... for three lovely ladies, it will be my pleasure.
 What are you now, an art critic?
Give me a sec.
: If that's Jiao Long...
Yes! The water spirit.
She's a mermaid.
Now look at her wrist.
It's the bracelet.
Mmm-hmm.
The exact same bracelet we just saw.
The legend says that a water spirit defeated a dragon.
What if the bracelet kills dragons?
So, basically, this chick cruises the world, goes down in her sub, brings up whatever she likes and gets paid for it?
What a life! 
: Yeah, it's great, except for the fact that if her equipment goes wrong at that depth, the water pressure is going to crush her flat in a second.
Well, everything has a downside.
We could grab it and run.
Maybe not.
That woman is too young to have collected all this.
It would take years and years to find them.
One of us could have managed it.
That reporter said she got her start on Mako.
You don't think she's a--
Well, if she is, she might help us.
So let's just go and ask her straight up if she's a mermaid.
That was a joke. 
Sorry, this is a private area. I'll be signing autographs later.
We just wanted to say how much we enjoyed the book signing.
Thank you.
The dragon bracelet is fascinating.
It is a lovely piece.
According to the legend, it belonged to a water spirit.
That is what the legend says. Now, would you mind...
A water spirit is another name for mermaid.
Really?
Yes.
Like you.
I have no idea what you're talking about. Now, would you mind...
I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.
How did you know?
I wasn't certain... until you did that.
So, you guys fell into the moon pool, too?
 She's a land girl, like Evie.
: You weren't always a mermaid, were you?
We are. We were born at sea.
Real mermaids?
I'm feeling pretty real. Right, girls?
What do you want?
That bracelet.
 It's not going to happen.
Our pod is being threatened by a dragon that could destroy us all.
That bracelet is our only hope.
A dragon?
I know it's hard to believe, but we're telling the truth.
If you think I'm just going to hand over a priceless artifact to a bunch of deluded teenagers, you're dreaming.
Excuse me. This is a restricted area.
I must ask you to leave. I'm so sorry, Ms. Chadwick.
It's quite all right. They were just going.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.
I've looked everywhere. They're not here.
Face it, mate, we've been ditched.
: Out you go, you three.
Hey! What happened in there?
: Did you break something?
No.
: Where did you go?
There was something we needed to do.
Can we go get something to eat now?
Sorry, we have to go again.
Why? What's going on?
I can't explain right now.
So when can you?
I'm sorry.
: What was that about?
: You can't be serious.
: Why not?
This whole idea is based on some centuries-old Chinese legend.
So?
 Come on, Weilan.
We're not living in a fairy tale.
Hello?
We're mermaids.
If there is even a remote chance that that bracelet can do what the legend says, we have to get it.
You're going to steal it?
That woman's not going to give it to us.
: We wouldn't be stealing.
It belongs to the Eastern pod. My people.
So, technically, it's not stealing at all.
And by destroying the dragon, we are making the oceans safe for all mermaids, including her.
So, really... we're doing her a favor.
Well, when you put it like that...
I've got to tell you, being a customer is way less stressful than being a boss.
: I'm sure the world of customer service mourns your departure.
Oh, ha-ha.
There you go.
: Thank you.
I've just got to make sure the new waitress is okay, and then I'm all yours.
I'm so lucky.
Better believe it.
If you help, we get out of here sooner.
They're helpless without me.
Hey, Zac.
Do you mind if I have a word?
Sure. What's up?
You seem to know Mimmi pretty well, right?
Yeah. So?
I just can't make any sense of her.
Every time I think we're getting close, she shuts me out, and I'm starting to wonder if she actually likes me.
 Trust me. She does.
I'm not so sure.
Look, I can honestly say she has never liked any guy as much as you.
Then why do I get the feeling she's hiding something from me?
Search me. Who knows what she thinks?
Well, I was hoping you do.
Look, let's forget it.
I was just trying to get a straight answer, but I guess not.
There is nothing going on. 
Mimmi's just an ordinary girl. No secrets there.
I have an assignment I need to finish. I'll see you.
See you, Zac.
I presume this is not a social call.
We need your help.
Hang on. Chris has been asking about you.
What did he want to know?
What your secret is.
I wish I could tell him.
Can we forget about dolphin boy and focus?
Zac, we think we have found a weapon that could slay the dragon.
For real?
No, I just said it 'cause it sounds good.
The problem is, it's... It's a little tricky to get hold of.
What she means is... it's in a locked case in a secure room that's guarded 24/7.
So, if you don't want to help, that's okay...
Are you kidding? You had me at dragon slayer.
So far so good.
 What now?
Let me.
Where is it?
Looking for this?
: Hand it over.
And why would I do that?
Oh, that's right, so that you can destroy a dragon.
What kind of fantasy world do you live in?
We're telling you the truth. We need it.
This isn't some trinket that I plucked off a sandy seabed.
I was a thousand meters down, in the dark and the cold.
We know what that's like.
So maybe you can understand that this is what I do for a living, and I'm not about to give up the bracelet based on some fairy tale.
You can save your breath for the police.
You're bluffing.
Maybe I pressed it, maybe I didn't. Why don't you hang around and find out?
We're mermaids and so are you.
You can't turn your back on us!
As far as I'm concerned, you're just thieves.
I have a trick or two myself.
This... is a moon ring.
Think of your powers magnified a thousand times.
My advice? Do as we say.
: I'm not giving you the bracelet.
: If we don't stop the dragon, we'll all lose our powers, and then it will come for you!
What part of "no" don't you understand?
We don't want to hurt you, but we need your help.
 They're here.
: We need to go.
: But the bracelet!
We'll never get it if we get arrested.
: Quick, hurry up!
: All right, all right.
Open it. Quickly!
Let me!
 It's hot!
Did you get it?
It was tougher than we thought.
Ms. Chadwick, are you all right? The alarm went off.
Yes, yes. Everything's fine.
Good. Thank you.
Thank you.
Check downstairs.
She leaves town tomorrow.
Bye-bye, bracelet.
The full moon's tomorrow.
Thanks for reminding me.
: Are you sure the bracelet would have worked?
It was better than what we've got now, which is nothing.
So, what now?
We just stay out of the ocean and never go back?
No way am I going to hide from some dragon for the rest of my life.
Me neither.
 
: Mimmi.
I'm sorry about today.
Will you tell me what's going on?
Nothing.
Come on, Mimmi. I'm not stupid.
First you run out on me at the book signing, then the next time I see you you're being thrown out.
What's the story?
You can tell me. I won't judge you.
If there is anything you needed to know, I'd tell you.
So there is something.
It's complicated.
You just don't trust me enough.
It's not that.
Then what?
You know what? This isn't working.
Chris, please.
I can't be with someone who won't tell me the truth.
I'm sorry, Mimmi.
: Everything's accounted for, Ms. Chadwick.
Must be a false alarm.
Yes. Thank you.
