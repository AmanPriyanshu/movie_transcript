Not just about what you feel, but about what you want."

Ohh.

Nothing. I just wanted to apologize.
For waking me up?
That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
No. For being wrong.
What the hell is going on here?
I was wrong.
Listening to Karen talk about passion and honesty tonight, I realized that I wasn't mad at you, I was jealous of you.
What? Why?
Because you have something you're passionate about, and I don't know what I have.
I used to be an artist, and then I had a kid and put it on hold.
And then I had the store, and that became my life.
Now Lucy's getting older, and I'm just a crazy woman checking her daughter's Instagram account every five minutes.
[Chuckles] I just feel a little...
Lost?
Disoriented?
Confused?
All of the above.
Well, you still have the store.
Yeah, I guess.
But I think I'm gonna give more responsibility to Randy.
Really? To Randy?
Why?
So I can step away.
There's this painting fellowship I read about.
And if I'm gonna figure out a way to do it, I'm gonna have to let go of the store a little bit.
It will be good practice for when Lucy goes.
[Cellphone chimes]
[Sighs] Oh.
Yeah, you could definitely use a little practice with letting go.
The point is... as confused as everything may be, living with you is not something I'm confused about.
