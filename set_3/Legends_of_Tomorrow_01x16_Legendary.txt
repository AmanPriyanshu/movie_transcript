I've assembled you all because I need your help.
You've turned your back on the very institution you were meant to serve.

The Oculus not only gives us a window into time, but the ability to shape it.
 then we need to destroy it.
Shut it down!
There are no strings on me.
[explosion]
He traded his life for ours. He was a hero.
Savage still has Carter and Kendra.
This is a timeship.
A little gift from our friends.
I no longer need to rule the world.
I now have the ability to change it.
[electronic booming]
[engine winding down]
What are we doing back here?
Savage has a timeship, courtesy of the Time Masters.
The timeline is unclear, due to our destruction of the Oculus, meaning Savage is lost to history.
Which is why I brought you all home.
Mission's not over, man.
Jax is right.
We've lost Savage before. We'll find him again.
And then what? We have no way of killing Savage, particularly now that Kendra and Carter are in his possession, assuming that they're still alive, which is highly unlikely.
So that's it?
We're... we're just giving up?
I'm on my way to the refuge to retrieve our younger selves and return them to the timeline.
It will be as if you never left.
What, you think that we can just return to our old lives, and then pretend like none of this ever happened?
Mm, that might be a tad difficult.
So I had to bring you back to May 2016, not January 2016.
Great, so what you're saying is for the last five months, my mom probably thinks that I'm dead.
Thanks a lot, man.
Okay, wait, why?
Why the change of plans, Rip?
If you're getting back on that ship, we get back on that ship.

Hey.
Hi, Daddy.
Baby.

I just got back.
I tried calling, but nobody was answering.
I was at Laurel's, but she wasn't there.
Where is everyone?
[deep breath] This, uh, Damien Darhk, he's causing problems.
Well, good to know nothing's changed in five months.
Dad?
What's wrong?

No, baby.
You're starting to scare me.
Damien Darhk was in prison, and he escaped, and everyone tried to... stop him.

What do you want, haircut?
To apologize, sort of.
For Snart.
I was the one who was supposed to die, and I can't help feeling that...
It wasn't your fault.
It was his.
Son of a bitch never did anything without a plan.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe he wanted this.
What are you doing with your hand?
Maybe he wanted us to, you know, be partners.
Think I'm going to be sick.
I think Snart knew.
He knew that I'd keep an eye out for you, and you'd keep an eye out for me.
While doing what?
What we haven't finished doing.
What was H.G. Wells' childhood nickname?
Bertie.
[sighs] Incredible.
You've gotten every answer correct tonight.
Since when did you become such a history buff?
I guess I developed a passion for it recently.
During your sabbatical?
You hardly ever talk about it.
Martin?
I know, I'm sorry.
My sabbatical was, um...
I left some very important work unfinished.

We saw it take off, remember?
Yes, and in doing so, it would have left...
Quantum signature.
That's what I've been trying to tell Mick.
Radio beacon.
Quantum entangler.
Boring.
When do we get in contact with Hunter?
Ms. Lance, are you all right?
How do we get the Waverider back here?
Hi, Daddy, we miss you.
And love you.
And love you.
Tell me you've located Savage.
I don't understand. This should have worked.
Did you account for subspace interference?
It's the first thing I thought of.
Did you adjust for temporal polarity?
Oh, Raymond, you insult me.
Can you reach the Waverider or not?
: We're working on it.
Actually, guys, I think it just worked.
[engine roaring]
I thought I made my intentions perfectly clear.
And we wish to be equally clear about ours.
Do you mind?
Just checking to see if you're real this time.
You're not ditching us again.
When the mission's over, then we can all go our separate ways.
And this mission is not over.
Yeah, just curious how much headway you've had tracking Savage without all of us.
None.
But neither have I got myself into bar fights in 1975 and the Old West, put dwarf star technology into the hands of terrorists, or got myself turned into a scary bird monster.

You dropped us off five months later because you knew.
Knew what?
You knew that Laurel was going to die, and now you're going to take me back, and I'm going to save my sister.

You should be afraid.

Mr. Rory, take Ms. Lance to sleep it off.
Not to dismiss what just happened, but we do have to find Savage, assuming that Kendra and Carter are still on his timeship.
He could...
Be anywhere in time and space.
Oh, well that narrows it down a lot.

No, it lives over...

Nah, man.

Well, his mind isn't fully gone.
Hey! Stay away from him!
I'm going to kill you.
You've had 4,000 years to do so, with no success.
What are you doing?
Your blood is the key to unlocking the Thanagarian technology.
Thanagarian?
The alien species which gave the three of us our powers.
When they are activated by your blood,
I will be able to erase time itself, and travel us back to 1700 B.C.
No. No!

So this is a spaceship?
It's a timeship, but yes, it does also travel through space.
You... you've seen it before, Mr. Hall.
That used to be my name. Carter Hall.
There really is rather a lot to fill you in on, and we really do not have the time.
What about...
Kendra, yes, we need your assistance in locating her and Savage.
Perhaps we can start with what Savage was doing in 1944.
He said something about, um... Thanagarian technology.
Thanagarian...
The Thanagarians were race of extraterrestrials.
He also said that this technology was actually three meteors.
Thank you, Gideon.
I've seen that rock before.
Savage had one of those in 1958.
He took our blood. He said he would use it in a ritual to erase time, take the blood back to 1700 B.C.
What are you doing?
Come on, man.
We got to try it again.
That thing that we did in World War II.
It's called transmutation.
Yeah.
It's a similar process by which our uniform materializes when we merge, but at the moment, we need to focus on figuring out what Savage is planning.
Come on, just the once.
Is that Raymond and Kendra's lucky vase?
I don't know, I just found this junk lying around.
Oh, come on. Don't you think that turning something into something else might come in handy?
[sighs] All right, one time only.
Okay, just the once.
All right. [exhales]
You need to focus, Jefferson.
Why do you always say it like I'm not focusing?
Ah, before we had a Nazi trying to kill us.
This is just a vase.
[explosion]
[huffs, sighs]
Come on. [sighs]
[both sigh]
I never thought I'd utter these words, but I think we need a Nazi.
Not funny.
Look, the reason I keep telling you to focus is because transmutation is a literal function of mind over matter.
Dude, this sucks. Why do I always got to be in the driver's seat?
Oh, don't despair, Jefferson.
This is only our second attempt at transmutation, and, you know, they always say, "The third time's a charm."
What?
Third time. Three rituals.
I-I think I know what Savage is planning to do.
[laughs softly]
I figured out how Savage plans to erase time.
I believe he intends to detonate each of these meteors in a different time period.
How can you destroy the world three times in three different times?
You can't, it would create a temporal paradox.
Which would result in a timequake that would return the Earth to the point of the first chronothermic reaction, Ancient Egypt.
Okay, it's official.
This is the craziest bad guy plan in the history of bad guy plans.
I don't think that sanity is a yardstick by which Vandal Savage can be measured.
Okay, so which time periods are we talking here?
You said Savage was in possession of one of these meteorites in 1958.
That was a year of a rare alignment, with the Earth and Thanagar.
Evidently he got hold of a second meteorite in 1944.
Which would be useless to him in a year where Earth and Thanagar weren't in alignment.
Now, if my math is correct, and trust me, it is, the next two years that Earth and Thanagar are in sync are 1975 and 2021.
But Savage still has to do this in three different time periods.
That's the beauty of immortality, Jefferson: he can.
[dark music]
[engine stops]
Can't be.
Can.
Thanks to time travel, and it's because of time travel that I know you're here.
You're out here tonight, because you have felt an immanent presence of... something.
A... a meteorite?
And I'm going to give you a use for it which will give us the power to rewrite destiny itself.
Change the course of the entire world.
So if Savage plans on blowing up the world three times, how do we stop him?
We don't.
We kill him.
How?
We've always known that only you or Kendra could kill Savage using items exposed, as you were, to the meteor's radiation.
Now, the radiation works both ways.
It gave Savage his immortality, but...
It also makes him vulnerable.
And Savage is about to unleash the radiation from three meteorites in three different time periods.
Triple the exposure.
Yes.
Which should be sufficient to render Savage mortal.
And then all we got to do is kill Savage three times.
Indeed. Gideon can navigate the Waverider, and we can split into teams of two.
One in 1958, one in 1975, and one in 2021.
Open it.
Did you know that this is one of the original meteorites which fell upon the Middle Kingdom?
Drawn from the ground after a millennia, straight into Nazi hands.
The object that has bound the two of us together for 4,000 years has the power to take us back to where it all began.
But this time, I will be the pharaoh, and you...
Will hate you, like I've always hated you.
[laughs]
Patience, Mr. Hall.
I think that's a comet or something.
It's a meteorite, in point of fact.
I was drawn to it as well.
When can I kill him?
We have to wait for the meteor to go critical.
When's that?
When he starts the ritual in all three time periods.

Um, we got a nuclear bomb, here.
Professor, Jax, we need you.
