 Reign...
(Bash gasps)
You have magic in you.
Trust no one.
Especially not the likes of Martel De Guise.
If I'd have known you were a Guise, I would have never let you take me to bed that night.
Should we halt our military advances in Scotland?
I don't think that's wise.
But Mary's alive.
We don't know that for sure.
Several Scottish lords have already agreed to back me as their ruler.
We received word from Edinburgh.
What does Mary ask of you?
To kill Queen Elizabeth.
: This is your fault.
Following after Charles on some misguided plot to take down the Red Knights, and lose the king of France.
You were right about the Red Knights.
We have to escape.
: Your lordships. John Knox.
Don't pretend you care that my sister is dead.
James, you and I and the other lords can rule Scotland together as a Protestant government.
Call a meeting tomorrow and dissolve the throne.
: Mary, you're alive.
I am Mary, Queen of Scots, and I have come for my throne.
My own land.
Scotland is a feudal place in many ways.
People look to their regional nobles for leadership more than their monarch or regent.
And the nobles, they bow to a select few who have risen to prominence.
Your Protestant friends, the Lords of the Congregation.
: What do you make of this threat from England?
I trust the intelligence we've received, that Elizabeth means to unite the two countries.
She means to take mine.
And where do the nobles stand?
: None will speak openly.
But, as many follow John Knox, I would listen carefully to what he preaches.
He states he would rather be ruled by a Protestant from afar than a Catholic at home.
A Protestant woman, no less.
Yes, it's saying something that he would support her, given his hatred of all women.
What is his issue?
They disgust him.
Now, I've never met his mother, but my guess is, it starts there.
(Scoffs)
Mary, he's a master orator and people listen to him.
You-you can't attack him directly or arrest him without seeming to crush the Protestant faith.
You would, however, beat Elizabeth at her own game and appease Knox if you do as he's asked.
Convert to the religion of the land.
He didn't ask, he demanded and then ordered me to step down from my throne if I didn't obey.
Where are you going?
To show John Knox that queens do not bow to their subjects.
It is, in fact, quite the other way around.
(Horses neighing)
: Stand up for Her Majesty!
Did they come willingly?
Of course.
They were told it was at the queen regent's invitation.
Welcome.
Two nights ago, I dined on onion soup and the broth was sweet, having none of the bite common to that vegetable.
When I learned that the morsels were grown in your town of Vouvant, I wanted to thank you personally.
What's the real meaning of this?
I interrogated the captured Red Knight and he refuses to speak.
If I'm to glean any information on Charles' whereabouts, I'm going to have to change my strategy.
You will take over the questioning.
And if he still won't talk?
The prisoner knows these individuals, and if he still refuses to answer your questions, he can watch while the torturer chops off their fingers.
Francis was a good king.
He and his nation, followers of the true faith.
And I'm glad to see you are as well.
I am in mourning in God's house only.
Otherwise I am moving forward with my life.
And I would like to take Scotland into the future as well.
Bishop Hamilton.
Could you not do this in private?
In your own chambers...
Reverend Knox.
Your Majesty.
If your intention is to take Mass, I must remind you that it is forbidden by the Lords of the Congregation.
But I am your queen.
I have returned and I will practice my faith.
But you can tell the nobles who alerted you to my activities this afternoon that I have no desire to impose my religion on anyone else or to impede the worship of theirs.
We can live together in peace.
Scots united.
Or do you not stand with us?
Do you stand with Elizabeth, who plans to absorb Scotland, to erase its very existence?
It will never happen.
: How can you be so dismissive?
Our intelligence has been vetted.
Elizabeth is planning some sort of aggression.
Women say such things in anger for effect.
For attention.
You, your faith, and the Vatican are the real threat to peace.
I have returned home to lead this country to greatness.
Help me bring all of my people together, or may God and your queen have mercy on your soul.
(Mouthing)
(Knocking on door)
(Sighs)
Your son is fine.
Sleeping like a lamb.
(Sighs)
I'm more worried about you.
I have read this letter over and over, praying I'm misinterpreting Mary's code.
Asking you to slay her rival.
Elizabeth plans to take Scotland, and once she does, she cannot allow Mary to survive.
But, Lady Lola, you are a mother, a wife, not an assassin.
In two days there is a summit of Elizabeth's advisors.
The event will allow Mary's agent to blend in and then strike.
All the assassin needs is someone on the inside, someone that Elizabeth can trust.
If you're caught...
Mary has sent coin enough to plan my escape, but I won't risk John's life.
Arrange another meeting with my husband.
My queen, my friend needs me.
Elizabeth must die.
: I know you were planning on holding court, but I wouldn't just yet.
What is it? What's happened?
There was a slaughter of Protestants in a small village near St. Andrews.
Houses burned, mothers and fathers gutted in front of their children.
The few Catholics who were left fled.
We must find them.
They're probably halfway to Ireland by now.
They did round up the village priest who seems to have incited the violence.
: Mary.
I was meeting with your military leaders when news came in that a group of Englishmen have been sighted traveling from town to town.
A delegation of noblemen sent by Elizabeth.
They seem to be meeting with various lords who hold sway in their regions, particularly Protestants.
She's trying to turn them.
Seeing who's willing to ally themselves with her against me.
: The timing of this could not be worse.
Coming on the heels of the Catholic slaughter of Protestants.
Bring me this Catholic priest.
If he is guilty, he will hang.
Now you and I are going to go and meet these English nobles and tell them that Scotland is not for sale.
I will assemble a team of queensguard to accompany us.
: I thought I recognized you.
You were among the Druids attacked by Clan Macfie.
Your wounds were grave, and yet, your neck, there's not a mark on you.
I remember you, too.
Touched by magic you are.
You don't belong here.
You can't protect her.
Mary, you mean.
You're not doing all that you can do.
All that you're capable of.
Bash?
I'm sorry. A moment.
(Indistinct conversations)
Lord Dudley.
Thank you for making the journey.
I think I speak for the entire council when I say the potential acquisition of Scotland is an exciting prospect.
But I need to speak with you in private.
Not now... my attentions are needed here.
Get word to our spies in Scottish court that our delegation is heading to Edinburgh.
: Is that all you brought?
(Baby cooing)
Stephan, I can't go with you.
What?
(Baby John fusses)
You said we would get on Gideon's boat and we would never look back.
So what's changed?
There's an event Elizabeth wants me here for.
An event?
Some sort of reception for her advisors.
We had a plan.
And now Elizabeth is back at court, she'll be watching your every move.
To leave, you need money, coin to bribe them...
It's been taken care of.
Go. Take John with you.
There's an inn in London...
The Anchor... I'll meet you both there in two days.
Wha... two days?
Why can't you leave now?
(Sighs) This marriage... it's been a challenge like no other.
I feel like I was a child before I knew you.
I was able to judge you and the things you did because I never understood the darkest truths of this world.
I don't want you to dwell in darkness.
I want to protect you from it.
I know.
And I love you.
Oh, please go, while I still have the courage to say good-bye.
What do you mean “good-bye”?
(Baby John coos)
For now.
I'm your wife again, Stephan.
We're a family.
: Mama.
Please take care of him.
(Indistinct conversation)
My private soldiers visited each of the nobles who are providing safe haven to the royal children.
Here are their reports.
Good afternoon, Princess.
Tell me first, how is Henry?
He's quite homesick in Orleans.
Well, he may get his wish to return soon enough, oblivious to the fact that he may already be king.
If Charles is...
Queen Regent, rumors are afoot that the Red Knights are mounting an assault on the castle.
We are to escort you and the princess to your chambers until the privy council can gather.
Put your men on notice, I may need their services.
(Man groans, people shouting)
(Groans)
No! Wait, Martel, he's one of us!
: What is happening?
Your interrogation methods paid off.
Our prisoner gave up the names of the last Red Knights to infiltrate the kingsguard.
Here they are.
They were going to kill us.
You saved our lives.
Leith Bayard.
It's a good thing you moved when you did.
Duke Martel De Guise.
Yes, you're quite a hero.
Is there word of the king?
I believe the captive genuinely didn't know where King Charles was being hidden.
Is Charles already slain?
O-Or he escaped and the Red Knights are scrambling.
: Well, that is a hope I shall cling to.
Leith, protect my daughter.
Cling to each other.
May you have a long and happy life.
I give you my blessing to wed.
I love you.
God, I love you.
Bash, you've been quiet this journey.
Is something troubling you?
You needn't worry about me.
But I do.
It was my choice to come here to serve you, to protect you, and I will.
You're not responsible for me or my happiness.
So, my maids' gossip is true.
And I thought Melaniee came along because she could cook.
She did.
And she can tell a great joke as well.
(Indistinct conversations)
(Animal bleating)
That's them.
The English, plain as day.
You there.
I am Mary, Queen of Scots.
I want to talk to the leader of your delegation.
Gideon.
Your Majesty.
We can't do this.
You're right.
Our hosts or their servants could come in at any moment.
No, I mean that we can't do this if we are enemies.
Are we, Gideon?
I am here in service of my queen.
Can you share anything with me?
They say your delegation is making progress with my nation's Protestants.
Which ones and how powerful are they?
Mary, it's worse than that.
We've also made headway with Catholic nobles.
Elizabeth is proposing a bloodless coup after so much blood has been spilt.
You can understand that the known is, is more appealing than the unknown.
Your people are so tired of foreigners, of fighting.
Fighting and unrest incited by England for centuries.
And now I'm the potential tyrant?
I'm the one to fear?
Gideon, I need time.
It will take years for your people to trust you.
Days.
Something has happened and I need to fix it to show my Protestant nobles that I am Scotland's queen and not a Catholic despot.
You are moving north towards my most powerful lords.
The Lords of the Congregation, if they turn to Elizabeth...
Then I am finished.
If you truly care for me, you will delay your travels.
I'm not here alone.
My choices will be noted.
One day.
Just stall.
Somehow, please.
All right.
I'll do it.
(Bell tolling in distance)
(Trumpet blows)
Oh, my son.
You have returned to me.
Oh, the king is alive! Long live the king!
: Long live the king!
And Thierry is dead.
I can't, I can't do it.
I don't want it.
You don't want what?
To be king.
God save Mary, Queen of Scots.
God save her.
And you are?
Better you don't know.
There's a mechanical clock in the corridor leading to the Great Hall.
Hide the pistol inside and I'll retrieve it when the time is right.
The pistol requires close range to be effective.
I'll need you to stall Elizabeth as she makes her way to the library.
You'll get your shot.
But how do you have any hope of escaping with your life?
I don't.
I shall die in the service of Queen Mary and the true faith.
Until tomorrow.
Information has come from our spies that the Red Knights are hiding in one of three potential towns.
What does that have to do with you?
I have been assigned the mountain village of La Clusaz, where I will question the locals and help track down the last of these betrayers.
You can stop trying to prove yourself to my family.
Charles is out of danger and my mother has given us her blessing.
But none of that matters unless I can keep the Valois safe.
Most importantly, you.
♪ What if we run away, what if we left today? ♪
If you go on this mission, I'll stop loving you.
You can do that? Just like that?
Yes. Ask anyone.
I'm as fickle as they come.
I suppose that does change things.
Before, I had reason to return home quickly and all in one piece.
For our wedding.
Your mother may have given her blessing, but I still must do the asking.

(Door creaking open)
(Chains rattling)
Father Ashby, you have been brought before us because you have been accused of inciting a massacre.
I know what happened, and I have spoken against Protestants, but I have urged Catholics to use the same tactics Protestants have adopted of late, protest.
Then why are you still blamed?
Because I'm the only one left standing.
It's a small village.
The Catholics who lived there fled.
The Catholics who murdered their neighbors?
I don't even know if locals from my parish did it, because I wasn't there.
I'd taken a retreat, seeking silence and prayer.
Please tell me that this retreat was at a monastery where people saw you.
Well, I wanted to be with nature.
I took shelter in an abandoned abbey near Loch Leven.
They say you are clever, skilled by Catherine De Medici in the ways of the French.
And what ways are those?
Politically expedient.
Mercenary.
You cannot blame me for something I didn't do.
God knows the truth, and if you trade my life for your gain, it will forever mark your soul.
Take him back to the dungeon.
(Door creaks shut)
I can't win.
Protestants hate me because I am Catholic, and everyone else mistrusts me because I am French.
What a fearful, angry man.
But there is no proof that he is to blame.
Mary, you rushed back to court, ahead of the English contingent, to win over your Protestant lords.
If you don't give them justice for their dead, they will turn to Elizabeth.
How is murdering him justice?
I can't do it, James.
I can't.
(Sighs)
(Indistinct conversations)
: Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth.
Your Majesty.
As your Scottish advisor, I-I was hoping to sit in.
The summit is for official advisors.
It would be best if our arrangement stayed between us.
Elizabeth?
Lola, is something wrong?
: Elizabeth! Look out!
(Woman screaming)
Seize the assassin.
Seize Lady Lola as well.
They were working in concert, I'm sure.
(Elizabeth and Lola panting)
Arrest her.
It seems my would-be assassin is a Catholic radical.
He confessed the two of you worked together to plan the details of my murder.
And it was all by the order of Mary, Queen of Scots.
Was that the plan all along?
Oh, no.
You are at war with my country.
I'm not!
I explained that to you and I meant every word.
This idea of yours, a bloodless offensive, it is a delusion you have talked yourself into when once you knew there can only be one queen.
And I had to choose mine.
I welcomed you into my court.
I confided in you.
I trusted you.
Oh, you don't trust anyone.
You have more power than anyone around you, and people will want it.
And because you value power above all else, you will always be alone.
It's incredible, really.
I march to my execution very soon, and yet you are the one to be pitied.
(Sighs)
I told the privy council that you outmaneuvered the Red Knights and they loved every word of it.
You're a hero, Charles.
Never has a king been in such favor.
What do you want from me, Mother?
(Sighs)
You survived.
You are fine.
Am I?
(exhales sharply)
Thierry and I were separated.
(Men shouting)
Thierry, no.
The Red Knights caught him.
(Grunts)
:
(Indistinct shouting echoing)
He could see, hear, and smell his flesh burn.
He screamed for hours but never gave me up.
He sacrificed himself so you could live.
He knew the value of a king's life.
I told you, I don't want to be king.
This isn't a job you get to choose, and you can't just walk away from it.
Where are you going?
To tell the council my decision.
You have a responsibility to this nation and to your family.
No, I don't. I can't do it.
I feel nothing, I am nothing!
You never say such things.
You foolish boy, you need to grow up.
I didn't work this hard for nothing.
(Breathing shakily): Charles, look at me.
You show your enemies such weakness, and they will keep coming.
And this nightmare will never end.
(Door shuts)
Father Ashby is dead? How?
Hanged himself in the night.
A mortal sin, perhaps his second.
He could have been lying to you, Mary, about his role in the Protestant massacre.
No.
I think the poor man killed himself because he thought I would torture him until I got the answer I wanted.
Being trained as I am by Catherine De Medici.
Maybe he was right after all.
As much as it sickens me to do this... whether he was a liar or a victim, his death will not be in vain.
: This is Father Simon Xavier Ashby.
You may see a Catholic priest, but I see a man guilty of committing atrocities against his countrymen, sentenced to hang by his queen.
I have invited you here so that you may know that under my rule, all men will be judged not by their faith but by their actions.
Because, regardless of my faith, I am not a Catholic queen, I am not a Protestant queen, I am not a French queen, I am
 queen.
(All murmuring)
I was born on this soil.
Crowned after the English murdered my father when I was six days old.
I was raised to fight for this nation.
I am Scottish.
(All murmuring in agreement)
This country is in my blood as I know it is in yours.
I believe in a Scotland that is independent, prosperous, and peaceful.
A Scotland that cannot be frightened, bullied, or bought by anyone.
If you agree, then you will stand with me and tell this English delegation, who would urge you to bow to their queen, what we have told countless invaders before them... (All murmuring in agreement) that this is
 land.
And that, though they may spill our blood, they will never take the Scotland that pounds in our veins!
(Cheering and applause)
: Long live the queen!
(People shouting indistinctly)
: Lord Beljour? Count DuFrey?
Your Grace.
Your Majesty.
Was there an unannounced meeting?
Mother, come in.
I'm glad to see you back on your feet, recovered.
Why is the privy council meeting without me?
It's what you wanted, me to be king, And thanks to your verbal embellishments, I'm not only king but a hero.
I asked them to declare me of age.
No.
My request was granted.
Charles, you've made a terrible mistake.
Which means I no longer need you as regent.
You can't use your children as pawns in your schemes to gain power.
You have no power 'cause I've taken it all away.
You said yourself you are not well.
The throne is a dangerous place.
You need experienced guidance.
But not yours.
Do you know...
Now leave.
Not another word, do you hear me?
Summon my military advisors.
Lady Lola's husband's arrived at court.
He's insisting that she's innocent, demands a chance to plea for her release.
He is the chancellor of France.
This can't turn into an international incident.
Summon the executioner.
Lady Lola will lose her head today.
Tell Chancellor Narcisse I will extend a diplomatic courtesy to France by permitting him to attend his wife's execution.
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.
I know that you've grown very fond of her.
I let her get close because I was lonely.
Lady Lola said I would always be alone, but I don't want to be.
Elizabeth...
It has been months since your wife's death, and since the assassination attempt on my life, the nation's sympathies will be with me.
Marry me.
Elizabeth, we can't.
This time I won't delay, I won't pull away.
I don't care if it diminishes me on the world stage, I want to share my power with you.
More than share... you will be England's king, instantly risen in station above me.
Do you hear yourself, Elizabeth?
This isn't talk of love.
It is.
What is love if not sacrifice?
Stop, just stop.
I can't marry you because I'm already wed to another.
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't give me any time.
How could you?
Because you promised me that it would be years before we had any possibility, and I've lost faith.
Who is she?
Lettice Knollys.
(Sighs)
It's an advantageous match.
(Grunts)
Get out.
Elizabeth...
You are dismissed, Robert.
Leave me and my court.
(Door opens)
(Panting)
(Door shuts)
One of my kingsguard has confirmed that the Red Knights are holed up in a farm on the outskirts of La Clusaz.
Then you must move quickly.
If you can trust your source.
Leith Bayard has served my family loyally for years, Martel.
Now, he recommends an attack as soon as possible to prevent the Knights from fleeing to Switzerland.
But I need extra forces for the siege.
: Count on my help, Majesty.
My soldiers are expert on missions like this.
Will your source, this Leith, be waiting at La Clusaz?
He will.
France thanks you for your advice and assistance.
Your Majesty.

: Word has spread of your fairness.
The justice you delivered, even to those who do not share your faith.
Requests are pouring in from burgs all around, begging for a visit from the queen.
What's wrong?
There was an assassination attempt on Elizabeth.
Is she all right?
She is, but, Mary, Lola was said to be involved.
No.
She was beheaded.
I'm so sorry.
I don't understand.
Lola would never.
There-there must be some kind of mistake.
Her punishment was carried out very quickly.
Or is this whole thing some lie that Elizabeth manufactured because she lost her bid for Scotland?
And did she kill my friend to punish me?
Where was Narcisse?
He tried to intercede.
He's in prison.
And our spies confirmed there was an assassination attempt.
Lola would never... be involved with something like this.
Who would implicate her?
Who?
It was you, wasn't it?
That's why you ignored the threat that Elizabeth posed, because you hoped she'd be dead soon, assassinated.
You don't think, based on one small bit of logic, that I would confess to trying to kill a queen?
I also know that you set up a presence near Elizabeth's court.
My sister, who is heartbroken, admitted that she and Lola traded information using coded letters.
Did you have Lady Lola watched?
Your spy reading her letters, learning their code, forging a letter from Mary.
Your comprehension of espionage is impressive.
You used Lola so that Mary would be tied to the attempt.
So that even if it failed, it would become personal between Mary and Elizabeth.
(Sighs)
They're like two spiders in a jar.
They can't coexist, they can't let the other survive.
Still, sometimes someone needs to give the jar a good shake.
I could tell Mary what you've done.
With what proof?
Only your speculation, which, yes, she might believe, causing her to come after me.
Is that what you want her doing?
Attacking the religious leader of the country when she has sworn tolerance?
Who's shaking the jar then?
If you care about your sister, you won't give her reason to misstep.
And if I care about my sister, what do I do about you?
Play all sides as you have always done, but be sure to stay on mine, because Mary's rule will not last.
Scotland could be the first true democracy since the Greeks, and you could be its first leader.
Sorry I'm late.
I had to deliver some terrible news.
Melaniee.
Who are you really?
For a moment, I was Melaniee, wasn't I?
People see what they want to see.
Catholics, Protestants, they see evil in each other when fear is the real evil.
But you were raised in an older faith, weren't you?
How do you know that?
Pagan, Druid... both respect this earth and its powers.
We can teach them to you.
You'll need them, if you want to help Mary.
But first you have to admit you have seen things that others have not.
You have to believe.
Do you, Sebastian?
(Bell tolls)
Charles!
My dearest son, you can't hug your big brother whenever you'd like; he's king at the moment.
Give us a minute, darling.
(Sighs)
What is he doing here, Mother?
Well, I brought him back to keep him safe.
And to serve as a reminder to you and to everyone, really, just how many sons I have and how replaceable you are.
Are you threatening me?
I don't have to, because the monarchy is a system that works.
Someone must rule, and if you, the king, should suddenly die, your little brothers come with a very wise and seasoned regent at their side.
Your talk of family.
You said it mattered more than anything.
You taught me otherwise.
Come.
You say that I'm in danger, and yet you're leaving me.
I don't understand.
I'm not sure I do either, but if you were harmed and I could have saved you...
Save me how?
By joining a band of Druids?
Bash, you've seen how they live, hand to mouth, how they are persecuted.
I've seen other things, too.
Mary, I've seen the dead.
I've seen them walk the halls of the castle.
A girl during the plague.
Others, too, in the shadows.
Well, that was just exhaustion and...
And what?
It wasn't grief.
I've seen souls I barely knew.
Have you seen others?
Francis?
No.
But these people, they can teach me.
They say that what I am is a “seer.”
That, in time, I can help you.
By talking to the dead?
By looking into the future.
Did you ever speak with Nostradamus about his gift?
It evolved, it took time.
I have to go.
Not just for you but for myself.
But I will come to you when you need me the most.
Of this I am sure.
: I got your message.
Your scout was very discreet, but should you be here so close to the border?
I had to see you before you returned home.
(Exhales)
I'm glad.
But there is something I need to ask of you.
Get close to Elizabeth the way she asked you to get close to me.
The way you have gotten close to me.
Mary, no.
Bring me her secrets.
You are angry because of Lola.
Lola died because she got caught between Elizabeth and me.
Too many people I love have died trying to bring peace, trying to save me.
I need to end this before anyone else who has the misfortune of being in my life dies.
Do not kill Elizabeth.
There will be much retaliation.
I have no intention of killing her.
I will dismantle her power bit by bit.
Every choice I make, who I fight, who I support, who I am marrying, will be in service of taking her throne.
Her nation, England, someday it will be mine.
