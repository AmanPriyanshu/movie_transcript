Hey, Stan. "When the door became stuck while attempting to remove some files, Agent Gaad pulled repeatedly."
[beeping]
While it was being repaired, there was a death there.
We just got something new in from Fort Detrick.
It's the worst thing I've ever seen.
I was thinking about not telling the Centre about this.
Amador. Nina. My old boss got killed.
I think you guys might've done it.
There's been talk about blackmailing you.
I don't want you on my conscience, too.
This is the last time we're gonna see each other.
Got a cigarette?
No, we don't.
Don't be scared, sweetheart.
[grunting]
No!
Aah!
[man groaning]
: Let's go. Paige, now!
[groaning]
Oh, he's gonna get you. He's gonna get you!
[groans loudly]
Oh, ho!
[blows air]
Let me show you how it's done.
Yeah, do.
[exhales deeply]
Hey, guys.
We're fine. We're fine. We, um, we almost got mugged.
What?
We're okay.
Uh, there were just... We yelled, and the guys ran, and, um...
It was just scary.
I'm gonna... just go.
Uh, your mother and I are gonna... settle down your sister.
He was dead.
Was he dead?
I don't know. I... There were two guys.
One of them had a knife. And I had to. I...
She, like...
She just...
It's okay.
[exhales deeply]
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay. It's okay. [smooches] It's okay.
[whispers] It's okay.
Don't we have to call the police?
We have to call the police.
We can't do that, honey.
We can't draw any attention to ourselves.
Did you have to... do that?
Yeah, I did.
I feel sick.
It was...
[whispers] I know. It's okay.
♪
[knocks on door]
Are they okay?
Yeah.
What happened?
They were walking to the car, uh, from the food pantry downtown.
Couple guys came up to them, but they scared them away.
So, they didn't get mugged?
No, no, but it was really upsetting.
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
Good night, bud.
Good night.
[sighs]
I'm sorry, but I have to go out.
Now?
Just... just for a bit.
Where are you going?
[sighs] I have to meet with someone.
Is it work?
Yeah.
How did you know how to do that?
I was trained to defend myself.
Dad, too?
It was just so fast, and I didn't even know what was happening.
And... he was just...
I was so scared.
I know.
And you didn't even seem upset after.
You... you were, like, calm.
How could you be calm?
You... you killed him, Mom.
I wasn't gonna let him hurt you.
And then it was just all happening so fast.
I just...
Have you... done that before?
Have you?
To protect myself, yeah.
How many times?
I don't know.
Were you scared?
I'm sure you guys are frustrated with the rate of repair on the Los Angeles equipment.
Ah, I keep telling them...
That's not why I'm here.
I wanna ask you about your mother.
She died here, in the... in the office.
Yeah.
You found her when you came into work the next morning and called 9-1-1.
Yeah, she had a bad heart.
She worked alone at night?
Well, not really. I mean, she liked to come here at night.
She was 87. She lived alone.
This gave her a place to go, to... to feel useful.
But you weren't surprised then?
What do you mean? No, I wasn't surprised.
This was her place.
You know, she and my dad started the shop.
No autopsy was performed?
No.
And no follow-up investigation?
[scoffs] An investigation for what?
She'd been sick for a long time.
[sighs] Is there something I should know?
Oh. No, it's fine.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you.

Lassa fever is a very undignified way to go.
You basically dissolve inside, then squirt yourself out your anus... in liquid form.
First, it's whoosh. Then it's a trickle.
The modified strain you want... the strain Level Four is hard at work perfecting...
[sighs] It's even more lovely.
I can't do this one, Philip.
You're afraid.
Who wouldn't be?
But I-it's not that, I can do things I'm scared of.
I've been doing things I'm scared of for years.
But this... is one of the deadliest pathogens on the planet.
Just... say it actually gets out there.
And I play a part in that?
What do you want me to tell Gabriel?
[sighs] Tell him the truth.
Are you sure?
[whispers] Yeah.

Hey.
[whispers] She asleep?
Finally.
No school tomorrow?
Yeah.
Are
 okay?
I don't know.
I just keep... replaying it over and over in my head.
You got her out of there.
[sighs]
You know, right before...
She was telling me about this conversation she had with Matthew.
Stan told him about Martha, that she was a spy, and that he had met with her father and that it was hard.
Paige is reporting this to me.
♪
They ought to tear this goddamn building down.
And fire everyone who works in it, including us.
We have to set up on the mail robot.
Whatever that thing is, someone's gonna switch it out.
Tech guys aren't sure how long it runs.
You know what?
I don't really give a sh1t who's switching it out.
We'll just do the usual... flip him, have him make his drop.
We pick up some idiot from the Soviet embassy with diplomatic immunity, and PNG them.
And nothing changes.
Welcome to the division, sir.
Maybe we could shoot him.
[knock on door]
Cocoa.
You sleep at all?
Not really.
[sighs]
It's... dangerous, what you and Dad do.
Sometimes. Yeah.
But when I asked you that, you said it wasn't.
We didn't want you to worry.
Did you know it'd be dangerous when you joined?
I wanted to serve my country.
You never answer my questions.
That
 my...
It's always, "I wanna make the world better or... or safer," but it's never what happened.
Never the whole truth.
I grew up in a city called Smolensk.
It was almost totally destroyed during the war.
World War II.
I was only 2 when it ended, but... growing up there, it was...
Everything around me was destroyed.
And the people who survived... had done without food and... freezing and fighting.
They all worked together and fought back somehow.
I guess I always wanted to be like that, no matter what.
To fight back.
Dangerous didn't matter.
By the time I left... they had rebuilt so much of it.
Can't imagine what it looks like now.
I wish I could take you there. I wish...
I could show you where I grew up.
[chuckles]
[sighs]
[sighs]
Mm-hmm.
[sighs]
[sighs]
: Did she know who she was working for?
She met a guy at a Roy Rogers in Franconia.
Hints he's part of the mob, that they're worried we're about to sting one of their gambling operations.
Offers her 500 bucks a week to change out the recorder.
Is she gonna make the drop?
Yeah.
Let's get set up. Still think we're wasting our time?
I talked to the Director.
He's talking to the State Department.
And it looks like we're going to be able to spread the pain a little higher up the ladder.
[line ringing]
: Hello?
I'm calling about your daughter.
Who is this?
Please let me speak.
I have to be brief.
She's fine. She's doing well.
She's being taken care of by people who respect her very much.
She'll always be taken care of.
And she wants you to know she loves you and thinks about you.
We'll be in touch again if we can.
[gasps] Wait.
Wait...
[hangs up receiver]
Mom, you don't have to sit with me if you hate it.
I'm okay.
No, no, no. I'm... just trying to understand.
It's not logical, it's emotional.
Okay.
: Please understand, Grant.
[door opens]
: Hey!
Hi, Henry.
Hi, Matthew.
Hey.
Are you okay? Uh, Henry said you were sick.
Yeah, I-I just had a stomachache. I'm better now.
I could be dead, and Mom wouldn't let me stay home.
: Do you guys want something to eat?
Yes, please.
Sure. Yeah.
Matthew, come play me.
You know you can hook the computer up to the TV, right?
You know how to do that?
Yeah, my cousin showed me.
Sweet. Let's do it.
Wait. What are you doing?
Don't worry, Mom.
Yeah, it's okay, Mrs. Jennings.
It's really easy to unhook when you wanna watch TV.
Hey, uh, you wanna help?
Sure.
: So, how many shifts you think we'll need to pull before they pick it up?
Well, they wouldn't want to leave it out there too long.
On the outside?
We're there all night.
Hey, I'm gonna head out for a couple hours.
[door opens, closes]
Have you seen the antenna switchbox?
I don't know what that is.
It's a small box that we plug TV cables into.
Try the garage?
You're totally making Henry's life right now.
[door closes] Henry's cool.
Your dad's been really great with him, too.
Yeah, he's good with young kids.
But not teenagers?
Well...
Do you ever worry... about his job being dangerous?
I guess. Uh, I don't know.
He was undercover when we were in St. Louis.
I think that was scary.
Uh, chasing spies, uh... it's not, like, car chases and stuff.
It's more like, uh...
There's a lot of figuring out, waiting.
He says being an FBI agent taught him patience.
[chuckles]
Okay, we need this cable.
[sighs] I went to Bauman Technical University.
It's like your MIT. And I can tell you, we have the best scientists in the world, but we don't have the money, and it's... it's not a good combination.
I'm getting worried, Stan. All those brains, what... what they're doing. [Sighs]
Without the right resources, they get their hands on things that they cannot always handle in the right way.
Don't... don't ask me questions.
This... This isn't like that.
Okay.
There are... things we're doing.
They're too dangerous. They need to...
I can't call Andropov and say "stop."
I know.
If your people know that certain things are happening, that treaties are being broken, maybe it all stops.
If you bring this to the right people...
I will.
I'm giving you something... one thing.
After this, we're done.
Okay.
Do you know anything about biological weapons?
Not really.
Your military makes them... or tests them. I-I don't know.
Someplace. I don't know where.
They send some of the work out somewhere else.
We have someone there.
At that place, or... or one of those places.
That's it.
I just saw Burov.
He gave me enough pieces to put something together... probably an agent in place, working on biological weapons.
Now I don't have much yet, but... I think it's big.
Anybody else know about this?
No.
Aderholt.
We have to let them pick up their dead drop.
Pull everyone off the drop site except for one car with a video camera.
What's going on?
Stan's got something big.
We can't shake up anything at the Rezidentura right now.
♪
Philip tells me you're having second thoughts.
I started this because I believed in something.
I was young, idealistic.
It gets hard after a while to keep that up.
And now... this...
[sighs]
How can I believe in this?
With all the damage it can cause?
Well, it is hard to believe in things that kill people.
And you haven't seen the people you're defending in too long.
I think you have to see them, William.
What the hell does that mean?
You've given almost your whole life to your country, to your people.
It's time. It's time for you to come home.
And they're waiting for you.
You'll be a hero.
You'll find a wife. You'll have a family.
I know you've lost your sense in why we do this, but I promise you... it matters.
You'll do this one last thing...
And when you go home, you and your loved ones and all of our people will be safer because of it.
Employee list for Foster Medical. Thanks.
The other two labs?
Still waiting.
Thank you.
All right, so, we'll just look through, see who they've got in the top-secret bio-weapons research division, right?
Or we just send the whole list out to the field offices, call it a night?
I wish they'd put their clearances on here.
It'd be someone with real access... scientists, researchers.
High-level admin staff.
Security guy, maybe.
Think we can eliminate the accountants?
Now we're getting somewhere.
Oh, yeah.
I didn't think you'd be able to change his mind.
Deep down, he loves his country more than anything.
And he wants to go home.
[chuckles]
It's that simple?
I didn't change his mind.
I reminded him who he is and gave him what he wants.
And if that wasn't who he was anymore?
I don't know.
I agreed with William, thought we just should keep the whole damn thing to ourselves.
I'm not sure who was right about this one.
You can always count on Elizabeth.
You're good for each other.
She's steadfast. You need that.
The Centre made a good match.
Mm.
I'm sorry, Philip.
I need to sit down.
Ah.
Whew.
I used to think I'd do better, serve the Centre better, if I kept to myself.
You work alone, there's no one there tearing away at you, weakening you.
But...
You go to sh1t anyway.
And you're still alone.
Thanks for the ride.
Really, it's no sweat.
When are you gonna get your license?
As soon as I learn how to parallel park.
I could teach you.
Yeah.
I can try.
Dad?
Is he still at work?
He hasn't been home in a few days.
Sorry.
I mean, he's the one that wanted me back here a few days a week.
I was fine staying with my mom.
You didn't miss him?
I did, but I don't care where I sleep.
I'm glad you're back.
Things have been weird at my house.
Weird how?
Just, uh, stupid parent stuff. They treat me like I'm 12.
Yeah.
Do you still have your band?
No. Uh, we... we weren't very good.
[chuckles] Yeah, you really weren't.
What happened to that girl?
What was her name? Uh, Celery?
Celery. Yes, uh, her whole family is named after produce.

Okay.
Okay.
I should... I should get home.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

[exhales]
Hi, honey.
How was school?
Okay. Matthew drove me home.
He told me his dad hasn't been home in two days.
I-is that important?
What's going on with you two?
Nothing. We're friends.
Oh, my God. I-I'm not dating him.
Well, you want to date him?
What? No. I... I mean, I don't know. I...
I like him, but...
Henry's really close to Mr. Beeman, and we have no idea what he's saying to him about us.
You don't have to worry about that.
Why not?
You have to be careful with Matthew, Paige.
With... everyone.
Paige, you can have friends. We want you to have friends.
You have to be careful who you open up to.
Yeah, I-I got that point.
I'm not opening up, I'm just talking to him.
You talk to Mr. Beeman all the time.
He's practically a member of the family.
Yeah, that... that's different.
How?
We don't need you to get close to Matthew for us.
I'm just...
You want to be Matthew's friend, be Matthew's friend, but don't do
 because of us.
You do not have to worry about that.
You wanted me to worry about Pastor Tim and Alice.
That is very different...
When I wanted nothing to do with them, you told me I had to stay close with them, [telephone ringing] no matter how shitty I felt about it.
That is different.
No, it isn't.
You always say we'll get through this, but you never say how. I...[sighs]
