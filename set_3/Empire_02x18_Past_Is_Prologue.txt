Something like that.
What do you think? It's hot, right?
Think it'll be great for your brother's wedding.
Yeah, I want you and V to sing it together.
It's dope, right?
It's beautiful, Veronica.
Thanks, Jamal.
Told you. (LAUGHS)
Y'all got to find somebody else to sing it with you though, 'cause I'm not gonna perform.
: No. Yes, you are, Jamal.
You just saying that 'cause you're tired right now.
Look, your father turned his gym into a rehab just for you.
No, what I actually did, I got the top physical therapist, the same dude that put Peyton Manning together after that big old neck injury of his.
He said he's gonna have you in tip-top shape in a couple weeks, son.
: See?
Look, we... we want you to sing at our wedding.
Yes, we would love that.
Look, Dre even got ordained so he can do the ceremony.
(LAUGHS)
: He gonna marry us, Mal.
So I want both of my brothers to be there.
Period.
Maybe we should leave him alone, let him get some rest.
Look, we can even postpone it if you're not feeling...
I ain't singing no more, all right?
I'm sorry, man. I'm just... I'm just tired.
(VOICE BREAKING): Ain't y'all tired?
The same damn cycle all the time.
Just death and incarceration.
We could change that cycle.
I ain't singing again until we do.
Come on, man. What are you talking about?
Don't you realize if it hadn't been for you, I might not even be here, man.
You ain't got to thank me for that, Dad.
No, no. I mean... I mean, you took a bullet for me, baby.
That's something I will never forget.
How's Freda?
(LAUGHS)
You mean the girl that tried to shoot me?
She's a victim in this. She is. She's a victim, too.
Just like him and me and him.
Jamal.
: Dwight, you and them kids is paying for the crimes of your daddy.
Dwight, Dwight, hide over here. Here.
Shh.
(GRUNTING)
What are you talking about, Grandma?
: Okay.
Jamal is grumpy because he's tired.
He ain't never been shot before.
(CHUCKLES)
So I'm gonna take him to his room.
You said our grandfather was a cop.
My daddy 
 a cop.
Okay.
It's time for you to take your nap.
Juanita's gonna bring you up a nice little brandy.
Come on.
Say good-bye to everybody.
Good-bye to everybody.
: You're lucky Thirsty caught you before you blabbed to all those reporters.
You keep squeezing my arm, and I'm gonna check your damn mouth with my foot.
(QUIETLY): Look, this is my house.
I'm the only one that talks to my children about my past.
Is that clear?
Tell them the truth.
Juanita!
I'm worried about him.
I mean, and it's not because he doesn't want to do physical therapy.
He seems off, Lucious.
Yeah.
Doctors said he should be walking, but, um... he don't want to do music.
Yeah, that's what concerns me.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Come in.
I got Ms. Calhoun for you.
Hey.
How's my grandbaby?
He's a little stressed out right now, to be honest.
Do you have a moment where I can speak with you privately?
(LAUGHS)
Cookie and me ain't got no secrets.
Girl, sit down.
I was picked up by a couple of federal agents the other day.
Tariq. I told your ass.
After they told me what they might have wanted from me, I absolutely demanded to be allowed to leave.
: Yeah, but now, of course, they're gonna try to subpoena her. Can't let that happen.
We're gonna get 24-hour security around you.
: Okay, what did they say?
What kind of questions did they ask you?
They were asking a lot.
I didn't answer any of them.
Girl, you remember something.
They said something about a guy named Shyne Johnson, Shyne?
Shyne Johnson?
I knew I heard your voice, you evil bitch!
(SCREAMS)
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
(ALL SHOUTING)
(SCREAMS) Oh, my God!
I got her. I got you. I got you.
Come on, come on.
Get off of me, Dre!
It's okay, let me see.
Oh, my God.
What in the hell is wrong with you?!
I know you pushed me, bitch!
What?!
: Get off of me! Ow!
Calm down.
Get off of me!
No, that's a wild accusation to make!
I passed out on the way down, and then I woke up and I saw your shoes.
The bottom of those red Louboutins you love so much.
Oh, my God, she's crazy!
: Wait, no, no, no.
Rhonda, a whole lot of women rock them shoes.
I got a pair.
: Rhonda...
You're on her side now?
I'm on nobody's side, but I'm saying I can't see her doing that.
Okay, wait a minute.
Hold up. So, Rhonda, you really think pearl-clutching debutante Anika pushed you down the steps?
I know you did it.
How could I do something like that to you, Rhonda?
Oh, shut up, bitch!
Tell 'em, Dre.
(SIGHS) Tell 'em.
Dre?
We're sorry.
Wow.
We are sorry, Pop.
Sorry?
I don't know what's going on here.
We didn't mean to come into your office...
We're sorry?
...like this, with this type of energy.
(LAUGHS)
We're very sorry.
You are pathetic!
Sorry about that.
Is she okay?
Yeah, it's okay.
Oh, my God, she is crazy!
I could never do something like that!
Okay, go clean her up. Calm her down.
I got you. I got you.
Before she lose the baby.
Hey, and stay with her till we get her some security.
I'm on it.
She won't be subpoenaed.
Now that I'm not carrying his grandchild, we are nothing to him again.
And he's gonna let her get away with it.
They don't believe it, Rhonda.
What?
They don't believe it.
And neither do I.
What?
What about your visions, huh?
It's part of my illness, baby.
You said so yourself.
Well, if God was telling you that somebody pushed me down the stairs, I might have to start actually believing in him.
Well, what do you want us to do?
What I did for you.
With Vernon.
I didn't hesitate.
It was self-defense, Rhonda.
Oh, God.
It was self-defense.
Come on.
You know, your brothers are both musicians, right?
They got that from Lucious.
But what you got, aside from his mother's illness, is his killer instinct.
: Mr. Andre?
(CLEARS THROAT)
Thank you, Juanita.
(SIGHS)
(SNIFFLES)
You don't mean that.
Oh, I do.
I definitely mean it.
So, when you become the man that I married, the man who's willing to do what needs to be done...
Mm.
...have him give me a call 'cause I really miss him.
(CHUCKLES): Okay.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, laugh all you want.
I told your ass Tariq was gonna be a problem.
Nah, he ain't the problem.
We got too many people in common.
Problem is...
What?
(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING, VOLUME GROWS LOUDER)
Ugh. (CLICKS TONGUE)
What is it, Lucious?
You know, after you got locked up, I had to put in work on a couple cats.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Drug dealers.
The three horsemen who wanted us dead.
I got it.
Yeah, well, there was a fourth horseman.
First three was to protect our family.
But that last one, that was a job.
(SIGHS)
Who were you working for, Lucious?
You know who I was working for.
You was the one that let them hear my music.
Tommy Davoni and Rosey Perkins?
Exactly.
They were cutting a record with this new artist that turned out to be a real loudmouth.
Selling wolf tickets, threatening all the other artists, and so they wanted him handled.
And Shyne and me got the memo.
You do realize the Feds aren't gonna let this go, right?
(SIGHS)
Who else knows?
You, me and Tommy and Rosey.
(CLICKS TONGUE, SIGHS)
But the both of them, they coming to Hakeem's wedding, you know.
We still tight.
And they're legit now, so they got just as much to lose.
Right, right. And that's why the Feds are all over Shyne.
Yeah, but Shyne... he's a idiot thug, you know.
He ain't no snitch.
Know our past got to stay buried.
Mm-hmm.

Lucious.

Especially one of his own sons.
(DOOR BUZZING, LOCK CLICKS)
You got ten minutes.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
You know you broke my heart, Freda.
Why would you try and shoot me?
You know why.
I don't know why.
You killed my father.
Carol told me.
Why would you listen to a crackhead?
Look, the last conversation I had with your father was about you.
Why do you think I tried to reach out to you in the first place?
'Cause you felt guilty.
The circumstances under which me and your father grew up, the violence?
That's why, when I saw you when you came to visit him, and I saw this talent in you that... that was something worth saving.
Promise you, I never laid a finger on your daddy.
But this ain't about him no more.
This is about my son.
This is about Jamal.
You care about him, right?
You know I care about him.
Yeah, well, he's in a real bad place right now.
And no matter how you spin it, he's in that place because of the choices that you made.
Now...
I don't really care what anybody think about me.
Yeah, I'm a selfish son of a bitch.
Life made me like this.
But...
Jamal's not.

: We would really rather he didn't attend.
Look, Maria, Arturo, they're my parents' people, okay?
I respect where they come from.
Mom and Dad, one of the main reasons I'm marrying Laura is to break away from that history.

He brought hookers to your son's wedding.
Oh, oh! Uh! Look at that!
(LAUGHING)
I'm out of here, L.
No, no, no, no, no. Come on.
No, no, no, no.
Come with us into the other room.
Feds is still sniffing around, and we have to make sure Shyne behaves.
It's precautionary, mostly.
Mad 'cause they got a bag full of nothing, just a lame-ass task force who came up empty on something I didn't do.
Free Lucious.
Hell of a concert.
: Yes, thank you.
Now, uh, you guys know how the Feds work, or else you wouldn't have stayed clear of them all these years.
So it is very important that we keep Shyne as a part of our circle of silence.
Yeah, but if somebody already gave them Shyne...
It means Shyne's not our only problem.
(SIGHS)
Well, there was a couple of friends that...
Let's just say they're not around to snitch anymore.
: They've recently retired.
Now, Shyne on the other hand, you know, he's just a kid.
He wants to be part of the club again.
All right, Lucious.
But nothing good can come from Shyne's punk ass.
Understood.
We'll just entertain him for a bit, okay?
Let's go do this wedding.
That's a plan.
We love you, my darling.
We only want the best for you.
We hope Hakeem keeps you safe.

My brother about to drop this album.
All y'all gonna want a piece of this one. It's hot.
Hey, I know it's all crazy, but it's all gonna work out, okay?
Thank you for coming, Anika.
Anika Calhoun, you've been served.
See you in court.
What?!

No!
What's happening?
: Stop! Stop her!
Move!
: Sir, get out of the way!
Get off!
Get off!
Mm-hmm. Grand jury.
What the hell is going on?
: What?!
Get off me!
Get off me!
: This is exactly what I was talking about.
I'm putting a stop to it.
Shyne, you're a damn fool!
That's why we dumped you the first time and why we keep your ghetto ass in place!
: Laura, wait!
(SOBS)
Baby, I got it all under control.
It was just a little argument.
It's gonna be okay.
It's not okay anymore, Hakeem.
I can't.
This isn't gonna be my life.
I'm sorry.
Baby, I'm sorry.
I can't do this.
Let go of me!
It's gonna be all right.
You're all a bunch of thugs.
Please don't go.
: Okay.
Everybody get the hell out of here.
Go on!
Now!
I said go!
Walk away. Go!
Lucious, stop it!
: I'm not playing!
Webb, shut the door!
: All right, look, just tell me what to do.
I'll do whatever it takes in order to not testify.
Okay, the hell with it.
Thirsty, if Anika and I get married...
Wait, what?
...the Feds can't force her to testify... right or wrong?
Lucious.
: That thought crossed my mind, but you'd need a marriage license.
The Feds would definitely block that.
We already got that covered when we were engaged in D.C.
Lucious! I'm warning you.
You're warning me what?
No, you can't do it. This is my wedding.
She carrying my baby.
Yeah, man, are we sick or something?
Is... We were supposed to end the cycle.
Cycle ends when it's ready to end.
Till then, we do what we have to do.
I did not save this bitch's life so that she could ruin mine.
There's got to be another way.
No, there ain't no other way.
Look, look, this is just a paper game.
It ain't real. It doesn't affect where you and I are.
: Hey, Lucious, this has to be done tonight.
We're ride or die.
I need you on this one.
You got to ride with me on this one.
(SCOFFS)
Y'all know I love you, right?
You know.
And I'm-a do whatever I can... to save my family.
But me and your daddy...
I can't do this.
Get your hands off me!
(BREATH QUIVERING)
Ma.
No. No.
Anika Calhoun, do you take Lucious Lyon to be your lawfully wedded husband?
I do.
: Lucious Lyon, do you take Anika Calhoun to be your wife?
I do.
: With the powers conferred on me by the state of New York, before God... and your family, I declare you're married.
You may kiss the bride.
Sing.
: You heard your father. Get up and sing.
I know you pushed her.
Excuse me for a minute, please.
