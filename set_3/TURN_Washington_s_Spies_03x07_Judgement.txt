Charges of corruption, of impropriety, and when I clear my name once and for all, I won't even need the British.
Becky, who's Philomena?.
♪♪
You're a rebel.
You're a tory.
I never want to see your face again.
We'll scour this island, 
 until we find our notorious Mr. Culper.
: 
Neither do I, but it's the only way.
We could talk to him. He might listen.
He's never gonna listen.
Abe.
If you strike your father with such force he cannot stand, you could injure him far worse...
I'm not gonna kill him.
And don't think of him as my father, all right?
He is the man keeping our son from us.
Abe...
Look, once I get Thomas, we'll go straight to the cove.
Caleb will be heading there soon, all right?
Simcoe.
Hide the trunk. Hide the trunk.
Is Rogers with him?
No, I don't see him.
Captain.
Good day.
Woodhull. Mrs. Woodhull.
Did you... did you get him?
Did you get Rogers?
His capture is imminent.
In the meantime, you'll be glad to know we retrieved a piece of your stolen property.
These are your initials, are they not?
Would have been polite to warn me he was armed, don't you agree?
Yeah, I... I'm sorry.
Rogers had just mugged us and I didn't want to confuse it by...
Owning a proscribed weapon that should have been surrendered to the garrison last May.
Yeah.
I understand.
I was confused by something as well.
Of all the people to rob in Setauket, why did Robert Rogers only choose you?
We're all alone out here and...
Please.
I want to hear your husband lie 
No? Come.
Captain.
(grunts)
And now for a task long overdue.
: No. No!
Wait, wait, wait! You were right.
Ah, here we go.
You were right what you said on the road.
Rogers is Culper.
Is he now?
Yes, I've been helping him for over a year.
Abe!
Ever since the murder of Captain Joyce.
Oh, yes, I heard about that during my unfortunate captivity.
They said the drummer did it.
No, Rogers said the drummer did it. It was Robeson.
John Robeson was the real killer.
He and Joyce were a pair of mollies. I'm the one who found out.
And when I went to Rogers and I told him, he used it against Robeson.
He blackmailed him. He threatened him.
He forced him to spy and forced me to watch over him.
Forced you?
All right, he told me that someone else would be watching me, that he had watchers all over Setauket reporting to him, giving him shelter.
He said that if I didn't watch over Robeson, he would reveal that I had been with Anna Strong.
That if I ever betrayed him, the death of my son would be the last thing that I ever saw.
All right? That is what he does.
He finds out everything about you, your secrets and your shame, and he ties it around your neck like a noose and he chokes you.
Now I had no other choice.
I thought I had heard your last lie, but that was quite impressive.
No, I can prove it to you!
I have proof. I'll show you.
I can prove it to you.
So this was his lair?
Yeah, one of them as far as I know.
You were supposed to kill him.
You may as well kill me. I am a dead man now that you've seen this place.
Have Cavil and Pierce post hunting blinds, one on the north tree line and one in the horse stable.
Yes, sir.
Don't worry, you'll hardly know they're there.
We can't stay here. Didn't you hear Abe?
Rogers will come for us and Thomas, too.
Your son is safe at Whitehall. If you wish to join him there, you're welcome.
Your husband shall remain here.
As you say, you're already dead.
But you can still serve a purpose.
What? No.
Get Thomas, get to the cove.
What about you?
Don't worry about me.
Get to Caleb. That's all you need to think about.
 will come a day ♪
I believe you will find everything to your liking.
We'll have a cook, a housemaid, but unfortunately the other servants are on leave.
I will make do just fine, Benedict.
But you shouldn't have to.
Peggy, Congress is withholding a great sum owed to me.
But once this court-martial business is settled, then they will pay me back in full, I assure you.
And you are certain you will win?
All I must do is show them the truth.
That I am loyal to the cause and not the treasonous villain that Joseph Reed makes me out to be.
You saw yourself.
I could not do it.
I would no sooner betray my country than I would you.
I have always seen the virtue in your candor, but when you're in trial, take care that it's not accompanied by anger.
And instead of saying "I," try to say "our country" whenever you can.
Identify yourself with the army so that when Reed attacks you, he's really attacking America herself.
You make me a better man with every word that you speak.
My words are only meant to help you convey your loyalty.
That is what makes the man.
I'm ready, John.
Took quite a lot to perfect the high roll.
Did I get it right?
You spent so much money tailoring this dress.
Sure you want me to take it off?
Leave it on.
(breathing heavily)
: 
Abigail.
You were supposed to be halfway to Philadelphia by now.
I'm sorry. The checkpoint requires your signature now, sir.
They sent me back.
Give me the letter.
I want to explain.
There's no need to.
It is unfortunate, but sometimes my job requires unorthodox methods to achieve results.
I think it best that word of this does not travel with you.
(bird squawking)
: 
That's all you need to think about.
(screaming)
Whoa.
There in the trees. It's him.
It's him. It's Rogers.
There's nothing out there. She's just jumpy.
No, he saw me and he hid behind the trees.
I swear it's him. It's Robert Rogers. He's gonna kill me.
We can't chase every ghost that frightens you, ma'am.
Boone, take Fitch and Odell to search the woods.
All the way down to Frog's Cove.
: 
He looked at me. I saw his horrible, bearded face.
: 
In the meantime, you may ride with me if it makes you feel safer.
Stay close. (clicks tongue)
(chatter)
Come on. Come on. Move it.
Have you told him yet?
You have to tell him.
Better to offer no excuse than a bad one.
But it's not an excuse.
It's truth. He needs to hear it.
I need answers before I can answer to him.
And if I wait until Abe returns, then I can make a full report on exactly how this ring has dissolved.
But until that happy day, I have other duties to attend to.
But you're going to walk into General Washington's tent this day or the next and you don't want to explain what took you so long.
Major.
A gang of Tories was just brought into camp.
What, militia?
Partisans.
They're in the stockade ready for interrogation.
Thank you.
Other duties.
They ambushed a patrol about 10 miles south, then fled when reinforcements came.
Our men pursued them to a farmhouse where they made a stand.
We lost one man, another's with the chaplain.
10 miles south, you said? Where exactly?
: 
Wasn't sure what to do with her.
Right, well, clear the barn out.
Separate the prisoners. I'll question them one by one.
(bird cawing)
(branches snapping)
(gunshot)
She was right. It's Rogers.
Report to the captain.
Aye.
Odell, you're with me.
You need a little warm-up?
You sure?
These nights can get pretty cold.
I have spoken to the soldiers involved in the exchange.
They all say that they saw a woman from the window firing along with the rest.
It was my home.
Have I not the right to defend it?
So you were protecting these Tories, then?
Just as I did with you.
Sarah... just give me something.
Anything that I can use to help you.
All right? Were... were you pressured?
Did you aid these men under some sort of threat?
I didn't aid anything.
I helped plan the ambush.
I led them back to my house when our plan went wrong.
How long had... exactly how long have you been a part of this?
Since I learned I couldn't stay out of this war.
Since the day it came to my doorstep and into my home.
But that's not what you wanted to hear, though, is it?
I wanted to hear the truth.
And I... and I wanted to thank you.
Properly thank you for what you did.
You want to thank me, Major Tallmadge?
Then return the favor and get me out of here.
Mary, might we have a word in private?
No.
I don't know what vapors have gotten hold of you, but this is important.
: 
We chased Rogers down to Oyster Bay.
What could possibly be in Setauket to warrant the risk of returning?
Falkoff has a point, Mrs. Woodhull.
I know what I saw.
Captain! Captain!
We spotted him by the water.
Robert Rogers.
Are you certain?
He shot at us and we found his boat.
The others are after him now.
I told you that he was out there.
You need to bring my husband here where it's safe.
So he traveled by water.
That's how he evaded us at Oyster Bay.
Well, he's lost his keel now.
Deploy all the men to search Setauket.
And the coves.
And have them stay in teams of four this time.
Are you not concerned you may be leaving us unprotected?
I'll remain for your protection. That's more than enough.
Post four reserves on the perimeter.
Well-hidden and eyes out.
He's returned for me.
(men chatting)
: 
: 
Captain Shewell was generally regarded as a Tory.
He even was directed by the commander-in-chief to leave the army encampment on pain of imprisonment.
For a treacherous captain who was ordered to leave Patriot territory 
Yes.
For a profit in his favor, I should add.
Secretary Matlack, to your knowledge, was I aware of Captain Shewell's reputation when I granted him passage?
Everyone was aware, especially after news of General Washington's order spread through the city.
Yes, you said that.
And do you know where I was when this news came to Philadelphia?
Up north.
With the army.
I was off to battle.
Can you see, then, how these petty issues of whom to trade with might not have crossed my mind?
Maybe.
But I heard profits were made in your favor.
But this is not a matter of profit sharing.
It is a matter of granting a captain of accused loyalism access to our ports.
Speaking of which, have you understood that upon several alarms this past year, Captain Shewell turned out with the Continental militia and did duty with them?
I know nothing of that matter.
Well, I suppose that's excusable, Secretary.
In times of war, we must not always hold men responsible for what they are not aware of.
(men murmuring)
: While the squash is boiling, stew the apples tender.
I'll come back to add the dry bread.
You're preparing a meal now?
Why are you pretending there's nothing wrong when everything is?
Excuse me.
The captain is in a more dangerous season than you know.
I know well enough.
He threatened your son.
When?
Just last week.
Now, Thomas is with Aberdeen.
I want you to take him and flee at your first chance.
I know the tale that you and Abe spun about Rogers is a lie.
Then you know if I flee with Thomas, Abe will be exposed.
The truth will come to light on its own.
And when it does, you do not want Thomas anywhere near here.
You may be able to stand by and watch Abe's demise, but I cannot.
Simcoe is not a problem that will go away.
Unless he does.
What do you mean by that?
What are you planning to do?
Then widen the search. Captain wants to keep the old man running.
Aye, sir.
(distant men chattering)
You will report only what you come upon naturally and only when it's safe.
We have many ways of keeping our correspondence secret.
You want me to spy on my neighbors?
Even though it was you who lied to me about who you were, you still don't know who I am.
Look, Sarah, you want out of here, this is how you get out.
By turning against my own?
This is the favor you return?
Then lie.
All right? Just sign it.
And then once you're gone, you do as you will.
Just know I won't be able to protect you a second time.
And when the war is over and this letter is discovered, what then?
Am I to hang beside you from the gallows?
Sarah, don't you see by letting you go like this, I'm all but committing treason?
I know.
But I was the one who chose to fight.
I chose because I was ready to die for my beliefs.
But I'm not ready to die for yours.
: 
John.
How did you get in here?
Oh, Cicero, is it?
(chuckles)
♪ If with me you'll fondly stray ♪

♪ Over the hills and... ♪
This is not your cup, Philomena.
This is not your home.
I know.
I thought I'd surprise you.
But I can always delay my arrivals, as you know.
Perhaps you should delay indefinitely.
Excuse me?
We... this has come to its end.
If you need me to be the lady from the sketch...
You could never be her.
I was a fool to ever think you could.
(fire crackling)
He overestimates me.
Regaining Arnold's interest in resuming correspondence may be far past my reach.
Tell me, how does the good major pass his days now?
He keeps busy with his responsibilities.
No hobbies? Amusements?
He plays on his violin still.
Does he wake you and your son up with his early practice?
(laughs) We don't mind.
I minded.
(laughs)
And I assume he still keeps relations with Philomena Cheer.
It's true, then?
It's not what it seems.
How? How is it not?
His profession can sometimes require him to steer certain people in ways that are unorthodox.
As he did with me.
No. No.
He writes to me, but all he really wants is Arnold.
Miss Peggy, he loves you.
Please leave, Abigail.
Please.
(crying)
This charge is about giving menial offices to a freeman of the militia.
Menial offices?
We order men to put their heads in front of cannons, yet God forbid we ask one to fetch a barber.
(men chuckling)
It was only to point out a pattern of misconduct.
Such as with the military wagons you used...
With my own quid, Mr. Reed.
Yes, they were military, but they were not in use.
You see, this is a civilian's vendetta.
He and his council have harassed the military establishment in Philadelphia ever since we took it back.
This is not about the army. This is about you.
I was one of the first who appeared in the field.
And from that time to the present hour, I have not abandoned her service.
And now I am faced with this.
This vile prostitution of power.
Such instances of glaring tyranny and injustice, I believe, are unprecedented in the annals of any free people.
Gentlemen, I ask you, is this the nation that these free states are fighting for?
: 
 the court does fully acquit Major General Arnold.
With respect to the first and last charges, the court has determined to sentence Major General Arnold a reprimand from His Excellency, the commander-in-chief.
A reprimand? Only a reprimand?
This court-martial is adjourned.

Cavil, that you?
Boone?
Come here.
What the hell?
I bought us two minutes. We got to go.
Where's Mary? What's going on?
Mary?
Did you leave them down at the cove?
The cove?
Yeah.
What? No.
The only thing I left at the cove was my boat.
The Rangers were there. They were ready.
They knew I was coming, right?
And they said something about Rogers.
No, I got it in their minds that he's here in Setauket.
They couldn't have known that you were down at the cove. No one knew.
Except Mary.
You damn near blew our heads off.
It's Rogers. I knew this was a bad idea.
Shh, do you hear that?
It's him. We're good as gudgeons out here if we don't get someplace safe.
Cabin.
Woody, they're coming. We've got to go now.
Simcoe has made her talk.
What? We got to go.
No, you have to get to Whitehall.
You got to check on Mary and Thomas.
Whitehall?
Yes.
Go. Hurry.
All right.
Good luck.
Thank you. Go.
What the hell is going on out there?
The old bear's come for your head.
I told you. He's everywhere.
We're gonna do him a little favor if you don't shut up.
Now sit down. We're gonna hunker here awhile.
I've been at this post awhile.
You may find it hard to believe, but Major Tallmadge isn't the only one who can offer special treatment.
It's a blessing being a lady prisoner.
You're drunk.
I don't need your kindness.
Don't worry. My kindness doesn't require much.
Hey.
(groaning)
(gunshot echoes)
Firearms ready!
It came from over there!
You two, check the other prisoners.
Aye, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh, God.
What... what happened? What happened?!
She tried to escape.
And so you shot her?
Your face.
I can explain...

Sir!

Leave him!
Get him off him now!

: 
I wanted to say I'm sorry for not coming forward sooner about Robert Rogers.
We were living in fear and that led to regrettable choices.
And since it is to be a long night for you, I've made you some of my winter squash pie and collops of rabbit.
Thank you.
You were able to spot Rogers in the wood when my trained militia could not.
Perhaps you'd wish to join me.
I must decline.
I've just had a warm bath made upstairs.
Very well.

: 
(Rangers shouting)
: 
This way.
Hold it!
It's Rogers. He's here.
He's here.
Mrs. Woodhull.
Come on, we need to get you inside now. Come on, come on.
Ma'am, come on. Please.
Wait, wait.
Come on. Please, come on.
No, stop. Stop it!
No! No, let me go!
What are you doing out here?

: 
Sir, there was a... a gunshot.
Where is he?!
Sir, sir!
They got Fitch.
No, no.
How did he get behind the lines?
Fall back to the house, now!
She's got them running around in circles.
Let's look in the back.
How about the cellar?
Nothing.
You two, with me.
(breathing heavily)
(sounds echoing)
Sorry to alarm you, but I wanted to make sure you were safe.
I'm... I'm just having a bath.
Aren't you going to ask me if I'm all right?
You want Rogers? I'll give you Rogers.
: The tree line!
: Over there!
Loose your guns!
(gunshot)
Spread out!
(gasping)
(sobbing)
Thank you, Robert.
Henry, you can count on the Virginia militia.
Remember that.
General.
You had it printed? The entire court record?
In English and French.
To be distributed throughout America and Europe.
At quite the expense, I'd imagine.
I want the world to know of my exoneration.
And that justice is valued in this army.
Well, you certainly earned it.
Congratulations, sir.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other matters to attend to.
A row between two of our officers over prisoner treatment or some such.
Henry, wait.
General, I, um...
I plan to return to Philadelphia today, but not before settling the matter of my reimbursement.
Reimbursement?
Four years' back pay.
And debts from my Canada expeditions.
As you say, this was printed at quite the expense.
Benedict, Congress is bankrupt.
I've been going without. We've all been going without.
Yes, but I...
Surely you didn't think the court-martial was holding back your money.
And you did that, sir.
That in the end will hold more weight than coin.
Benedict, I read it.
I read it. You were...
Your absence these past days has given me a realization.
You have your fortune and your honor restored.
You should have the wife meant to go with them.
What?
I don't want to wait until March.
I want to be married now.
I thought you'd be pleased.
Nothing could make me happier.
But I need a respite.
My leg.
Of course.
