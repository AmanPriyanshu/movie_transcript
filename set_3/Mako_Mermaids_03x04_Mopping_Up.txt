Congratulations. You're now as fast as us.
I had good coaches.
And you're a good student.
So, when can I start to use this thing?
It's not that simple.
Without proper training, moon rings are incredibly dangerous.
Well, then, someone will have to teach me how to use it safely.
Any takers?
The pod did appoint you as an official teacher.
That was for little mermaids.
Are you saying that you can't teach me?
 Don't be ridiculous. Of course I could teach you.
Good!
When do we start?
Let's go.
The most important thing to learn about using a moon ring is to focus.
Have a clear idea in your head of exactly what you want the object to do, then make it obey.
It takes some people a while to master, but don't worry, once you do, it becomes second nature.
Wow, that's... that's amazing.
: Sounds pretty ordinary to me.
 This isn't what you'd normally use a moon ring for.
It holds the power of the full moon, so it's used for very complex and potent magic, but you have to start small so you understand how it works.
Once you've mastered that, we can move onto more serious applications.
Not all magic is serious.
Mermaids in my pod used to do all sorts of tricks with their moon rings.
That's your pod, not ours.
What sort of tricks?
They'd shape clumps of seaweed to look like land people then make them dance on top of the water.
That sounds like fun.
: Ondina and I did something similar when we first got our moon rings.
No, we didn't.
Yes, we did.
We used to freeze water in the shapes of giant sea creatures, put them in front of boats and then shatter them.
It was so funny watching the fishermen react.
Sounds like a very serious use of your moon rings.
Obviously, that was some other mermaid.
Ondina, you even named the trick.
You called it "Freezy Scare."
Even if I had done that, I certainly wouldn't do it now.
Moon rings are not toys.
Now, back to the lesson.
Remember, Evie, it's all about focus and intent.
Now you try it.
: Joe, we have to talk about this.
There's nothing to talk about, all right?
The decision's been made.
You made the decision.
I wasn't even consulted. That's not fair.
What's not fair?
Joe wants to close the café. Tell him he can't.
No way. This place is awesome.
Look, there are plenty of places you can get burgers and juice, you know.
You know this place is more than just a café.
It's like a community. People rely on it.
: Yeah, especially young people like us.
We need it to... keep us off the streets.
Does it look like I wanna run a youth center?
It's still a good business.
Yeah, and my fishing boat is a better one, okay?
I use the cash I've got tied up here to buy new equipment, I'm going to make even more money.
Not everything's about money.
That's a good one. I'm going to have to use that.
Sorry, guys, as of Friday, this place is over.
How does he get to make the decision anyway?
You're half-owner.
Yeah, but without his half, I don't have the money to run the place.
If he pulls the plug, that's it.
Hey, Dad.
If you're looking for a cup, you might try the sink.
I thought we had an agreement.
I take care of the bathroom, you do the kitchen.
I meant to be back and have it done before you got up, but... I lost track of time.
Well, where were you so early?
Just went for a swim.
Mmm.
That's every morning this week.
Look, I don't want to stop you having free time but you need to do your bit around here.
I know.
Honey, we're a team, yeah?
We've got to act like a team, back each other up.
I'm sorry, Dad.
All right.
Well, I've got a charter to take out, and I'll see you tonight.
Okay. Bye.
Bye.
Hmm.
"Have a clear idea of what you want it to do.
Now make it obey."
It's not gonna be the same without the café.
All the great times we've had here.
All the great girls I've met here... none of which compare to Carly.
Oh, no.
What?
Evie's going to lose her shop.
Carly's going to lose her job.
Well, that settles it.
We have to find a way to keep this place open.
It shouldn't be a problem for a couple of smart guys like us.
Must be somewhere we can all hang out.
It doesn't have to be fancy.
It doesn't even have to be a café.
Hmm. Personally speaking, no food is a deal breaker.
Well, it wouldn't have to be somewhere we buy food.
We could cook our own. Like a barbecue.
We could bring our own drinks.
We could use my bungalow.
Can't wait to see what your olds think about that.
Well, where's your bright ideas?
I... can't think on an empty stomach.
You're right.
Slow down!
Stop!
Stop, you stupid thing!
We could hold an auction.
I like it. What are we auctioning?
You and me.
We'd be servants for a day.
What would we do?
Anything the person who bought us wanted.
Anything?
Anything.
Within reason.
Okay, we should make a list 'cause there's some things the Camster won't do.
I have allergies.
It was just an idea.
Not one of your better ones.
I'm still not hearing anything from you.
I better call Evie, tell her the bad news. 
Did David tell you?
Yep.
Bummer, hey?
Yeah.
Banana and strawberry smoothie.
You're taking this pretty well.
Nothing I can do.
That's pretty mature. I thought you'd be cut.
You're always telling me how much you like working here.
We need more strawberries.
I don't think Joe has any idea what damage he's doing.
I mean, there's Evie's shop to consider.
Strawberries are supposed to be right here.
Where are they?
They're right in front of you.
And then there's your singing.
I mean, you only just got started in your new career and pow!
It's out the window.
How tragic is that?
It's okay, they're only strawberries.
 It's not the strawberries!
This is the best job that I'll ever have.
Anywhere else... and I won't get to sing.
The customers will just be customers, not friends.
It's not fair.
It'll be okay.
No, it won't.
Yes, it will.
Just don't ask me how.
 Zac.
Hey, Evie.
 I've got something to tell you.
Is Mimmi or Ondina there?
Uh, no, no.
Hey, listen, I've got some really bad news.
Yeah, so do I.
Evie, I'm sorry but the café is closing.
 quick!
Good mop.
Nice mop.
No!
Got a sec?
I'm kind of busy.
See, I'm wondering if you've really thought this whole thing through.
What's there to think about?
Closing the café has... a tremendous social cost.
Meaning what exactly?
You know how many couples met at the Ocean Café?
How many first dates happened there?
Well, they can happen somewhere else.
What about your employees, who have given you years of loyal service, worked their fingers to the bone without complaints?
You can't just dump them on the street.
Can you stop this sob-sister routine?
They can find jobs elsewhere.
Times are tough, Joe.
Jobs don't grow on trees.
I am not running a charity. I'm in business to make a profit.
So, if you're here offering to buy my share, start talking.
I thought not.
: So what's the big emergency?
Look.
I can't even get into my own house.
You didn't--
I know.
Moon rings are dangerous.
I shouldn't have used it until I was trained.
I thought Ondina was giving you lessons.
I don't even know why you're here.
Can we just stop this thing before my dad gets home?
There has to be a fix. It's just a mop, right?
I don't know a lot about mops.
We don't have much use for them underwater.
What exactly did you do to it?
I was getting it to clean the floors.
It got stuck in the bucket, so I just gave it an extra jolt.
 Come on.
Psst!
Evie!
Stop it!
: It's getting away!
It's going to mop the entire street. We have to stop it!
Hi, Joe.
What part of "I'm not running a charity" don't you understand?
I understand perfectly.
You're a businessman and you're running a business.
So?
So, I thought you might like to hear a business proposition.
 From you?
Why not?
Since you are a businessman, can you really afford not to listen?
Sorry, I'm afraid we can't take orders for next week.
Friday's our--
Hi, sorry about that.
What day were you looking at?
Tuesday? Fine.
And what would you like?
Uh-huh. Yep.
Four seafood platters, ready first thing for pick-up Tuesday.
Not a problem. See you then.
Are you nuts? What are you doing?
The café closes Friday, remember?
Really? That's not what I heard.
Word is the café's got a new co-owner.
What?
Who?
You're kidding. You?
That's right, partner.
Where did you get the money?
I used my savings, and also a loan from my dad.
Actually, mostly a loan from my dad.
Why would your dad give you a loan?
He said it was a good way for me to learn how business works.
Also, I begged him.
You saved the café.
And my job.
Just doing what any hero would do.
 Thank you, thank you, thank you!
I owe you, Cam.
Think nothing of it.
Look, if there's anything I can do, anything at all...
Actually... there is one thing.
Name it.
I'm pretty thirsty.
One large tropical juice coming right up.
Actually, better make it a small. Don't want to eat into our profits, do we?
Where do you even start looking for a runaway mop?
Somewhere with dirty floors or good-looking buckets?
 Come on.
Here mop, mop, mop.
Here, moppie.
I really doubt that's going to work.
Gotcha!
: Zac!
This ends now.
What's the plan?
Anybody got an idea?
Don't be shy. Speak up.
Ondina.
Freezy Scare.
Let's do it.
Yes!
That is one ex-mop.
We rock.
Yes, we do.
Mmm, very nice.
And so is this. You've done a fantastic job.
Just being a team player. 
Uh, Dad.
: Oops.
Sorry.
Now who's letting the team down?
Ah, just... just leave it. I'll do it.
No, no. You've done your fair share.
Have you seen the mop?
What do you think?
Perfect.
I think I need a necklace.
You never wear necklaces.
What do you think?
I like it.
You should wear it.
Hmm.
Evie certainly got the hang of her moon ring fast.
I agree. She has great ability.
Although, she did have a pretty good teacher.
Who may have instilled a slight sense of overconfidence in her student.
All right, I admit Evie went a bit far, but I'll be there to keep an eye on her, make sure she stays on track.
And Mimmi and I will be there to keep an eye on you and make sure you don't get into trouble.
That necklace...
 I wouldn't.
Hmm.
Ladies, gentlemen and others...
I'd like to welcome you all here tonight, the first of many special nights here at the Ocean Café.
As some of you may know... we've had a recent change of management here.
A forward thinking co-owner has agreed to come on board and shake things up.
I'm sure you're all wondering who this generous benefactor is--
That's you, Cam.
And the spoiler award goes to Zac Blakely.
As I was saying, we're planning many changes, the first of which... our new house band.
Now, I'd like to throw over to a voice that we are all very familiar with, especially when she's yelling that the toasted sandwiches are burnt.
Carly.
Go Carly.
Go Carly.
: Whoo!
Uh, I'd like to dedicate this first song to the guy that made all of this possible.
I know that he thinks he's special, but... he doesn't know just how special he is.
One, two, three.
