Previously on "The Flash"...
Barry, what you're seeing is the Speed Force...
Your past, your present, your future.
Say, Iris, you look amazing.
Thanks, Tony.
His skin changed. It turned to metal.
Tony might have been a bully, but he didn't deserve to die.
Barry, you've always had someone to come home to.
I can't help but wonder... Maybe we were meant to be together.
You lost your powers?
I gave them up to save Wally.
I can re-create the circumstances to get you your speed back.
Let's set up the particle accelerator.
[screaming]
Barry... he's gone.
[sparks popping]
This wasn't su...
I didn't...
I'm so sorry.
We lost him.
No, no, no, no, he...
He could've got knocked somewhere or maybe even run there.
[melancholy music]
Nothing on the GPS.
There were strikes all over the building.
Jesse, come down here, please.
[sparks popping]
Jesse?
Wally?
[tense music]
Oh, God, Wally!
No, no!
Wally! Wally, wake up!
No!
Can you hear me?
Wally!
Jesse, Jesse!
Jesse!
Wally!
Jesse!
[grunts]
Stop yelling, please.
Her heart stopped.
Her heart stopped!
Jesse...
Are you okay?
Jesse!
[gasps]
Oh...
[panting]
It's beating. Her heart's beating.
[sighs]
Henry's a doctor. He should see her.
I'm so glad you're okay.
Hey, what's with him?
It's Barry.
Barry's gone.
Are you good, Wally?
Okay, we should get you home, get some rest, okay?
I don't understand.
No, it's okay. Let's go.
Jesse.
Henry, Wells' daughter is upstairs.
The energy hit her too.
[melancholy music]
Her heart stopped beating.
Henry!
All right.
[whirring]
[humming]
[whirring]
I saw him!
I saw Barry.
He's alive.
[dramatic music]
[chuckling]
[foreboding music]
Joe?
Good to see you, Barry.
But I'm not Joe.
You're not?
No.
And all of this?
It's not real?
How do you feel, being back here?
I feel awful.
We thought you'd be more comfortable talking to someone who looked familiar and in a place you knew.
"We"?
Who's "we," exactly?
That's a little hard to explain.
Sit, Barry.
Sit.
How much do you know about the Speed Force?
It's the source of my power. It's what makes me a speedster.
Yes... and no.
When the first subatomic particle sprang forth from the Big Bang to form reality as you know it, we were there.
When the last proton decays, stops vibrating, and plunges the universe into heat death, we'll be there too.
I'm talking to the Speed Force?
Isn't that like saying I'm having a conversation with gravity or light or...
You need a minute.
It's okay if you do.
It's a lot to take in.
So you're saying I'm... I'm talking to the source of my power, which just so happens to look like... my adoptive dad?
That's trippy. [laughing]
We pretty much invented trippy here.
Look, I'm... I'm not sure why you brought me here, but you need to send me back.
My friends are in danger from Zoom.
[whooshing]
Did you see that?
[dramatic music]
You're not going back.
Not until...
Till what?
Until you catch that.
Cisco says Barry's still alive.
Where is he?
I don't know.
Harry, I vibed him in the center of a storm.
It was, like, in, like, a vortex or something.
He's in...
He's in the Speed Force.
Get him out, damn it.
I...
You can get him out, can't you?
I don't know if I can.
Henry, come here.
Listen, you are the only one that can help Jesse.
Let me sit on Wells till he figures out what the hell he did to Barry.
I think we can get him back.
Joe, I know you love Barry, okay?
But you have Iris, and you have Wally.
Barry's all I have left.
I promise.
We'll find him.
Thank God you're here.
Caitlin's usually the one doing this, but...
Heart rate's normal.
Reflexes and breathing are fine.
She should be waking up.
She's just not.
It was the same with Barry.
Um, after the first accident, he was in a coma that no one could explain.
What did you do with him?
So they brought him here... Well, Wells brought him here.
The other Wells.
Right, the Wells who was actually Thawne.
Eobard, not Eddie.
Right.
It's... it's complicated.
Anyway, we took care of Barry while Wells...
Thawne... treated him.
Are there any records of that treatment?
We might find clues how to help Jesse.
Uh, yeah, they'd be downstairs in the storage room, in the morgue.
Ew, you guys have a morgue?
Well, it's not like a morgue morgue.
It's not... it's like a poor man's morgue, really. Morgue-ish.
Would one of you go get them, please?
Okay, well, I'm not going alone.
[sighs]
Thank you.
Okay, so it's a morgue morgue.
But, you know, we had to keep the dead meta-humans somewhere.
Yeah, looks like you did a lot more than just store them.
Fake Wells might've done a few dissections for study purposes.
And this didn't tip any of you off that he might be secretly evil?
It was a crazy time, okay?
We had a lot going on.
I'll tell you what...
It's a good thing Thawne was so organized.
[thud, clatter]
Would you stop knocking stuff over?
You stop. I didn't touch anything.
Okay, whatever you say.
Okay, this is it. This is Barry's ex-file.
[crash]
[snarling]
[suspenseful music]
A zombie?
For real?
[exciting music]
[screaming]
Tony?
Nope, not Tony... Not anymore.
Get behind me.
You get behind me.
[screaming]
Tony!
[moaning]
[grunting]
[screaming]
[glass shatters]
Ooh!
Oh.
Didn't see that one coming.
No.
Zombie Girder. [chuckles] This...
[glass shattering]
[panting]
Iris.
We're glad you made it, Barry.
[sighs]
Not Iris.
It's just you again.
[dramatic music]
Sit, Barry. Sit.
You're always on your feet.
You remember this place, where we first kissed?
Yeah, of course, except that wasn't you.
We thought you'd find this place and our appearance less upsetting.
Yet you seem upset.
My friends, my city... my whole world is in danger.
Zoom is on a rampage with the power that he stole from me, and you are keeping me here.
You were given a rare and precious gift, and you rejected it.
No, I did not reject it.
I gave up my powers to save someone's life...
To be a hero.
I nearly killed myself trying to get them back, when you brought me here, wherever here is.
That's not what we meant.
Okay.
If you would rather have given these powers to somebody else, why did you give them to me?
Because you're The Flash, Barry.
[sighs] We got a new problem.
Our accelerator experiment seems to have reanimated one of the dead metas in our morgue.
"Reanimated," like brought back to life?
Life-ish. You ever seen "The Walking Dead"?
It's "The Walking Dead," but without higher brain function and with major rage issues.
Still unsure if our brains are on the menu, though.
Which one?
Tony Woodward.
The bully from school who turned into the metal man?
That's not good, Cisco.
History repeats itself.
First as tragedy and then as farce.
[tense music]
Wells, as a parent, believe me, I have nothing but sympathy for what you're going through.
Listen to me closely when I say to you, we got a lot of fires burning at the same time, and if we all work together, we just might be able to put them out.
Let Henry take care of your daughter.
Me and Iris will handle this Girder situation, but you and Cisco are the scientists.
You're the only one who can bring Barry back from wherever the hell he is right now.
Ramon... give those medical records to Henry, and meet me in the Breach Room in five minutes.
We've got work to do.
Now we just need to find Tony.
Yeah, hopefully before he kills someone.
Come on.
[ominous music]
Big Belly Burger in Starling City is way better.
This place sucks.
[car alarm beeps]
[snarling]
Oh, my God. Is that your car?
Oh, yeah.
[glass breaking]
[car alarm blaring]
That's my mom's car!
So how do we know this is safe?
Well, define "safe."
Safe, as in my brain's not gonna melt.
No. It's a simple feedback loop, Ramon, all right?
When you vibe on Barry, your brain waves send me the necessary data to pinpoint whatever dimensional pocket or corner of the universe that Barry is stuck in.
And then we electrically stimulate your prefrontal cortex while opening a breach, which gives you physical access to Barry and lets you be the beacon to guide him home.
Simple feedback loop.
I'm sorry. Did you say electrically stimulate?
Ramon, do you want to bring Barry back or not?
[dramatic music]
[sighing] Okay.
[sighs]
[whirring]
[electricity humming]
And we have a lock.
I don't understand.
If I'm The Flash, then why are you doing this to me?
Why do I have to catch this... this thing before you let me go back?
Please, look, I will do whatever you want.
Just let me go back right now, so I can help my friends.
Barry!
[electricity humming]
Barry, turn around!
[rumbling]
What is that?
What is that?
Those are your friends.
They want you to come back.
Can I?
Of course.
But if you do, it'll be without your powers.
Take my hand!
Do it. Take my hand.
[whoosh]
The choice is yours, Barry.
Barry!
[groans]
What is going on in here?
Just hang on a little longer, Ramon...
A little longer.
Hey, you're killing him!
Cisco!
Hey, Cisco, can you hear me?
[sighs]
I saw him.
Barry... he turned to me.
[sighs]
I'm sorry.
I lost him.
[melancholy music]
No.
[computer beeping]
Whoa, Cisco's meta-human alert app is going crazy.
Oh, Tony just trashed the hell out of Jitters.
[scoffs] Now, that is strange.
He knocks over a hydrant on 4th and Stevenson, doesn't go in the building, then smashes a Humvee in front of the Big Belly Burger, but doesn't go in the building.
Gets to CC Jitters... He actually goes in.
Yeah, it's like Jitters was his target, but why?
When I was in Iron Heights awaiting trial, I had a cellmate who always swore he was gonna break out.
At a pre-trial hearing, he stole a deputy's gun and escaped in a police cruiser.
There's a point to this, Joe, I promise.
Now, the poor, dumb b*st*rd could have gone anywhere, right?
But he was apprehended two hours later. Do you know why?
'Cause he went to his old girlfriend's house looking for her.
So you think that's what Tony's doing, even in the state he's in now?
I think people are creatures of habit, sometimes at a level stronger than conscious thought.
No, I don't think that Tony had a girlfriend.
I mean, not the way that he was hitting on me when he...
He came into Jitters.
He's after me again.
So, when he was after you the first time, where'd you see him next, after Jitters?
Home.
He came to our house when he took you.
Wally's there now.
No, no, Dad, this is good.
We know where he is, and we know what he wants.
That means we know how to beat him.
How do you propose we do that?
We use me as bait to lure him back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Cisco and Wells can kill him... again.
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
[panting]
Who are you pretending to be now?
I don't have time for this.
Yes, you do, Barry.
You have all the time in the universe... literally.
No, I don't.
And how can you stand there in judgment and accuse me of rejecting my gift?
Do you have any idea how much I've done since I was first struck by lightning, how many people I've helped with the power that you gave me... what I've sacrificed?
Of course we do.
You've saved countless lives.
[dramatic music]
And now you're the only thing standing in between your world and unspeakable evil.
And yet, for all of that, you've never been here.
I can't believe he's coming here.
Wally. Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Wait.
I've been meaning to ask you. Uh...
How are you feeling?
Tired, but fine, I guess.
So you don't notice anything different?
Uh, no.
I mean, I want you to know you can come and talk to me if you're scared or... you have questions about how your body's changing.
Oh.
I think you're a little late for the puberty talk, Dad.
I've seen the Internet.
[chuckles]
Looks like I'm gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way.
Are you okay?
[distant clatter]
[sirens wailing]
[Tony screaming]
Wally, go upstairs.
Please, go upstairs, now.
Dad, do you really think that he's a meta-human?
Well, he got zapped by the particle accelerator, and he was unconscious. It was worth a shot.
I gave you that mug.
He's coming.
[snarling]
[ominous music]
You sure about this?
You know what?
Two minutes ago, I would've said yes, absolutely.
But now... what the hell?
[door closes]
[snarling]
[whistling]
Tony! Hey!
Come on, over here.
[grunting]
You getting towards S.T.A.R. Labs?
On my way.
I'll meet you there.
Wally, stay here! I'll be right back!
Why did you bring me here?
Your mother's death happened to you, Barry.
It made who you are, but have you accepted it, really accepted losing her?
Maybe that's why you couldn't come here...
'cause that would make it real.
I know it's real.
Every day I know it.
I had a chance to save her.
You saw what I chose.
And you're at peace with that decision?
[scoffs]
"At peace""
[solemn music]
How could someone ever be at peace with letting his mother die...
Deciding that his life was more valuable than hers?
Do you really think your mother would've wanted you to die for her?
And out of all the people the Flash saved as a result of that decision, what about them?
Do their lives have value too?
[whooshing]
I don't have to listen to this.
I have to get home.
[dramatic music]
Cisco!
Is that zombie still behind you?
Good news is we lured Tony back to S.T.A.R. Labs.
Bad news is we lured Tony back to S.T.A.R. Labs.
No, no. This is good. Okay, sidenote...
You both might want to be on this side of the room, especially if you're wearing any jewelry or you have any metal plates in your body.
Huh?
Excuse me?
The stray energy from the accelerator reactivated Girder's brain... Well, parts of it, anyway.
So I disassembled our MRI machine to set up these...
Electromagnets. So, when Girder walks through that door and gets caught in the field that they generate, it should disrupt the energy wave that turned him Abby Normal.
Like wiping a hard drive.
Lah-kah-tah!
[grunting]
Okay, now, I can only maintain full power for a few seconds, so I can't actually turn this on until he's in the room.
[growling]
[intense music]
There he is. Hi!
[electricity humming]
[humming slows]
[panting]
Why don't it look like it's working?
Because it's not. Uh, let's get out of here.
This is the safest place for her for now.
[distant clatter]
Not safe enough.
Plans A through G did not work.
Do we have anything in here that can stop him?
Barry could stop him if we could bring him back.
We tried that already, Dr. Allen.
We need to try it again.
Somebody needs to try something. That door's not gonna hold.
[whoosh]
[solemn music]
[chuckles]
Mom.
Hi, Barry.
You're not my mother.
Why are you doing this to me?
We're not doing anything to you, sweetheart.
You're just so tired.
Sit, Barry. Sit.
You were right all along.
I haven't accepted it... not for a second.
I don't think I ever will.
My beautiful boy...
You have to find a way.
How?
I don't know.
But I know this.
What you've become... It's wonderful... a miracle even, but it won't make bad things stop happening to you.
Even the Flash can't outrun the tragedies the universe is gonna keep sending your way.
You have to accept that.
And then you can truly run free.
[voice breaking] I know.
I just miss her.
I miss you so much.
What if I told you that she's proud of you?
And of the man that you've become?
Who's telling me that... the Speed Force or my mother?
Both.
Is there any other way out of here?
No, the Breach Room was designed to be sealed off.
All right, look, if it's me that he wants, I'll just lead him away.
No, you won't.
You'll never even make it past that door.
If he came back from the dead and still wants you, what makes you think he's gonna let you go now?
Wait.
I saw Barry. He had this look.
What if we couldn't get him out of the Speed Force because he didn't want to come back?
Do you remember this book?
It was always your favorite.
"Once there was a little dinosaur called a Maiasaur, who lived with his mother. One day, he told his mother, 'I wish I were special like the other dinosaurs. If I were a T. rex, I could chomp with my ferocious teeth!' 'But if you were a T. rex,' said his mother, 'how would you hug me with your tiny little arms?'"
[chuckles]
"'I wish I were an Apatosaurus,' said the little dinosaur, 'so with my long neck I could see high above the treetops.' 'But if you were an Apatosaurus,' said his mother, 'how would you hear me in the treetops when I told you I love you? What makes you so special, little Maiasaur?' said his mother. 'Is it your ferocious teeth or long neck or pointy beak? What makes you special is out of all of the different dinosaurs in the big, wide world, you have the mother who is just right for you and who will always'"...
: "'Love you.'"
You're ready.
[whoosh]
[dramatic music]
[triumphant music]
Turn it on.
We got to try again.
Any of you got a better idea?
When you look into the Speed Force, can someone else see into it too?
Well, as long as you're in physical contact with Ramon while he's vibing, then... yes.
Let me do that.
I can get Barry to come back.
No.
Let me do it.
Please.
Iris...
[dramatic music]
[gasps]
Barry.
Barry, come home to me.
Run, Barry. Run.
Barry!
Barry!
Ha ha!
I'm so glad you're back, 'cause we're about to die.
Wait. What?
[banging on door]
So...
Girder.
Girder came back to life, and he's all Young Frankenstein now, and he only recognizes Iris, and she lured him to my workshop so we could demagnetize him, but the machine shorted out, so he's about to come through that door and smush us all into chunky salsa and possibly eat our brains out.
I don't know. Jury's still out on that.
All right, I got it.
I-I will lure him to your workshop, and we figure out a way to turn the power back on, okay?
: Plan H. [banging on door]
[grunts, screams]
[ominous music]
Hey, Tony!
He's taking him the long way. Come on!
I hope you're ready. He's almost here.
Nope, not ready.
Power needs at least two electromagnets...
Too much for this wiring to handle.
We're gonna need a really big extension cord!
All right, I'll... I'll see what I can do.
Ugh!
Barry!
[grunts] Tony, Tony... look, you were never my favorite person, but let's end this... so you can finally rest.
[heroic music]
He's using spin to charge the magnets.
Like an electric turbine.
[electricity crackling]
[yelling]
[panting]
Sorry... I got lost.
It's okay. We found you.
[chuckles]
[somber music]
[clears throat] Barry.
You should rest. You don't need to be here.
No, that's just it. I think I do.
[electricity crackles]
Hi.
[dramatic music]
How did I get here?
[chuckles]
How did you do that?
Are you, like, magic now?
Did you know that was gonna happen?
Maybe. It's hard to explain. It's...
It's the Speed Force.
[air hissing intermittently]
It's been quite a day, huh?
Not so much "one damn thing after another" as "every damn thing all at once".
It all worked out okay in the end.
No, you worked it out okay in the end.
It's funny. I never really understood where you were coming from with your whole "fate" and "everything happens for a reason" point of view.
But now...
I think that maybe I was wrong.
Everything that's happened to us...
Good and bad...
It made us who we are.
And I don't think that I would change it even if I could.
Does that make any sense?
Perfect sense.
And since we're on the subject of changing our minds about important things, you know that part where I told you I was gonna leave Central City so that you could be the Flash without being concerned about me all the time?
Forget all of that. You're stuck with me.
I'm not going anywhere.
[chuckles]
Joe offered to take me so many times.
I always found an excuse to say no.
[melancholy music]
My mom and I read this when I was little.
Do you know it?
Yeah. I-I never really liked that book.
Why?
Because it was about a mother who was always there for her child, no matter what, and that wasn't my mom... or yours.
We never had anyone who was "just right" for us.
Didn't we?
I'm seeing things a lot differently now.
I wasted so much time being angry about what I'd lost, when I had so much...
My dad, Joe, and you.
The truth is, Iris, I don't know what this is between us or where we go from here.
All I know is you're everything to me, and you always have been.
And the sound of your voice will always bring me home.
[upbeat music]
[ominous music]
Cait, please.
I asked you not to call me that.
Caitlin... we've been through this again and again, and we've gotten nowhere.
Now, I need to know... Are you with me, or are you against me?
Don't answer that yet.
I'm gonna go out there, spend a moment speaking to my friends, and when I come back, you'll give me your answer.
If you're still here, I'll know you've chosen to stay with me.
But if you're not here...
I'll know you've chosen your friends instead.
And I will show you exactly as much mercy as I will show them when we next see each other.
So there you have it.
[sighs]
I need to go.
[demonic voice] My brothers and sisters... my friends...
I've brought us to this new world which lay before us, defenseless, ours for the taking.
The humans think that this planet belongs to them.
Whose world is this?
: [chanting] Our world! Our world! Our world! Our world! Our world! Our world! Our world! Our world! Our world! Our world! Our world! Our world!
