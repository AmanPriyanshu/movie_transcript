[Music]
: That's me.
Okay, ramen, time to capture your beauty.
[Camera shutter clicks]
Perfect.
: Can I borrow that really fast?
Huh?
Fine, but give it right back, please.
I need to post that photo.
Yeah, yeah, man. I just got to check something.
Uh, ah-Ha-Ha! Yep!
He was replaced in the third movie.
See?
Ice Bear still right.
You just more right.
Ha ha!
[Splash] Grizz!
Don't worry!
[Slurps] See? Good as new.
[Scoffs] Gee, thanks.
Ice Bear wants more takoyaki.
Aah! Oof!
[Camera shutter clicks]
Hey! Not cool, dude!
: [humming]
What's this song called again?
Ugh! Stop, Grizz!
Just let me see it.
I downloaded the app hummit for just this reason.
Okay, okay, but be quick.
[Breathes deeply]
[Humming loudly]
[Groans]
[Beeps]
Ice Bear needs this.
[Camera shutter clicks]
Okay, just don't get it ...
Dude! Man, disgusting! What's your problem?!
What does a genie have to do with snakes?
You guys, just give me back my phone!
Ice Bear needs texting.
No, just stop!
I'm almost finished with my level!
Seriously, guys, this isn't funny any more!
Just give it back!
[Gasps]
It's okay. You're safe now.
That is it!
You are now banned from borrowing my phone forever!
Whoa. Easy, Panda. We're brothers.
We share everything. Well, not anymore!
I'm the one with the phone in this house.
It's my phone!
And I can't trust you two with it anymore! [Grumbles]
[Snoring]
[Muffled laughing]
Ugh. What are they doing up so early?
Oh, man, would you look ... [Laughs]
Oh, morning.
What are you guys laughing about?
Oh, hey, man! Guess what.
We got new phones!
Huh?
Well, we felt bad about yesterday, so we went out this morning and got ourselves the coolest new phones.
It's the newest model, and it has some crazy features.
Like it has a built-in extendable selfie stick.
[Camera shutter clicks]
It's also super-flexible and waterproof.
Pretty amazing, right?
Yeah, it's super-cool that you guys have really sweet phones.
It has these super-advanced security features, too.
Ice Bear will demonstrate.
Beginning retina scan.
So cool, dude.
And not only does it have a "find your phone" feature, 
We don't even know what that means!
Ah, isn't this great?
Yeah ... [chuckles] right.
Now ... now we all have one.
Y-You have your new, shiny, fancy ones.
I have my ... my old one.
Hey, guys, do you want to go to the mov...
[Both chuckle]
Are you guys texting each other or something?
Oh, we're not texting.
Well, what was that, then?
You mean that blob alert?
[Chuckles] No, it's not. See, I started a blob, and people can join and share funny things, like videos and photos.
: It's awesome.
Yeah, man, you should download it!
[Beeps]
[laughs]
Wha...? [Grumbles]
So, what's for dinner tonight, bros?
Um... guys? Hello?
Don't worry your hungry little tummy. I got this.
In 5, 4, 3, 2...
[Knock on door]
Hello! One extra large half meaty supreme for Mr. Grizzly.
That's me!
Wait.
How did he get here so fast? You just ordered!
It's this new app, "pizzanow" ... instant delivery.
Have a nice day, sir!
Pretty sweet, huh?
Aloha!
I have fresh, prepaid Hawaiian barbecue, straight from Maui.
Mahalo.
Have a nice day!
[Beeping]
I've lost my appetite. I'm gonna go outside for a while.
All right, man, have fun.
Got it!
Aah!
What just happened?!
New app!
See? [Laughs] Okay, I'm done now.
[Laughs] Okay, seriously, you can go now. 
Hello, sir.
Aah!
Do you need help finding something?
[Clears throat] Uh, yes, actually, I would like to upgrade my phone to the newest model, please.
Oh, you mean the Constellation X4000.
Yes! Yeah! That's the one that I want!
Unfortunately, we sold out of those this morning, but our generic version, the Comet X4000, is still available, but all trades are final.
What do you say, sir?
Yeah, let's do it.
Guys! Guys! Guess what.
Wha?
I got a new phone, too!
[Laughs] Check it out ... it's just like yours!
Now I can blop with you.
You mean blob?
Yeah, yeah...
No! No, no, no, no! How can this be?!
Here, let me see it. Hmm. [Sniffs]
Hmm.
What, what?
Bro?
Sorry, man. Your new phone's not legit.
It might even be worse than your old phone.
What happened to your old phone, anyway?
Gone...
Can you get it back?
Nope.
Bummer.
[Beeps]
Oh.
[Beeping, laughing]
But this seed has birthed entire civilizations.
[Muttering] King tut, king tut...
Egypt... pyramids built...
[Grumbles]
I've looked everywhere! Panda! Panda, get up! [yawns]
We've lost our phones! Are you awake?!
Are you lost, too?! Panda?!
I don't know what's going on!
We can't find our phones! We looked everywhere!
We even checked the pockets of that pair of pants we have!
Oh, no. What an unfortunate accident.
Gosh, have you checked under the couch?
Ah! The cushions!
That's where I look when I lose food and stuff!
[Breathes deeply]
The power...
Boy, I'm sorry, guys. You know what?
You can borrow my phone once in a while if you need, just like before.
Ah, it's just not the same.
Ice Bear gives up.
A pity. A tragedy, really.
I mean, I wish there was some way to find your phone.
Find your phone...
Huh?
"Phone finds you"!
Panda, you're brilliant!
"Phone finds you"?
This is great!
I'm not sure how this works.
Hey, y'all, wan... want to check out a game I downloaded on my phone?
[Beeping]
Yeah, that sounds good, actually.
We'll play.
Cool. Okay, here!
[Cellphones vibrating]
[Pinging]
Uh... I'm gonna go get something to drink.
I'll be right back.
[Sighs] Stop worrying about it, Pan.
"Phone finds you"... [chuckles] stupid.
[Vibrating, rattling]
Huh?
[Vibrating continues]
[Tapping]
Yes! [Coughing] Yes. Um, everything is fine!
[Tapping]
Wait, what you doing here, man?
Uh... I was just, um, sweeping. Just sweepin'!
Just sweep sweep. [Chuckles nervously]
Just thought I would, you know, clean up a bit since you guys have had a such a, you know, such a stressful day and all.
Thanks, man. That means a lot.
Ice Bear is touched.
No prob. Hey!
You guys should just go relax in the living room.
[Tapping]
You know what?
On second thought, let's go back to the kitchen.
Yeah, you guys are probably super hungry.
Yeah, I guess I could eat.
Making summer rolls might distract Ice Bear from pain.
Yes! Make those! [Chuckles nervously]
[Beeping, tapping]
[Whimpering]
Guilty!
[Vibrating loudly]
Aah! Shh! Shh! Shh!
Turn off, turn off, turn off, turn ...
Wait. What? Ow! My eyes!
[Buzzer]
Aah! Aah!
...I see no ketch...
Huh?
Hey, you okay?
Yes. [chuckles] It's all great.
Uh-huh.
Hold me, Panda.
Tell me it's gonna be okay.
Tell me we'll soon find our phones.
[Sniffles]
Wait. Where you going?
Huh?
Come sit with us. We can't be alone when we're sad.
Sit down.
O-kay.
By the way, I have your phone.
Um, okay. Just set it down.
[Vibrates]
Panda, please help yourself. Just pick one.
Okeydokey. [Chuckles]
Um...
Ah, let me just move your hand closer.
No!
Have dip.
[Coughs, chokes]
I-I'm innocent.
You make me sick! Confess!
[Cellphone vibrates]
Panda, you're trembling.
[Cellphone vibrates]
Are you sad for us?
[Cellphone vibrates]
You're sweating, you're shaking.
Everyone knows you did it. You can't get away with it.
Guilty, guilty, guilty!
Okay! Okay! Yes! Yes! A thousand times yes!
It was me!
Uh, I got to go outside. Okay, bye!
Wait! Panda! You forgot your phone!
Here you go.
Our phones! Panda?
What?
Is there a way to get these fixed?
Well, we can repair the cracked screens, but this?
We can't fix this. I'm sorry.
Oh, that's fine. I really don't deserve a phone anymore.
I'm really sorry about this, guys. I'll be outside.
[Door opens]
I'm a bad person. [Sniffles]
[Gasps] My phone!
We traded ours in for your old one.
We know your phone means a lot to you, Panpan, and we don't need our own.
Ice Bear prefers to be off grid.
I promise, from now on, I will always share whenever you want.
I don't deserve such a great fam...
Whoa. O-O-Okay. You need that?
