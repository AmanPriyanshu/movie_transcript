Are you having fun watching your book get made into movie?
It's not what I expected.
Take it up with the head of the studio.
Peri Westmore is twisting this movie into something I hate.
Why don't we have dinner tonight... talk about it.
I'm Daniela! Your cousin Josefina's daughter?
That girl's your daughter?
I was a just teenager.
So she doesn't even know she's adopted?
I want to divorce Adrian.
You seem so devoted to him.
Now that he's an invalid I can't, or everyone will think I'm a monster.
As long as I'm in this chair, she won't leave me, which is why I'm paying you to keep my little secret.
You had to make a choice between the life of a baby and my life, and you made the wrong one.
Fashion exec just bought this place.
She's gonna be gone for six months.
She needs a maid to help her unpack.
[Doorbell rings] Uh, a gift for the new homeowner.
I'm so glad I bought this house.
Six months ago, Spence suffered a traumatic brain injury.
Spence is remembering things again.
You called my sponsor?
Just talk to Ben.
Fine.
Now, where should we begin?
You should spend some time with Ben.
He really puts things in perspective.
You were right. Something weird's going on at that house.
Peri is tricking you.
You're out of your mind.
I remember.
I know the truth.
You're gonna pay for what you did!
Oh, my God.
Mrs. Genevieve?
Are you awake?
What?
What time is it?
6:00 A.M.
I know you said not to wake you till 7:00...

I must look a frightful mess.
Did you wear earrings to bed?
Oh. This is just my sleep jewelry.
Rosie, why am I awake right now?
I'm so sorry, but I've got wonderful news, and I had to tell somebody.
Well, lucky me.
When I woke up, I looked at my phone and there were 15 missed calls from Spence!
Dear, it's very early.
Is there a brief version of this story?
After I left the party last night, Spence remembered everything... how awful Peri was, how he fell in love with me.
That's terrific.
Listen.
[Cellphone beeps]
[

Is he drunk? He sounds drunk.
No, Spence doesn't drink. He must have been tired.
[Cellphone beeps]
Isn't that romantic?
I tried calling him back, but...
Yes, wonderful story.
Rosie, would you be a dove and bring me some coffee?
Coming right up!
Peri?
Santo Dios!
Now, now, that doesn't necessarily mean that he did it.
On the bright side, I guess he really would do anything to be with you.

Wait, what?
You're... you're moving here?

Well, I've been thinking.

I thought you would be happy.
Oh, I am!

It's just that, um, L.A. is

So?
I'm crashing here for free.
But you can not mooch off the Powells forever.
That's my gig.
And besides, you want to be a singer, you have to pay for studio time, for head shots, for... for hair, for makeup.
I know.
You don't even have a job.
No. No.
You have to go back to San Juan and... and save the money and...

What?
The Flowers.
They're so beautiful.
Roses, lilies, carnations.
No, this is not what I wanted.
Really? I like carnations.
I know. They get a bad rap, but...
Marisol, I'm sorry. I wasn't talking to you.
Oh.
Oh, well, anyway, uh, it's very thoughtful and romantic.

Sure.

After a day like this, it would be really nice to see you.
Wh... you didn't hear about Peri?
Oh, God. What's she done now?
She was murdered.
What?!
Peri Westmore's dead.
So is your film.
I am so sorry, Mrs. Genevieve, but can you watch Miguel?
I would never ask, but I need to see Spence because of... thing.
Peri's gruesome murder?
Yes.
And please no TV for Miguel.
I don't want him to know what happened.
Of course.
Not a word about Spence being the likely killer.
Mm-hmm.
Oye, Miguel, be a good boy for Mrs. Genevieve.
I'll be back later, hmm?
Oh, my God.
Peter.
Who's Peter?
My husband.
Well, ex-husband.
You were married to that guy?
Oh, yes.
Husband number three... the youngest man I ever married.
Just look at him.
Every bit as handsome as he was on our wedding day.
I know I have a picture somewhere.
My mom's only been married twice.
Oh, well, give her time.
Maybe this is a sign that Peter and I should get back together.
I always wondered if our age difference was a problem.
You see, back then, Peter was in his late 20s and I was in my early 40s, but now he must be at least 50, and I'm still in my 40s.
Wait, how can you still be in your...
Nobody likes a mathematician, sweetie.
Ah, here it is.
Oh, look at us.
So in love.
Miguel, we're going on a field trip.
Fetch me my Jimmy Choos.
I'm 10.
I don't know what that is.
Ah, the sparkly heels with the pointy toes.
Okay.
Peter Hudson, the one who got away.
I can't believe this thing with Spence.
Have you talked to Rosie?
Yeah.
She wants to meet at the café to talk.
Why can't we have coffee here?
I mean, you're getting paid to live at a fancy house with no boss.
Let's get some of the perks.
[Chuckles] [Doorbell rings]
I have to get that.
Just stay here.
Hi.
Hey.
Sorry to keep popping by unannounced.
Can I come in?
I have a friend over, and she's shy.
Maybe later?
I have an extra ticket to the polo match.
Please tell me you're a polo fan.
I... adore polo.
My friends are constantly saying, "Zoila, stop talking about polo."
[Chuckles] Great. I'll come by at 4:00.
I can't wait.
See you later.
[Quiet chuckling]
[Gasps]
What was that?
Nothing.
Rich neighbors don't invite maids to polo matches, unless... you're gonna clean the horse poo!
No! No, no, no.
Um, the other day, I was drinking and trying on the owner's gowns, which wasn't as weird as it sounds now.
Um, anyway, this really cute guy came over and assumed I owned the house, so I... just went with it.
Are you kidding me?
I know. It was a mistake.
I have to tell him the truth.
No!
That's the best thing you've ever done!
You have to keep lying.
I actually like you for once.
Okay, so I was thinking about this fabric for the drapes.
What do you think?
Vertical stripes for the windows?
Like a prison?
A simple "no" would have sufficed.
What's with you today?
It's Adrian.
Doctor said he'll never walk again.
I am so sorry.
All I want is to be free of this marriage.
Now because Adrian's too stupid to get out of the way of a falling ceiling beam, I'm stuck.

Hypothetically, say there was a tragedy and someone's husband was severely injured.
I'm with you.
How soon after could this woman divorce...
Never.
But wait.
What if she made a charitable donation?
No.
Even if the charity was the inner city... children's... animal?
No!
If you divorce Adrian now that he's disabled, everyone at the club will crucify you!
Unless...
What?
Unless Adrian did something terrible to you.
You know, like had an affair.
But obviously that's not possible anymore?
Oh, it's possible.
Oh, so he didn't lose the use of everything below the waist?
God, no. You couldn't kill that man's pen1s with a stick.
I know. I tried once.
Okay.
Well, if he did have an affair, you'd be the victim, and nobody would fault you for leaving.

[Chuckles]
It was a mistake not to read it, and I'm sorry.
You're forgiven.
Good.
Hmm.
Because I think there's something between us.
I don't know what it is yet, but I really want to find out.
Don't you?
Oh, and that's our last night.
The hotel had a big party for all the guests.
Kyle and I were the only ones there who weren't a couple.
You don't say.
Kyle, honey, why don't you go start the dishes, and Zoila and I will clean up in here?
Oh, sure thing.
Okay, spill it.
What?
You think this is totally weird.
No. No!
Liar.
I know we're probably too close, but it's all me.
I mean, Kyle just wants me to be happy, so he indulges me.
Kyle's a good man.
"Man."
That's still funny to me.
I'll always think of him as my miracle baby.
I had a whole handful of miscarriages before I had him.
It was an awful time.
It was this cloud of loss hanging over me.
I'm so sorry.
Well, it's all right.
I had Kyle, and it was all sunshine.
Are you okay?
Well, let's just say I understand.
Come here.
What did you do that for?
You looked like you needed it.
And I'm right next door if you need another one.
Or a cookie. I sometimes have those.
[Chuckles]
Thank you.
Oh, I didn't realize how late it was.
It's time for Kyle's bath.
Gotcha.
[Laughs]
Don't you ever knock?
You tried to seduce Mr. Powell?!
What were you thinking?
I was following your advice.
My advice?
You said always blackmail for something good, so I made a deal.
I seduce Mrs. Powell's husband and she introduces me to a music producer.
Wait.
Mrs. Powell knows a music producer?
Yep, and now I will, too.
Relax, Carmen. Nothing happened.
But what if Mr. Powell said yes?
You were gonna sleep with him?
You're just mad Big Red asked me instead of you.
If she asked me, I would have said no.
Hmm.
Maybe that's why you're still a maid.
[Scoffs]
Well, this is a surprise.
Steven, this is my wife, Evelyn.
This is Steven, our new accountant.
He's never been to the club before...
You troll.
She was never very good with terms of endearment.
What kind of game are you playing here, Adrian?
My dear, I have no idea what you're talking about.
The only reason I've been staying with you is because I didn't want people to think I was a monster for divorcing a cripple!
[Gasps]
Yes!
You are right to gasp, because you actually are a cripple.
This man is only pretending to be a cripple!
Perhaps you should stop saying "cripple."
Get out of that chair!
But I can't!
Uh, Evelyn, have you lost your mind?
You said if he did something horrible, I could divorce him!
Did he cheat on you?
Worse... He can walk!
Please! Don't hurt me!
Get your lousy ass out of this chair!
[Shouts]
[Crowd gasps]
You're a monster.
No, I am not a monster!
I am the victim!
Gail, tell them that I'm not a monster!
Gail, Gail!
She's a monster.
I had a lovely time tonight.
Are you sure?
[Chuckles]
I know my mother and I are a little close.
I get it if you want to run away screaming.
Your mother's great.
I can see why you want to spend time with her.
♪♪
See you soon?
You know where I live.
[Door opens, closes]
You like her, don't you?
Yeah, I really do.
I like her, too... a lot.
[Chuckles]
But not for you.
I have other plans for you, Kyle.
[Door closes]
Mrs. Delatour, Marisol Suarez to see you.
Oh.
How lovely of you to stop by.
That will be all, Miguel.
Why is Rosie's son answering your front door?
I've taken him under my wing.
Turns out he has great potential.
And he's an excellent driver.
Would you like to sit?
No. No, I'm not staying.
I just wanted to let you know that I've thought about the situation with Peter.
I knew you'd come around.
I'm not breaking up with him.
He's great, and I think I owe it to myself to see where it goes.
Oh, I see.
Well, I appreciate your telling me that in person.
I really don't want to hurt you, but I just felt it best to be up front and honest.
Of course.
And I suppose it was a lot of me to ask of you anyway.
[Sighs]
So, you understand?
I do. Completely.
Thank you.
It's such a relief.
Marisol?
Just one more thing.
This means war.
Well, I'm not sure what got into you this evening, but if you feel like discussing it...
For God's sake, Adrian.
Give it up. I know you can walk.
I have it all on video.
Ah.
That's why Daniela tried to seduce me.
You set me up.
Very clever.
Now that everyone thinks I'm a monster anyway, I'm leaving you.
Evelyn, we were meant to be together.
I was willing to stay in that chair forever to keep you.
Look at the lengths you went to entrap me.
There was a time when that sort of cat-and-mouse excited me, but now I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of you!
But we're both so deliciously twisted.
You're the only person who can match me blow for blow.
Well, I'm sorry, Adrian, but from now on, you'll just have to blow yourself.
Detective? I need to talk to you.
I can prove Spence is innocent.
You can?
He was at a club at the time that Peri was killed.
I have a witness. Her name is Cinnamon.
She's a stripper who works there.
Uh-huh.
That's her name and number.
You've got to question her.
And how did you get this stripper to say what you needed her to say?
Did you give her money?
No!
Well, yes, for a lap dance.
I see.
Well, ma'am, this case is closed.
We've already got a confession.
What?
Spence just confessed.
We're taking his statement right now.
I was furious 'cause Peri lied to me for months.
I couldn't let her get away with it.
So what did you do?
I killed her.
I killed Peri.
