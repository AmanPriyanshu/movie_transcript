: Dear Ashley, how would you feel about a real-life submissive experience with me as your guide?
You can't disobey me, Ashley.
End it or I'm done.
She wants the romance novel.
Well, then she's reading the wrong book.
I don't want you here.
This is your punishment, remember?
: Well, when do I get a reward?
When you start doing exactly as I say.
I'm just waiting for you to tell me what to do next, master.

Okay, now I'm nervous.
Why?
We're not going to do that, are we?

What the hell is wrong with you?
Ashley told me what you said.
What did I say?
About how Tomas has been so important for your career.
Because he has.
About how it's all so f*cking complicated.
Because it is, which is why I need time.
You've had more than enough time.
I'm ripping off the f*cking Band-Aid, Scarlet.
Jules. No.
I've waited eight months, and that's my limit.
If you want to spend the rest of your life in a dead-end relationship, then you go right ahead.

Maybe there's a way we can fix this.

So what would you guys say if I told you I was going to start practicing polyfidelity?
Is that a religion?
No, it's like polyamory, but with monogamy.
Wait. What's polyamory?
Okay, so it's like this.
I'm in love with a married woman, and for the last eight months, I've been nagging her to define her relationship by conventional standards when I f*cking hate convention.
Convention's overrated.
Exactly. Vanilla relationships equal vanilla s*x.
You probably know this better than anybody.
Well, I'm working on changing that.
With who?
Dude, don't get sidetracked.
It's nobody you know.
Wait. So there is somebody?
No, there's nobody.
I just mean I'm opening myself up a bit more.
Oh, like with the spanking thing.
Jules. She made me spank her.
How unconventional.
But getting back to the whole Scarlet thing, what I've come to realize over the last few days is that there is a way for our relationship to work, and that way is polyfidelity.
You still haven't told us what that is.
Why don't you just find someone who's actually available?
That's the thing. Scarlet is available.
Yeah, to her husband, not you.
Yeah, but she can be available to me when I come to accept and embrace the choices that she's made.
And by "accept the choices," you mean accept the marriage.
Yeah. And by "embrace the choices," I mean, I'm going to start f*cking both of them.
