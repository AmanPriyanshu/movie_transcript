Wow! Wasn't that the most amazing movie you've ever seen?
Eh, a bunch of kids getting accidentally launched into space?
That's asking a lot of the audience.
It wasn't an accident.
A small boy befriends a robot who gets a NASA computer to launch them into orbit.
It's based on a true story.
Yeah, you said the same thing about "Mannequin" 
 "Weekend at Bernie's."
Fine! I believe in the magic of movies!
Doesn't change the fact that I'm gonna go to the real Space Camp someday.
Well, if I were you, I'd go now, before it's too late.
What do you mean, too late?
We're in high school next year, bro.
Stuff like Space Camp doesn't exactly scream "cool."
No! You think?
Your dorkiness is becoming a tonnage issue, so, yeah, I'd rein it in.
Then it's settled!
This summer, I will live out my dream at Space Camp, and nothing's gonna stop me.
Nothing except your dad, who will for sure stop you.
Oh, he'll try, but I got the ultimate weapon...
Showmanship.

Don't twist my words!
I just want access to one.

He'll know if Dad had any hopes and dreams.

You're a braver man than I am.
For me, fear isn't an option.
Excuse me, sir. You left this bag in the dressing room.

No way! I use that in the carpool lane.

How much is a lot? $200?
Are you trying to shake down your own grandchild?
He looks like he eats good.
It's a small price to pay to give Dad his dream so I can get mine.
Fine. I'll take care of it.
That was a discount price for the kid.
For you, it's $300.
