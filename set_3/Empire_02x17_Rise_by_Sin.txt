 Empire...
: 
: 
Freda, did you say something about Frank Gathers?
Yeah, that's my father.
The Lyon family will be performing at this year's ASA awards.
 you know D-Major, musical director 
: 
: 
And because you're not out.
You know I don't want to make you do anything you don't feel comfortable with.
Tiana's doing a duet with you on a song you yourself told me would go platinum.
The producers wanted her.
I bet you never even brought me up.
If it was me, I'd be jealous.
If my sister had everything and I had nothing.
: 
Carol.
So, what, you working for the NYPD?
No, I quit the force a long time ago.
: 
This is Leah Walker, Lucious' mother.
: 
 and there is nothing to fear.
I'm sorry I was too weak to kill you when I had the chance.
Now, tomorrow's the ASAs, and this song has to be the highlight of the show.
I want the entire world talking about it, okay?
Bring us in.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, you're too tentative on the entrance.
You know what? Start again.
(DRUMMER PLAYS INTRO)
(BAND JOINS IN)
Stop. Remember it's a lullaby. Look, we're gonna be here all night until you get this right.
Okay, start one more time.
Two, three, four.
(BAND PLAYING)
No, no.
I want the strings to come in just like that.
Let's try that again.
That chord, uh...
(LUCIOUS VOCALIZING WITH PIANO)
No, tired is not an option.
Get it together.
Bring me back in one more time.
Stop for a second. Just give me... g-give me drums and give me bass.
That pace... that's where we need to be at.
Stop. We're getting there.
We're getting there.
Bring me back in.
Make sure it's strong.
There's no room for error.
Yeah.
This is the ASAs.
(LUCIOUS VOCALIZING)
I like that, keep going.
(LUCIOUS VOCALIZING)
Take us there.
Yeah.
Bass, yeah, keep going.
I'm liking this a lot.
Yeah.
(BAND PLAYS HARMONIOUSLY)
Give me a couple minutes here.
Yes.
You guys sound amazing.
Band sounds great, Lucious.
Thanks, Cook.
They're getting there. What's up?
How's your mama?
She's still crazy.
She's still at your house, right?
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
What's up?
Um, Lucious, look, I need you to get some rest.
You've been at this all night.
Give the band a break.
I'll rest when I'm dead, but right now we got the ASAs tomorrow, and they got to be airtight.
You know that this ain't about the ASAs.
This is about you avoiding your mother.
Why you letting that woman do this to you?
Look, stay in your lane, Cookie.
Hey, Lucious, come here.
Lucious... you're working yourself so hard so you can avoid.
You have to deal with this.
Look, you didn't go home last night.
The other night you stayed in your office.
I told you, the woman's dangerous, and I don't trust her.
All right?
Can I get back to work, please?
All right, Lucious.
All right, count us back in, sweetheart.
: We are one day away from the 54th Annual American Sound Awards.
The big question everybody is asking: which Lyon will come...
: Tomorrow night on Fox, the 54th...
: The rain is supposed to clear up for tomorrow, so it should be...
Ms. Walker.
Toast, ham, scrambled eggs, everything you like.
No. Seasoning.
Pardon me?
You don't season your food.

: In the video for his nominated hit song, "Boom Boom Boom Boom,"
Lucious Lyon shares a heartbreaking story about his bipolar mother who took her own life.
It's a rare look inside one man's very personal journey through pain and poverty.
Lucious Lyon's own journey this year has been remarkable, having served three months in prison for what many consider a racially motivated prosecution, and then losing and regaining control of his Empire Entertainment, only to emerge with...
Boom.
...one of the biggest hits of his career.

Okay.
Hey, Cook, look, Rhonda just fit me in this dress.
It's banging, right?
So what do you think about me wearing it to the ASAs?
Thanks. Sure, but not if you're going with me.
You need to tell Rhonda to get you something a little more appropriate.
You look like a cheap prostitute.
So what skank you think Lucious is taking?
Girl, I don't know, and I don't care.
All I care about is getting those boys up on that stage, because come Sunday, all the headlines are gonna be calling us "The First Family of Hip Hop," and that is all I care about.
Girl, guess who I ran into at the restaurant on Great Jones Street.
Tariq Cousins, remember him?
Fine-ass Tariq?
Tariq the Freak?
Yeah.
The cop?
No, no... he's not working for the Philly PD anymore.
He lives here in New York.
(PHONE CHIMES)
Girl... he just invited me to dinner at Laviticus.
Ooh, you know, I'm gonna ask Rhonda if I could borrow this dress just in case Tariq wants to freak!
Yes, Tariq!

Oh, no, no, no, no, the two of y'all did that.

J... it's time to let your mom go.
You ain't serious?
I'm dead-ass.
Hell no, Derek.
That's my mother, and-and besides, I love working with her.
She's producing the whole damn 
 album.
Jamal... you're so much bigger than whatever your moms and pops could do for your sound right now.
Plus they keep you twisted up.
It's time for you to be more than a musical mama's boy.
You should level up.
Let me produce your next album.
You want to produce my next album?
Yeah.
Unless I ain't big enough for you.
Party with disguises.
Ten letters.

(CHUCKLES)
So, you good, Grandma?
Are you eating right?
You taking your medication?
So many pills, make me choke.
Why can't they put it all in one?
But you feel better, right?
Do the staff take you out to get some fresh air?
So many maids and people working in this house, it feels like 
But everybody treats you respectfully, right?
I don't like being left out.
Left out, how?
They talk about it on the TV, and I know Dwight's gonna be in it.
You talking about the ASAs?
They said my whole family's performing, but nobody invited me.
Do you know I've never even seen him on a stage?
Lucious Lyon.
Look, I'd-I'd love to take you to the ASAs, Grandma.
I'd need to talk to Empire's PR department to see if we can even get an extra ticket.
Tell Dwight to talk to them.
He can get me a ticket.
(SIGHS) You'd need a new dress... and I would have to run it by Pop. It could be a tricky situation.
Because he wishes I was dead.
Grandma, he doesn't wish that you were...
That's what he told everybody in that movie he made.
That was just a movie.
Okay, it was a story, make-believe.
Now, the problem...
I won't tell anybody he lied, if that's what you're scared of.
I just want to see my grandbabies up there on that stage, that's all.
It would destroy his credibility if anybody found out, Grandma.
It'd be bad for Empire, and it would be really, really bad for Pop.
Honey, there's gonna be so many pretty girls there, nobody's even gonna look sideways at a little old lady.
Hey, Rhonda.
Hey.
Oh, hey.
Sorry, do you have a minute?
Well, I'm on my way to a fitting for a bunch of artists for the ASAs, uh, well...
I'll meet you guys there, just go ahead without me.
Sure.
Hey, sorry.
Sorry, I barely have a minute.
What's up?
Um...
You weren't at yoga the other day and, uh, I thought I'd see you there, and I've been texting you, and it's just not like you to not respond, so...
I've just been crazed dressing all these artists, that's all.
Oh, okay.
Oh.
Oh, my God, I'm starting to show, and it's painful for you, I'm sorry, Rhonda.
No.
I'm so stupid.
No, no, Anika.
I should be more sensitive.
I'm fine, honestly.
I'm happy for you.
But I was gonna ask you a question, actually.
Do you remember when you came over that day to see the nursery and... you were wearing those really cute shoes?
They had red soles.
They were Louboutins, right?
Oh, God, I don't remember what I was wearing.
(LAUGHING): Why?
Just because I feel like they're good day-to-night shoes, so I was wondering if you were wearing them that night.
Were you?
Did we see each other that night?
I don't know.
Did we?
: 
 think a winter wonderland.
Snow... icicles, an all silver cake.
That's gonna be shiny.
All the mags are already scrambling to get the first pictures of the bride and groom.
Look, I don't even know if I want paparazzi at our wedding.

Carol's story panned out.
Tariq quit the force in 2010.
Why?
Don't know, files are sealed.
Some kind of police policy.
Even Thirst couldn't open it up, which means...
Which means he's a Fed now.
That's what it means.
Yeah, but this is the problem, now, I mean, why would the Feds want to rumble with me again, especially after that little fiasco with Roxanne Ford?
Now your boy, Tariq, I mean, I ain't never hung with him, but he was always respectful back when we was grinding, but him and your sister, that's...
Exactly, why would he want to get mixed up with Carol?
Everybody know Carol's a crackhead... and she got three illegitimate kids.
That don't make sense.
They not slick.
Thirsty might be done investigating Tariq, but I'm not.
Speaking about crackheads, why are you taking her to the ASAs?
Yeah, well, I heard you was gonna ask me until you found out I had a date.
No, that's all right, I'm-a take a supermodel.
Oh, Lucious, don't nobody want your fat ass.
Yeah, I'm only fat where it counts.

I'm not as gullible as my sister.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Uh-huh.
Ooh, uh, FYI, she doesn't know I'm here.
Uh-huh.
Carol, she always late.
Yeah.
I remember you bailing her out of a bunch of jams.
Yeah, family, that's what you do.
Of course, you stole a bunch of her boyfriends, too, and didn't she even hook up with, uh, Lucious before y'all hooked up?
See, that's not quite how that happened, Tariq the Freak.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
The Freak.
Look, I know you a Fed, so you better not be planning on putting the squeeze on my sister to try to come for me or my family.
You got something to hide?
(LAUGHS)
It's an innocent date.
I ran into her and wanted to hang, you know.
Hmm.
New York is colder than a pimp's heart on $65K a year.
Mm.
I miss Philly.
Yeah, we always said you was one of the good ones.
Yeah, you never forgot the "G" code.
Nah, never that.
I grew up on those streets, Cookie.
That code means more to me than any badge I wear, any oath of office I take... which is why I'm surprised you still rocking with Lucious when he's the one who violated it.
Lucious?
Yeah.
Yeah, he killed your cousin, Bunkie.
You enjoy your dinner at my and Lucious' club.
Oh, and watch out.
My sister has herpes.
Hope it's not too late.
(GRUNTS)
: 
What will your favorite star be wearing?
Who will be best dressed, worst, and most importantly, who will they be posing with?
Stay tuned.
: Tonight's gonna be a madhouse.
Okay, so you handle Jamal 'cause he's got to get the most press out of this, uh...
Steve, can y'all excuse me for a second?
So, did you have fun with Tariq last night?
As a matter of fact, I did, and he told me you came to say hey.
Why don't you just back off, Cookie?
Tariq's interested in me, not you.
What did you tell him?
What do you think, I'm stupid?
(CHUCKLES)
He's not investigating anybody.
Oh, he's not?
No.
Okay.
No, we just talked.
All we did was talk.
Oh, well, what did y'all talk about?
He told me that Raheem had to get his leg cut off from the knee down.
Raheem, really?
Really?
He is working you, stupid.
No, he is not!
(SIGHS)
You know, it is possible for a good man to like me, Cookie, and this time, you're not gonna steal him or try to poison him in my head.
Come here.
Come here. Come over here and talk to me.
Sit down, you're all the way over there.
You're all tense.
You had a drink last night with Tariq, didn't you?
Man, I told you, if you fall off again, that your ass was out, and I meant that!
You know you always stealing my boyfriends, right?
You stole Sean, then Kyle, yeah... Lucious.
Right... right, 'cause... if I'd never showed up, Lucious would have ended up with you.
Yeah, well, he met me first, then here you come.
Here come Cookie.
Every time you fall off the wagon, I get the blame.
I'm sick of it, Carol.
You really believe that you deserve my life.
Your sick ass really believe that.
Candace was right about you.
Candace.
Yeah, she was so right about you.
You don't give a damn about me.
All you care about is making yourself feel better.
That's why you keep me around.
You ain't got nothing of your own, just what Lucious is letting you have.
That's how you feel?
Yeah, that's how it is.
Okay... well, then bounce, Carol.
Bounce your ass out of my company.
That's how you feel?
I don't care about you?!
Then get your raggedy stuff out of my apartment!
That's what you can do since I don't care about you, and you know what, forget about the ASAs!
'Cause I'm not taking no washed up crackhead to no ASAs!
'Cause you ain't gonna embarrass me.
Get out!
I don't care about you.
I said get out!
Get out!
I don't care about you.

Bro, don't you ever come at me like that again, bro.

Yo, Lucious, this your son?
Yo, you need to talk to him.
'Cause this ain't cool.
(LAUGHS)
I see D-Major's still on the DL.
Must've got to you.
You knew?
A real dog can always tell a fake bitch.
Dad, can you stop with all the stupid riddles.
How did you know?
I've been in this business so long, you think I don't know a little bit about everybody in this industry?
And even though D-Major's a talented producer, his secret life is not so secretive.
And everybody knows how he likes to turn rich boys into his little bitch.
How do you know I ain't turning him into my little bitch?
He came on to me. I didn't come on to him.
Exactly.
I bet you he's on top.
You're disgusting, Dad.
No.
What's disgusting is what you're doing in my studio.
Anybody could've walked in here and saw you, and I taught you better than that.
You don't crap where you eat.
Yeah, Dad, you're right. You're enjoying this.
Enjoying what?
You think I enjoy watching my son become some closet phony's little bitch?
Look, man, I've tried to be sensitive to your way of life.
There it is. S-Sensitive to-to my way of life.
I've listened to you.
I've tried to tolerate something that is intolerable to my nature.
I tried to understand and be respectful of your choices, but you don't respect me.
You just keep throwing this unnatural way of life into my face.
I've tried to talk to you as a man, but all you do is turn into some little girl, mad about something I did to you 20 years ago.
20 years ago.
You're crying like a little bitch about your mother throwing you in some water 40 years ago, so what does that say about you?
Can't even look the woman in the eyes without crying.
I'm not crying.
Always telling me, "Jamal, don't be a little sissy bitch. Put it into music."
Well, Lucious, don't be a sissy bitch. Put it into mu...
You ain't nothing to me but a disappointment.
And the day you die from AIDS...
...I'm gonna celebrate.
Right when you think that Lucious can't stoop any lower, he does, every single time.
Okay, what did he do?
So I'm in the studio with D-Major, 'cause he wants to produce me and Freda.
And then Lucious...
Wh-Wh-What did you just say?
Mom, I told him no, okay?
But at this point, I should work with more producers.
Okay, so you're back working with Freda?
Why is 
 important? That's not even the issue.
Jamal, come on.
Lucious comes into the studio...
No, no, no, no, you need to let Freda go, Jamal.
No, Ma. Mom, no.
You got to let her go.
This is not about Freda. This is about Lucious.
This is about me.
And the things that we said that you can't come back from.
Hey, hey, hey. (SIGHS)
You remember that prosecutor who was so hell-bent on trying to bring your father down?
Yeah, um, Tits McGee.
Yeah, that bitch.
Well, the Feds are still coming for us.
Okay?
So we need to lay low, all right?
Be easy. Be careful. All of us.
We need to lay low? All of us?
Nah, they're coming for Lucious.
And tell me why I should care about that.
I got to worry about what's wrong with him and my music.
What would be my incentive to let go of my music for him?
(SIGHS)
You ever wonder how I got out early on good behavior?
Honestly, I-I assumed you informed on somebody, but I...
His name...
His name...
(GUNSHOTS)
Did you see who shot him?
Frank Gathers.
Ma, you snitched on Freda's dad?
Yeah, I snitched.
So what? I snitched.
I snitched.
That was the only damn time I ever snitched.
And he ends up on... in lock-up with our father.
Ma, did Lucious have something to do with his murder?
That was a very dangerous man, okay?
He would've killed all of us, without batting an eye.
And Freda?
You know that apple didn't fall far from the tree.
So I need you to let her go, Jamal.
It's dangerous.
For all of us, okay?
Okay.
Grandma?
Hey, ready to go?
We're going to the show.
Yes, ma'am, but we have to leave right now, before my father comes home to get dressed.
All right, Rhonda picked out a beautiful gown for you.
You can get dressed backstage in the greenroom, okay?
Let's go.
Dwight doesn't want me there?
Oh, n-n-n-no, he's just...
He's very nervous, that's all.
It's a big night for him.
Going somewhere?
I'm gonna need your phone.
A woman that beautiful shouldn't walk the red carpet alone.
You want my arm to fall off?
(LAUGHS) Shut up, Billy Dee.
I heard somebody needed a date for the ASAs.
Yeah, well, you know, Carol's back drinking again, so...
Well, Carol's more of a plus one.
Not a date.
(LAUGHS)
Baby?
Hmm?
I got you something.
What is that?
A joke?
Open it.
Is this a trick?
Open it.
(SCREAMS)
Oh, my...
(CHUCKLES)
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Ooh.
Let me put it on you.
This must have been as much as a sports car, huh?
A little more than a Ferrari but less than a Lamborghini.
Oh, my.
Look at that.
Yeah, the way I see it, tonight is our night, Cook.
I mean, this is what we dreamed about way back when we were selling CDs out of the back of that old hooptie in Philly.
Among other things we were selling.
I knew we'd get here, I just didn't know it was gonna take us this long.
: 
Yeah, I kind of like the little riff, but the, um...
...lyrics suck.
Lucious.
The song is about a man who's in love with a woman who don't love him back.
I swear, I couldn't imagine going with anyone but you.
(CHUCKLES)
: 
 this album... is gonna be big.
I can feel it.
 to duct-tape the driver's side of the door so you wouldn't fall out?
Oh, we was so raggedy back then.
Yeah, and you'd talk about what you wanted to wear and what you were gonna say.
And you told me I couldn't say nothing on the red carpet 'cause I would just sound stupid, so you was going to do the talking.
You was always saying stupid stuff back then.
Ain't nothing changed, really.
(BOTH LAUGH)
So, is that why you're taking me?
That and... I really miss that booty of yours.
Mm-hmm, I know you do.
I know you're looking at it while I'm walking away.
I'm trying not to.
(BOTH LAUGH)
You're such a flirt.
: 
(GRUNTS)
What the hell are you doing?
Just following the boss man's orders.
No disrespect, Andre.
You, too, Granny.
Come on. Get 'em in there.
Hey, at least you got a TV in there.
Daddy wanted you to be able to watch the ASAs.
: For 54 years, the American Sound Awards Enjoy the show. have defined excellence in music...
Every year the world's favorite musicians and artists come together to shine and be a part of New York City's most anticipated night of the year.

I'm so glad that my life story is inspiring others.
And if the pain and despair that I suffered after losing my mother to mental illness... if it helps one young boy feel less alone in this world, then it's all worth it.
Does he look fat?
The TV adds ten pounds, plus he broke his diet.
Why does he have a room like this?
To lock people up?
It's a panic room, Grandma.
Security company installed it.
Music gave me the strength to keep going after my mother passed away, and I believe...
He promised he wouldn't lock me up again.
They should all know he's a liar and a promise-breaker.
Listen to him tell his lies out there.
And so I'm dedicating tonight to my mother.
Thank you.

Okay, let me get this straight.
First, you two run Empire together, and now you two are on the red carpet tonight.
Ugh.
So, does this mean Cookie and Lucious Lyon are...?

Yeah, hood rat.
Your daddy.

We should still press her.
I don't want to do that to her, and besides, I don't need her.
What happened tonight at the ASAs, that wasn't random.
It touches right on the nerve of what I've been building on.
Bodies were dropping under Lucious Lyon 20 years ago.
Bunkie Campbell told someone he murdered four drug dealers.
Are you gonna bring me something big?
Always, but you know how I like to work.
I like to put things together carefully.
Lucious Lyon's ex-fiancé, pregnant by his son, Hakeem.
And she's willing to talk?
Not yet, but I'm planning to persuade her.

Anybody want coffee?
I'll take one.
I'll go with you.

Huh?

Damn, Cookie.
If you heard the things I said to Jamal.
Maybe it would've been better if my mama had drowned me.
Stop.
You were born into a living hell.
That you can't help.
But I know, deep down, you want to do what's right for your family.
I know it.
Mr. and Mrs. Lyon?
(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)
(SIREN WAILING)
Some are saying tonight's incident is more proof that hip-hop culture breeds violence.
But now, could Jamal Lyon end up paying for it with his life?
...citing privacy concerns, but we'll remain on the scene...
...by Freda Gathers, seems to be a message...
: Look! Someone just came outside.
: Who is she?
: Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.
