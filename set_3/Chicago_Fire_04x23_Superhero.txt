Hey, Chief.
Do you really need these by end of shift, or can we think on them some?
On my third shift as candidate on Truck, we lost Mikey Philo in the Superior fire.
We all got back to the house, pulled off our turnout gear, put on our work boots.
Mikey's boots had just stood untouched for a month That was a reminder.
These are about having no regrets.
So... end of shift, please.
It was tougher than I expected.
Yeah, well, it's a tradition worth bringing back.

Okay...

I'm looking at an apartment as soon as shift's over that's be perfect for us.
Give me three, four days tops, and I'll be ready for a home inspection.

Move back in with me.

The State Appropriations Committee is holding a three-day summit to discuss public safety issues, and you are now an official invitee.
And somehow this is good news?
Yes, because the Director of Emergency Management will be there, and getting real face time with him is crucial if you want to make inroads in updating Chicago's 911 system.
She's not wrong. It would go a long way.
I already booked a pair of rooms with stunning parking lot views at the Springfield Marriott.
The neighborhood's safe, and the folks in 4B have two little ones of their own.
It's perfect.
