Oh, shoot.
Guys, I gotta go finish some reports for work.
: Honey, are you eating something?
No, I'm doing work reports.
(loud crunching)
Mommy?
Mommy's busy!

Susan.
You left in the middle of the meeting.
Is everything okay?
Yep. Just silently pooping.
♪♪
Hi there, Amy.
How are you today?
Good.
Okay, so I am just gonna give you a quick breast exam.
Go ahead and lay back and relax.
Okay.
So, have you had any new sexual partners since the last time I saw you?
Oh, nnn...
What do you consider s*x? Penetration or...?
Well, no, there's all kinds of different kinds of s*x.
Okay, then, yes, a bunch, but we used a condom.
Their call.
Okay, great.
So I'm gonna have you put your feet in the stirrups and I want you to slide all the way to the end of the table so that I can take a look at your pussy.
All the way down.
Like, slide your pussy all the way down to the end of the table.
Okay.
When was the last time you were bleeding out of your pussy?
Um, two weeks ago.
Can-- Can you not refer to it as that?
Oh, I'm sorry.
When were you 
 out your pussy?
No, the um...
The-- Can you not say... "pussy"?
Oh, yeah, sure, fine. Whatever.
Okay, so I'm gonna take two fingers, I'm gonna put 'em in your hair pie.
I'm gonna feel around, apply some pressure to your ovaries and check you out for beav cancer, okay?
Listen...
Oh, did I press too hard?
I apologize.
No.
Okay, well, everything feels fine, so now I'm just gonna go ahead and clamp your clam open and then swab around the inside of your tuna taco and I'll have you on your way.
Yeah, no.
Can you just use the clinical term for v*g1n*?
I don't-- I don't see what's so hard about just saying v*g1n*.
I don't understand.
Are you referring to your sausage wallet?
Sausage wallet?
You know, your lizard mouth.
Does it really feel normal to you to refer to it this way?
I-- That would be like a proctologist calling a butt a--
(gagging) Butt?
(wretching)
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
I think I got some in your steaming hot pocket.
I'll get-- let me clean that up.

What is your favorite word for a pussy?
Stink wrinkle.
Stink wrinkle?
Yeah.
Ugh!
Favorite word for pussy? (bleep).
(laughing)
How do you refer to a woman's v*g1n*?
What's the word that you use?
I don't talk about it.
Well, you gotta--
It's gonna come up at some point.
I've been married for 32 years, I don't--
You have two kids.
Yeah, they're boys.
They're boys, but what did they come out of?
The uterus?
You ought to teach a science thing or something.
What do you call your v*g1n*?
Oh, enormous.
You gotta respect that.
♪♪
(group breathing deeply)
All right, good breathing.
That's class, you guys.
Now, does anybody have any questions?
Sure, Amy.
When I was just breathing just now, I started thinking, what if I don't feel connected to the baby?
I'm concerned about that, too.
Me too.
Oh, thank you.
I think you guys are talking about postpartum depression, and that totally makes sense.
One out of every seven new moms does suffer from it.
Yeah, no, no, um...
You're saying, no, that's not true?
I'm worried that, uh...
Our kid's just gonna have a sh1t vibe.
Sorry, come again?
Okay.
I-- I'm, like, ehh... You know?
And he's, like, the worst, so I feel like, when we made a baby, so it'll just be like...
(raspberry)
Her dad's my boss.
Gotcha.
So you're not talking about postpartum depression, you're just concerned that your baby's an asshole?
Okay, yeah, like, that's what I'm talking about, too.
And, like, off of what she said.
Right.
I think, just ultimately, we're mostly afraid that he won't be chill.
Like, what if he can't hang?
Or he hangs too hard and has one too many drinks and does that, like, slow-blinking thing.
Let's open it up.
Any-- Anybody else with some fears?
Bats.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I should have been more specific that I meant fears about the baby.
Okay, I have a fear about my human baby.
Okay, great.
Um...
I'm really scared that my baby's gonna be blind.
And nocturnal.
And fly.
Okay, I think we're getting into bat territory again, and I want to steer us away from that.
Like a bat.
(group murmuring)
Bats are everywhere, so.
: They're really not. Let's stay on track.
We're just gonna talk about fears about the baby.
What about baby-- baby bats?
(instructor stammering)
We're not gonna go down the bat thing again this class, okay?
Well, as long as it's black, though.
We're both black, so it's gonna be black.
A black baby.
It's gonna be black.
How many of you have even seen a bat?
In real life?
Okay, there we go.
You can't really get away from bats.
Let's just keep it on the discussion that we had going, which is: what your worries are about the baby.
Uh, we're Jewish, but we were afraid that our baby's going to be, like, 
 Jewish?
Yeah. Like, two sets of dishes Jewish.
And mark my words, no child of mine is gonna (bleep) through a sheet, okay?
Uh...
My biggest fear... is that our baby will want to participate in SantaCon.
That's where they dress up like Santa?
I-- I won that. A couple years ago.
I have to say yes, fear of a sh1t baby in this day and age, it's a-- it's a valid concern.
Okay.
Well, if we're really sharing things, I'm really afraid that our son is going to... be on those dating apps and that his profile pic will be him wearing those new year's glasses where the numbers are the eyes.
Oh...
And what if he does something totally unforgivable, like rape?
Or, um... DJ'ing?
Dads, you need to talk to your sons and say, don't DJ.
It starts in the home.
These are all really valid fears.
Look, your kids, they are gonna grow up to be pieces of sh1t and they will hate you.
But here's the thing.
All of you are also pieces of sh1t.
You really are.
Bat!
: Bat! Everyone for themselves!
♪♪♪♪
(noisy sighing)
What's wrong, Amy?
Nothing.
Oh, okay.
No, I'll tell you.
I got stuck on another awkward date last night.
It's, like, you know in two seconds if the guy is wrong for you, but you still have to sit there through the whole dinner.
You need to try the website I'm on.
It keeps dating super casual.
I already tried It's Just Lunch.
It was still awkward.
I'm off that.
I'm talking about It's Just a Quick What's Up.
It's Just a Quick What's Up?
Yeah.
When a guy decides he wants to briefly meet you, he'll send you a no-presh, super cash "slight nod".
Then when you respond with "I guess" using its patented sigh-activated technology, the app automatically will set up a time and place for you guys to walk past each other on the street.
What's up?
What's up?
Gosh, but ugh, what if even being close to a guy on the street makes me want to open my arms the right way?
For just another 49.99 a month, you can stand on a street corner and a guy will pass you in a double decker bus and wave.
What's up?
What's up?
If you want the premium package, for $75 a month, a guy in his 50s who doesn't want kids will buzz your door and say...
What's up?
...into the intercom.
How's it-- What's up?
: Wow.
What if I just want him to buzz?
Oh, my God, of course.
Everyone's on so much medication now that nobody wants to have s*x anyway.
Yeah, I guess it's true what they say.
"It's better to have said a quick what's up and lost than to have never said a quick what's up..."

♪♪
Dating apps. Mark is very familiar.
Yeah.
Mark, what--
Who have you said no to?
Like, what was the situation where you said no to s*x with a woman?
Well, you had s*x and it was bad, then I said no to the second one.
How did you say no?
I didn't answer the phone.
That's a clear no.
I gotta tell you this, no story.
I told this woman no, I couldn't have s*x with her because she started telling me about her son, and how sick he was.
Ooh, that's hot.
And how he had, like, eight surgeries.
This is in the middle of us trying to hook up, she starts telling me that.
Ugh.
And I was just like, yeah, I can't.
I can't do it.
And I'm sorry, but all I kept thinking was, is that gonna happen to me if I have s*x with her?
Like, you're gonna catch her son's thing?
I know it's totally irrational, but that's what I kept thinking.
Like, it's her v*g1n*'s fault and I'm not going anywhere near that v*g1n*.
What's the oldest woman you would have s*x with?
The oldest I've had s*x with is 48.
How old were you?
17.
Was that your virginity?
Yes.
Oh, my God.
Really?
You lost your virginity to an older woman.
Oh, yeah.
You must be-- You should be great in bed, then.
No...
No, there's no way.
She was a real pro.
Really?
I couldn't keep up, yeah, and I think it scarred me.
That's why I would assume you were great.
Was she a real pro, like...
I think she was a prostitute, but she didn't charge me.
Okay.
