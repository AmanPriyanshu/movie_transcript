Oh, my God.
I've been keeping Tucker away from it all.
Does he know what happened to his mommy?
He knows, but I don't think he understands.
Spence Westmore, you're under arrest for the murder of Peri Westmore.
If someone saw Spence, I can prove he's innocent.
Oh, yeah, he was here.
So he was here between 1:00 and 3:00 and not at home?
I'm here to help.
We need to find out who really killed Peri.
I have a witness. Her name is Cinnamon.
This case is closed. We've already got a confession.
I killed Peri.
As long as I'm in this chair, she won't leave me.
Give it up. I know you can walk.
I'm leaving you.
Evelyn, we were meant to be together.
I'm tired of it. I'm tired of you!
I'm Daniela! Your cousin Josefina's daughter?
That girl's your daughter?
My cousin Josefina... She raised her as her own.
So, she doesn't even know she's adopted?
I'm gonna be working here as a maid!
Name?
I'm a hot girl.
I can see that.
Big fashion exec just bought this place.
She's gonna be gone for six months.
This really cute guy came over and assumed I owned the house, so I went with it.
Kyle, is that you?
You didn't mention your mother was visiting.
She's not visiting. She lives here. Your mother's great.
I can see why you want to spend time with her.
I like her, too. But not for you.
I have other plans for you, Kyle.
I think there's something between us.
Peter.
Husband number three... the one who got away.
Please stop dating Peter.
I'm not breaking up with him.
This means war.
I can't believe you've never been here.
It's one of my favorites.
Well, you have good taste in men.
I'm sure you have good taste in food, too.
Oh, I have great taste in food.

Hi, I have a reservation. Marisol Suarez for two.
I don't have you.
I just called yesterday.
Well, it's not there.
You don't seem to be that busy.
I'm sure you could still seat us, even without a reservation.
I'm afraid not.
Take that couple to table 9, please.
Hey, they don't have a reservation.
I'm sorry.
One of our regulars has requested we not serve you.
Excuse me?
I think what you're doing is shameful, seeing that woman's husband.
Ex-husband.
Peter. How wonderful to see you.
Genevieve, are you blocking us from eating here?
I love the smell of that aftershave.
Or is that just your natural manly musk?
Don't talk about his musk.
What a shame you couldn't be seated.
Would you like to join me, Peter?
I have an extra chair.
She is ignoring me.
You can see very well that I'm with Marisol.
Perhaps she can have a little doggy bag in the car.
Don't make me take off my earrings.
Come on. We'll go somewhere else.
I told you she was upset.
Can't you do anything about it?
Genevieve is just looking for attention.
If we ignore her, she'll stop it.
Eventually.
Come on. You're a studio head.
You terrify people for a living.
All she did was cancel our reservation.
If that's the worst she's got, it's not really that bad.
I guess you're right.
There's my car.

Genevieve Delatour says hello.
Danni.

Oh. My bad.
I don't care about the couch. I'm talking about the weed.

Really.
Yes. I have glaucoma.
You shouldn't be doing drugs.
I thought you were cooler than this.
I'm cool.
You're just like my mom, telling me how to live my life.
That's why I had to get away from her.
You didn't let me finish.
You shouldn't be doing drugs inside the house.
If Mr. Powell walked in, you'd be in big trouble. Oh.
I mean, if it was just you and me, I'd say, "Pfft.

Oh.

Didn't Mr. Powell ask you to scrub the floors?
He did, but my glaucoma really hurts.
Hey.
I wasn't sure that you'd come.
Of course I came. I will always be there for you.
Even after what I did?
You didn't do anything.
I don't understand why you confessed.
Because I'm guilty, Rosie.
You told me you blacked out, that you don't remember what happened The night of Peri's murder.
Yeah, well, Ben came by for a visit and he helped me piece it together.
Ben?
My sponsor.
You know Ben. My good friend.
I've never heard of him.
I thought I'd known him for years.
You see? You were tricked.
And somehow you were tricked into confessing, too.
Rosie, I can see it in my mind. I killed Peri.
You couldn't have.
I found you an alibi.
The police didn't want to hear about it because, well, she's a stripper.
Rosie, stop.
The only thing that matters now is Tucker.
He doesn't have a mom or a dad anymore.
All he has is you.
Me?
I don't want him to become a ward of the state.
You were his nanny. You're great with him.
I know it's a lot, but...
I will take care of your son, Spence.
But only until I get you out of here.
You said to call if I heard anything interesting about Spence Westmore.
His ex found him an alibi.
Well, that's certainly interesting.
Hey.
Hi.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Pretty much like that.

But it doesn't make any sense.
Do you know a guy named Ben?
Sure. He's Peri's manager.
He visited the jail Right before Spence confessed.
I know it sounds weird, but I'm wondering...
No. It's not weird.
Before Peri died, Spence was starting to remember things, and then Ben talked to him.
And then Spence was different.
He didn't even want to remember anymore.
Ben is washing Spence's brain!
That's why he confessed!

Danni. Where are you?
Zoila's party already started.
Oh, my God. That was tonight?
You forgot?
I'm sorry! But I'm on my way.
See you soon.
Got to run. See you guys later.
Oh, hey. Don't I know you?
Oh, yeah.
You were working the door at Peri Westmore's party.
You wouldn't let me in.
Right. Let me make it up to you.
I'll buy you a drink.
Unless you got somewhere else to go.
Nope.
I'm all yours.

Ms. Shannon.
Rosie.
I didn't realize you were still here.
I wanted to stay with Tucker until he fell asleep.
Well, you didn't have to do that.
Jesse went home an hour ago.
I don't mind.
Actually, I could put Tucker to bed every night, if you'd like.
Well, that's not necessary.
I'll call a nanny service in the morning.
Is that what Tucker needs?
Another stranger in his life when he's already lost his mami and papi?
He'll adjust.
But if his nanny was someone he already knew, that would keep him calm.
And quiet.
My sister wouldn't...
Your sister is dead, and so it what happened between us.
Besides, I thought you were calling the shots now.
All right. I'll give it a try.
[Laughs] Thank you.
You won't regret it.
I hope not.

Genevieve.
Love the new look.
It is one thing to defile a person's reputation, but to attack their hair?
You've crossed a line.
Good. I've got your attention.
Now come in and sit down.
Lucky for you, I look like a young Jackie O. When I wear a head scarf.
Why are you so hung up on Peter?
You cheated on him.
Who told you that?
Peter.
He knows?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, dear.
I never wanted him to find out.
It was a mistake. It was a one-time thing.
I kept it from him to spare him the pain.
Well, he found out about it.
Do you really think he's gonna get back together with you after that?
Maybe.
If I spend the rest of my life making it up to him.
Okay. What is going on with you?
Why are you acting so... desperate?
I'm...
I've been just so lonely.
I guess I was grasping at anything that would help.
You've gone through times in your life without men before.
You've gotten through those, right?
It was different.
I had Zoila then.
Oh.
Men have come and gone, but Zoila...
She was my constant.
She just needs time. She'll come around.
What if she doesn't?
Carmen, sorry.
What happened?
You said you were on your way an hour ago.
I was, but then I met this guy.
He was super cute.
[Sniffs] Have you been drinking?
A little. Are you mad?
No.
Open.
Ah.
Now take these out there.
Come on.
And the next thing I know, Zoila tells Mario Batali his meatballs are good but that hers are better.
Well, they are.
[Laughter]
So I turn to Mario and I say...
[All gasp]
Oops.
"Oops"?
You just ruined my blouse.
Well, you bumped into me.
You know what? It was an accident.
Nobody's fault.
I'll just get some club soda for...
Club soda won't work on silk.
I'll have you know this is Brisbois.
That's French.
Is it French for "ugly"?
What did you say to me?
I'm sorry, Frances. She's new.
No, don't apologize for her.
What is it with your generation? The entitlement.
You're nothing but a rude little brat.
Hey, don't talk to Danni that way, you old bag of bones.
[Gasps]
Oh, dear God.
Zoila, are you going to allow this?
[Sighs]
Carmen, Danni, please apologize to my friend.
Oh, she's your friend?
Yes. Now say you're sorry.
[Scoffs]
Carmen.
[Gasps]
Okay. You're fired.
Both of you.
That's fine. We quit.
Come on.
Zoila, I know exactly how you feel.
It's so hard to find good help.
♪ ♪
Hey.
You ran out so fast tonight, I never got to pay you.
I did you a favor working the party tonight.
And you embarrassed me in front of all those people.
Look, I'm sorry about that.
But all you had to do was apologize.
All you had to do was take my side.
You're the one who encouraged me to play the part.
Well, you're playing it a little too well.
What's that supposed to mean?
You know, you say you're doing this for all the free stuff, but I think you like being one of those people.
Is that so bad?
Yeah, Zoila.
I saw you tonight, kissing everyone's ass.
It's like you're a completely different person.
Well, maybe that's the point, okay?
Maybe I don't want to be myself.
What are you talking about?
Look at my life.
I'm wearing nice clothes.
I'm going to fancy parties.
I have a chateau in Switzerland.
I'm not angry and empty all the time.
I never lost the baby.
The new me gets to be happy.
Well, the old you was my friend.

Well, we have lots to celebrate.
Genevieve called a truce.
Well, I'm glad.
Threesomes get a lot of hype, but I'm ready for it to just be the two of us.
I'll drink to that.

Seriously?
Mm.
I'll get rid of them. Here.

Evelyn! What are you doing here?
I'm not going back to Adrian.
I'm taking you up on your offer.
My offer?
You said if I ever needed anything, so I'm moving in.
Wow, I, um...
You can't turn me away.
I have nothing but the clothes on my back and the 17 Louis Vuitton suitcases in my car.
Believe me, if I had literally anywhere else to go, I would.
Actually, I have company right now.
Peter Hudson.
Oh, you can help with my bags.
Just don't expect a tip.

Danni, can I talk to you?
There.
That's better.
Oh, my God. What's your problem?
My problem is you.
Your behavior tonight was awful.
Is this about that old lady?
She was a real bitch.
Yeah, she was, but she was also right, and you were being a brat.
You defended me.
Because I wasn't gonna stand there and let her talk to you like that.
But you were out of line.
She bumped into me.
Okay, can you stop, Danni? Please stop.
It's not only about tonight.
It's the boys, the drugs. You're crashing cars.
I thought you were cool with all that.
Well, I'm not cool. Okay? I'm not.
I'm worried. You're going down a bad road.
Oh, my God. Don't talk to me like I'm a kid.
I'm talking to you like a kid because you're acting like a kid.
Well, it's none Of your business what I do.
You're not my mom.
You're right. I'm not.
Yeah, Josefina? It's Carmen.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm calling about Daniela.
I think she needs you.
Hey, hey, hey. Entrance around front.
Oh, no. I just...
I'm here to see Cinnamon.
Yeah, well, Cin didn't show up for work today.
What?
She missed her shift.
None of the girls know where she is.
Oh, my God.
Do you think something happened to her?
She's a stripper. Sometimes they just disappear.
Ahh.
Poor Rosie.
She'll be so sad to learn that Spence's alibi has gone up in smoke.
Yeah.
Poor little Rosie.
You'll have to go easy on her now that she's working here.
You okay with that?
Actually, I think it's kind of brilliant.
Keep your friends close.
And your enemies even closer.
