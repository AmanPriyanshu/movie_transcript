Please welcome Luke Wheeler.
Hey, Luke!
Hey.
[Cheers and applause]
Thanks for having me.
Thank you.
So, you're a hot topic right now for your very heated and very public battle with conservative pundit Cynthia Davis.
How'd this all start?
Well, I wanted to get my artist Will Lexington's music on the radio...
Right.
...uh, but we ran into some resistance because of his sexual orientation.
So I made a public plea to have his song requested, and Cynthia took offense.
And she says that you were shaming people into feeling like a bigot.
Well, um, Cynthia says a lot of things, a lot of which aren't true, but the truth is that Will is an amazing artist, and the conversation should be about his music.
Well, but regardless what the conversation 
 be, the fact remains that it's not about the music, really.
I mean, you've shined a light on a very important social issue.
So what's your stance on that?
Well, I believe that any discrimination... whether it be race, religion, or sexual orientation... is just plain wrong.
[Cheers and applause]
I couldn't agree more, but here's where I'm still confused.
I mean, you're the forerunner leading this charge.
Where's Lexington in all this?
Well, uh, Will's gone through a little personal tragedy.
He just lost his mom, so...
But he was refusing to comment even before that, right?
I think the problem that a lot of people have is, why does it seem like 
 care more than him?
Well, I don't know if it does seem like that, but I can assure you that Will cares.

There's a magic that happens.
Still does.

Deacon, you feel a great sense of guilt and remorse about your alcoholism, injuries to your wife.
Losing our daughter.
And, Rayna, is it fair to say that you have a history with men who, in one way or another, have disappointed you?
Your father... neglectful, controlling.
Deacon... unreliable, sometimes volatile.
Are you trying to say I've 
 this?
I'm not talking about choices... just patterns.
And as a result, you've had to, as you said, build a wall.
And, Deacon, to some degree, you have always seen Rayna as an unattainable ideal.
So I would posit that the work now would be for you, Deacon, to find a way to be relieved of that crippling burden of guilt and for you, Rayna, to find a way to take a step towards forgiveness.
You both have a deep mythology about this bond... its inevitability, the sense of yourselves as artists all tied up within it.
But there's a dark side to it.
I'm not questioning whether you both love each other or not.

It was simply a lame excuse to promote his new album.
Bad enough he rubs our noses in his morally depraved behavior, but to not have the guts to defend himself?
It's an embarrassment.
He and the rest of his so-called community should do this country a favor and just disappear.
: Listen.
Be in the moment.
Cut out the noise and just tell me...
What do you hear?

[Sighs]
I want Maddie back. That's what I want.
Me too.
[Cries softly]
[Sighs]
So, Mr. Big Shot.
[Laughs] How was that?
I-I still can't believe it was real.
Well, believe 
Elton said that you were an absolute natural out there.
Come on. He did not.
Yes, he did! Those were his exact words.
I promise you.
This just proves what I've been telling you from the beginning.
You have the goods.
You can do whatever you want all on your own.
[Sighs]
I mean, I don't know what to say. [Laughs]
Tonight was... it was a dream come true, and... you set it all up for me.
Well, I enjoy doing nice things for people I like.
And in case it wasn't already abundantly clear, I like you, Gunnar.
A lot.
: I'm pretty sure "Tommy Boy" is the best buddy comedy of all time.
You think that's the best buddy comedy of all time?
You didn't like it?
It's a complete mess.
I mean, the plot is all over the place.
You were laughing.
I was laughing 
 it, not 
 it.
[Inhales deeply]
Maybe we should just go to bed.
Hey. Every programmer I spoke to is raving about the album.
Rayna's gonna be thrilled when Bucky fills her in.
[Chuckles]
Well, I couldn't have gotten here without you, Glenn.
Thank you.
Hey, go celebrate. You earned it.
Should we go out or back to my place?
Uh, it's up to you.
I'm gonna swing by Juliette's first and, uh, check up on Cadence, then we can meet up after.
What are you in the mood for?
I don't know.
What's wrong?
Well, I don't even know why we're celebrating.
Glenn can say that everyone's excited about the album, but Rayna couldn't even make it to the launch.
I don't think that means that they're not excited.
You know the first time I played here, she blew me off?
And then she literally let Markus Keen just steal my spotlight at my Opry debut.
And then she did nothing when Autumn gave my tour spot away to the Exes.
So, I mean, what does it matter how tonight went when my label obviously couldn't care less about me?
Hey.
Of course Highway 65 cares about you.
I mean, look. Look at this.
Yeah, but I just feel like crying.
It's just, tonight was supposed to be perfect, and Rayna just ruined it.
It's not ruined. Okay?
Come on.
I'm gonna take you out, and we're gonna turn it all around, starting right now.
What about Cadence?
I was being a little overprotective.
I'm sure she's fine.
Come on. Let's go.
You really are the best boyfriend.
[Door opens]
: Hey! There you are.
Jackie said the shoot went great.
[Sighs]
Whoa.
What's going on? What's wrong?
Gunnar's right.
I 
 afraid.
I'm afraid of the truth.
And it doesn't matter how much I try to ignore it, wipe it away, stamp it out.
I can't anymore.
What are you talking about?
I'm in love with him.
I'm in love with Gunnar.
So, what's going on over there?
You're such a great guy.
You're amazing with Cadence and just... so passionate about stuff.
Oh, there's a "but" coming, right?
But I'm not sure we're passionate about the same stuff.
You don't think we 
 be, with time?
I just don't think we have the connection that I need to feel right now.
I guess the fantasy's better than the reality, huh?
At least we tried, right?
You don't have to leave.
I know.
But I-I probably should.
How bad is it?
Oh, it's barely noticeable.
[Both chuckle]
[Cellphone ringing]
Hold on a sec.
Let me grab this.
Hey, Will.
Hey. How's Colt?
Oh, he's gonna be all right. He's a tough kid.
How'd the radio spot go?
It went good.
Apparently, word about it spread, because it lit a fire under Cynthia Davis again.
Oh, you know what? [Sighs] Don't you worry about her.
Some people got so much hate in them, it's just not worth it.
Actually, um...
I made a decision.
I want to go on the show... take her on face-to-face.
Okay.
I'm, uh, not sure what changed your mind, but, uh, if that's what you want, I'll make a call and book us a time.
No, you've done so much for me, Luke, and I am truly grateful, but... it's time for me to take from here.
Well, all right, then.
Go get 'er, son.
