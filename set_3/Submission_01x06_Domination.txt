So you don't strike me as a girl that likes to read smut.
You're Nolan Keats?
Yes. It's my pen name.
I don't believe you.
So is this the new book you have coming out in the fall?
: Yes.
He's playing you. Hard.
I need you to know that I'm yours.
: Do you like it?
: It's incredible.
You're in a situation where there's an abuse of power.
: You're in a relationship?
Not a relationship.
Why not?
: They're married and I work for both of them.
End it or I'm done.
Maybe there's a way we can fix this.
I'm going to start f*cking both of them.
Oh, f*ck.
I'm getting really tired of you telling me no.
: I pay you, remember? To find me women.
But you're not worth the hassle anymore.
Give me the keys and get the f*ck out of here.

: "He had full possession over me, and I had become a slave to his every need. I lived to be dominated by him."
Are your books based on real life?
Sometimes.
Do you think you'll ever write about us?
I'd rather keep that sacred.
This is my favorite part.
"I crave those moments where he would look at me, down on my knees, and know he'd put me there, taught me that, enslaved me to him."
[Dillon on cell phone] The nondisclosure was a nice touch.
[Elliott on cell phone] It sells the story.

You don't want to talk, fine.
I'll send the email.
Don't you dare.
Then start talking.
I didn't expect it to go this far.
I was going to end it after the first night, but...

I got caught up in it, okay?

Threesomes are completely overrated.
I beg to differ.
It didn't go well?
Dude, it was a f*cking nightmare.
What happened?
Men are incapable of pleasing two women at once.
Depends on the man.
Oh, please.
No, it doesn't.
Our bodies are way too complex.
Men can barely handle one of us.
Not true. I once had s*x with these two women from my mom's divorced wives club, and they still hit me up for s*x.
You're such a liar.
Dead serious.
Big tit Melanie Masterson and Roberta Johnson.
How does something like that even go down?
It was the weirdest thing.
So Roberta calls my mom and asked to borrow a card table for this party that she's throwing at her house.
Hi, Rafe.
Hi, Mrs. Johnson.
Why don't you come on in?
Oh, awesome.

So I bring it over to her place and Melanie's there.
She's blowing up balloons and sh1t.
She's wearing this dress that barely covers her tits, and I'm trying not to stare at them, but I can't not stare at them because they're completely hanging out.
And then, out of nowhere, she starts eye-fucking me, like not even subtly.
And I'm trying to figure out if she wants to f*ck me or if she's f*cking around, because the whole thing feels like a complete set up.
To a really great porno.
[chuckles]
You think I'm lying?
Yes.
I swear to God I'm not, okay? So...
Oh, aren't you cute.

No, but I know quite a bit about Elliott.
Not as much as I do.

Running his errands and getting him women.
Is that all he told you?
I know you two slept together, if that's what you're smiling about.
And I also know you got needy and that's why he ended it.
I wasn't needy. I was frustrated.
Because he didn't love you.
He told me everything, Dillon.

Yes.

But Ashley, on the other hand, she most certainly is.
Unfortunately, I don't think that after this morning she'll be submitting to you anymore because I told her everything.
I guess in a weird way keeping the little Nolan Keats thing a secret felt almost like an act of submission, and as you know quite well, I'm really bad at submission.
I make a far better dominant.
So I showed her the video and explained to her who Nolan Keats really is.
Not because it was the right thing to do, but because it was the ultimate act of domination.

You should be locked up.
I was going to tell you.
When?
I was waiting for the right time, okay?
Oh, yeah, 'cause there is no right time to tell someone that their entire relationship is based on a lie.
You know that's not true.
How is that not true?
You've been lying to me since day one.
You sent me his f*cking book as proof...
And you ate up every word of it.

I had no reason not to.
You just loved the fact that you were dating some s*x writer.
