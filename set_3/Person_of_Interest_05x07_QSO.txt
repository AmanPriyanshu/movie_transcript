Is that so?
Yes, sir.
I am 80% sure that I was abducted by honest-to-goodness extraterrestrials last night.
See, I was leaving the store when...
: I'm sorry to interrupt, my friend.
I would love to hear your story at another time, but right now I think we have more pressing issues, so let's go to another caller.
You're on with Mysterious Transmissions.
What do you got?
: I know what the messages are.
Great, lay it on me.
: It's Electronic Voice Phenomena.
I know because that's how Marie Antoinette communicates with me all the time, and apparently her power increases in the fall.
Max overestimated how much his listeners care.
It's better if Samaritan thinks Max is just a kook no one's gonna believe.
Look, I don't think you guys understand what we have here.

This is proof...

We never should have trusted the Machine's word.
Damn thing's been acting strangely since we put it back together.
She's not acting strangely.
She's doing exactly what She's programmed to do.
Ms. Groves...
The Machine can tell us where to go, who's in trouble, but we still have free will.

Max chose to risk his life.
She can't stop him from doing that, and now Shaw knows that we haven't given up on her.
♪ ♪
I wish we could've saved Max, but if we were able to give Shaw some kind of hope?
♪ ♪
Maybe it was worth it.
A lie by omission is still a lie.

And using the idea of free will as an excuse for... moral attrition?

Hi, it's the ballerina.

Let's go on a trip.
I want to see your hometown.

In fact, my father is the administrator of Zemaitija National Park.
I can take you.
I would like that very much.
