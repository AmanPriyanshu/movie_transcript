That was amazing!
I can't believe I've never seen that part of the reef before.
Told you we knew a few secret spots.
I can't wait to meet the pod tonight.
It's your first full moon ceremony. Are you excited?
Uh, do mermaids have scales?
See?
There are some perks to having a moon ring.
: Whoo!
Hey.
Hi.
I haven't ordered anything.
It's my new smoothie flavor. Fresh prawns and oysters.
Oh.
I'm joking. It's mango.
So, what time are we all heading to Mako tonight?
Um... "we"?
Yeah, I thought I'd tag along, check out this full moon gig.
It's not a gig, it's a ceremony.
And it's mermaids only.
He's just stirring. We're having a card night tonight.
: Hey, David.
You want to hang out with Zac and me tonight?
Play some cards... It'll take your mind off, you know...
Sirena.
I really miss her.
I know she deserves a holiday with her sister, but...
Hawaii is just so far away.
I guess it is a bit far to visit in the tinny.
Veridia.
Is everything all right?
Everything's fine. Veridia and I are just catching up.
I'm glad that you're here.
I have a special job for you, Ondina.
Now that the pod has returned home, we're in need of a smart, talented mermaid.
Someone with the courage and skill you've demonstrated.
Whatever it is, I'm ready.
Good.
We need a teacher.
Well, of course, it's... it's a great honor... but I'm hardly qualified.
I disagree.
I think you'll make an excellent role model for the little mermaids.
Are you really friends with the merman? What's he like?
When can we get our moon rings?
: Is it true you live on land?
Can we go there, too?
Absolutely not.
Now quiet, all of you.
Why can't we go on land?
: Please, Ondina?
We've never done that before.
Quiet!
You have a lot to learn before you're going anywhere near land.
Starting with the basics. 
Now... does anyone know how to form a water ball?
Are you kidding me?
Water balls?
: Seriously?
: Are you joking?
Ah! Perfect timing.
Look, I need you on the trawler today. My usual deckhand is sick.
Can't you get someone else?
If I could, I would.
Okay, you're my last resort. I promise.
I've got a café to run.
Carly will look after it.
Now hurry up, time is money.
You know I'm no good on the trawler. The diesel fumes make me nauseous.
You're coming, like it or not. Okay?
Watch carefully.
With a little concentration, you'll all be doing this in no time.
It even took me a little while to learn this, but you have to be patient.
Stop stressing, David. I'll manage.
Bye.
What's up?
 David's stuck on the trawler with Joe.
Looks like he'll be gone all day.
He'd better be back in time for our card game.
While you're planning the big game, I've got a café to run... by myself.
And you're doing a great job.
You could help out a little.
Sure.
Can I get a double cheeseburger? And fries?
And a choc shake?
You're kidding... right?
I can't work on an empty stomach.
What?
You have a lot to learn, my friend.
See? It just takes practice.
Where is Amaris?
She went that way.
 Wonderful.
: Well, it's about time.
 Amaris?
Don't be scared. I won't hurt you.
Oi! What are you doing?
Quit clowning around, will you?
That's okay, I'll get it.
Oh, you know what? No, no, no, no, no.
Take a rest, mate. You've done too much already.
Don't worry. I'll get you out of here.
Relax, relax, okay? I'll do everything.
: It's all right. I'll... I'll get it.
Actually, you know what? Get those crates on board.
Whoa!
What was that? Come on.
Go.
Don't you ever do anything like that again. Understand?
You can't go near land people.
But you do.
I'm older. I can handle it.
You know you were nearly trapped, right?
Yes, Ondina, but that mermaid saved me.
Who is she?
She was using magic in broad daylight.
Did anyone see her?
I don't think so.
And you're sure that she wasn't from our pod?
I've never seen her before.
What kind of mermaid would risk our secret like that?
: Girls.
I'm glad you're here. I'd like you to meet Weilan.
She's from Shanghai and she's going to be staying with us for a while.
Good to meet you, Weilan.
My pleasure to be here.
I visited Shanghai years ago. Weilan's family were very welcoming.
I'll expect you to offer her the same degree of hospitality.
Of course.
I have to go, but the girls will show you around.
What do you think you were doing?
Excuse me?
At the marina. I saw you.
I was helping the little mermaid.
 I'm her teacher. I had it under control.
Of course.
Letting her wander into a net is all part of the learning experience, right?
Why don't we show you around?
Great.
Nice place.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Cool!
This place is amazing.
 And you have a cat! I love cats!
: His name is Poseidon.
Hello.
What are you doing here?
I... needed a holiday.
 You're so gorgeous.
You have a phone?
Yeah.
So, what does a mermaid do for fun around here?
I'm not your tour guide. I'm going to the moon pool.
The moon pool?
Would you like to see it?
I don't think she'd be interested.
Are you kidding? The famous Mako moon pool?
I'd love to see it.
Well, something must have caused it.
Things just don't go... 
 flying into the air.
Maybe it was a gust of wind.
A gust of...
You know what? Just leave it. Okay?
We've got to get under way.
Oh, we're not still going out?
Of course we are. Come on, we've got fish to catch!
Casting off!
: Here we are.
What do you think?
I thought it'd be bigger.
You know, with fountains and jewels and maybe a flat screen TV.
Unbelievable.
Kidding!
We sleep here every night.
: Really?
I prefer a soft, dry bed.
I hear there's one waiting for you in Shanghai.
: Ondina.
Maybe we can go somewhere else.
The full moon ceremony is tonight. You should come.
She doesn't have a moon ring.
Thanks, but... to be honest, I'm more comfortable on land.
I bet your pod's thrilled about that.
I don't have a pod.
Why not?
Thanks for showing me around.
: At least come to the café tonight before we go.
You can meet some of our friends.
Sounds great.
Why are you being so nice to her?
She's a mermaid, just like us.
She is not like us.
: I think I'm gonna be sick.
Take your mind off it.
Think about... raw squid.
Lasagna.
Roller coasters.
Get the nets ready, will you?
: Let me get this straight.
The guy with the boat at the dock was David, but he knows about us.
And so does Cam.
And Evie.
And she has a tail?
Right.
And Evie's boyfriend, Zac, is my brother.
He's a merman.
Your brother is a merman?
 This I have to see.
Everyone, meet Weilan.
Weilan, this is Evie and Cam... and Zac.
So you're a merman.
Huh!
What?
Nothing, it's just... I thought you'd be bigger.
Don't worry, Zac. She's difficult to please.
You guys ready to order?
Carly, this is Weilan. She'll be staying with us for a while.
I'm guessing you're another, um...
Is that some kind of secret code?
Yes, Weilan is a mermaid.
Is there anybody here who doesn't know about mermaids?
So, I'm guessing by your accent, you're not from around here?
I'm from the Northern Pod, but I've been here since I was very young.
Why don't you have a pod?
Shouldn't we be going? We don't want to be late.
: Have fun out there.
Thanks.
: Don't worry.
We'll bring her back safe and sound.
Ready?
Everything secure?
Yes.
Can we go back now?
I might still be able to make my card game.
What is that?
Uh, it must have been a whale.
That was no whale.
What are you doing?
It's heading to Mako, and I'm going after it.
: Where is the pod?
: On the other side of Mako.
I've got butterflies.
You'll be fine.
Just follow our lead.
What's up?
I don't know.
What's that?
Nothing from David. Looks like it's just you and me.
It's a shame. He's so easy to fleece.
Come on, let's play some cards.
: You okay?
Mimmi is in danger.
What?
It looks... like a dragon.
 Oh, no.
I have to go.
Come on. Come on!
Shouldn't we alert the coast guard?
The coast guard?
What, and let them take all the glory?
No way! This could be the biggest haul of my life.
Whoo!
Whoa!
What is that?
We've got to go.
David's on that boat.
He'll be fine.
Are you kidding? Look at that thing.
It doesn't want land people. Only mermaids.
How do you know?
: There's no time.
We have to warn your pod.
Thanks to your warning, the pod are now safe in the caves under Mako.
What was that thing?
I've never seen anything like it.
I have.
The dragon appeared a month ago in Shanghai.
Weilan's grandmother sent her here for safekeeping.
You didn't think of telling us?
We need to understand this threat and find a way to stop it.
There is no way.
There has to be.
The dragon's sole purpose is to destroy mermaids.
It wiped out the Eastern Pod, and now it has come here.
No mermaid is safe.
