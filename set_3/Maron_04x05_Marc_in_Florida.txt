Oh, this looks good.
Thanks, man. I-I... I'm digging it.
You see, this is me on the bridge to recovery, right?

Uh, yeah, I'm letting that go this year.
I've got to say, you're making real progress.
Yeah, you think so? I mean, I can feel it.
You know, I... I think, back in the day, I... I would've thought this... this sh1t was ridiculous, you know?
Even now, if I think about it for a few seconds, it's... it's pretty stupid.
But... but it seems to be working.
That's called healing.
Okay, I'll take it.
Great. So, uh, your 28 days are almost up.
Yeah.
What have you lined up for yourself post-treatment?
Nothing really.
I'm just sort of pretending that it's not happening.
Well, it's happening.
You need to figure out where you're going.
Isn't it, like, negotiable?
Can't I just do, like, post-grad work?
You know, like I...
I think I can take this scrapbooking thing to the next level.
Don't sell yourself short. You're ready.
You need to just figure out your next steps.
You figured it out. You never left.
Why don't you just set me up in an office here?
Well, I think being a drug counselor isn't a bad path for you.
You need to be five-years sober, and, uh, get a Master's degree in Psychology.
And if you want to get the license, well, then that requires 2,000-to-3,000 hours of clinical research... unpaid, by the way... and, of course, you have to be willing to listen to people like you.
Yeah.
I'll get my stuff together.

Nice to have responsible parents.

It's Marc, Toni's son.
Ah. Marc. Marc.
How you doing?
So, uh, you're picking up my mom's phone now, huh?
Things getting pretty tight between you two, I guess?
Well, the phone was ringing, I was right next to it, you know?
Don't... don't read too much into it.
So your mom says, uh, that you're in drug rehab.
Yes, I had to work through some stuff.
You know, back in the '80s, I did my share of drugs.
And when it got too much, I just... I just stopped.
Nothing else, just stopped.
Oh, okay. Well, good for you.
No doctors, no shrinks, just... willpower.
Fantastic.
Is my mother there?
Toni! It's your son Marc!
He's on the phone!
He's calling you from drug rehab!
Oh, my God, what a dick.
What? Excuse me?
Nothing.
Marc, how are you?
Hi, Ma.
Uh, I don't like talking to that guy.
Well, that's because you're so much alike.
Well, that's creepy.
Look, I'm, uh... I'm being discharged.
Oh, you're graduating?
Yes, Mom, I'm graduating.
And I'm gonna need a little money to get back on my feet.
You can think of it as a graduation present, if that's helpful.
Ma, are you there?
Marc, I can't give you any money.
That would be enabling.
Well, look, you'd be 
 me to get on with my life, all right?
I need to find a place to live.
How do I know you're not gonna use it on drugs?
You can't help yourself.
I... I know how to be sober.
If you need a place to stay, why don't you come here?
Ooh. 'Cause that sounds terrible.
Why not? Let me take care of you.
Well, you're not really the Florence Nightingale type.
Why would you say such a thing?
You said it. Those are your words.
Just come on. I'll send you a ticket through the computer.
You know what? Don't worry about it, all right?
I'll figure something out.
Oh, and by the way, your boyfriend brags about doing a lot of drugs in the '80s.
Yeah, well, he had no problem stopping.
But back then, it wasn't a disease.

Thank you, Adam, for teaching me.

I'm a terrible mother, and it's all my fault.
No, no, no, no, it's not your fault.
I'm a drug addict and, you know, sadly, this happens sometimes.
But do I need to hide my pills?
Not a bad idea.

No, no, I don't need socks, but... but... but I'm curious about this schmeck, Ralph.
Don't be a wise-ass. You know what I'm saying.

Not really.

So, Ralph, he said that, uh, I'm the one keeping you guys from moving in together.
He said that?
Oh.
For the record, I never told him he could move in.
He forced the idea on me. He thinks it's practical.
So you're not into it?
Sometimes I even wonder why I'm going with him.
He's rude, he's overbearing, he's a know-it-all.

That's great news, Ma.
You're kidding?
No. Why? You don't think I can do it?
You're going to spend 1,000 bucks to get certified, and then in the middle of the thing, you're gonna drop out, right?
What do you got, a... a crystal ball in that long, droopy sack of yours?
Pardon me?
You're an asshole, you know that?
Why do you got to sh1t on everything she does?
Because you're a big shot?
You on drugs again?
Oh, yeah, yeah, because no one in their right mind could think that you're a blowhard and a douchebag.
Well, guess what, Ralph? She can't stand you.
Marc, stop it.
