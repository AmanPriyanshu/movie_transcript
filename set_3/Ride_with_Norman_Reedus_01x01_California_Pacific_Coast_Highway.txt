: 
: 
It's such a different energy.
: 
Just from right here we can go ride the ocean, get the sun, and we can go right up into the redwoods and be in twisties.
: 
Cali's the mecca, man. So many great little excursions on the way up.
Ah! Whoo!
(Reedus laughs)
: 
I'm so happy we found this place.
Anything that makes noise attracts zombies.
Is your dog snoring right now? Is that what that was?
(motors revving)
: 
Let's do it.
: 
(motor starts)
(music playing)
Even though this is where I really learned to love bikes, and I rode all the time, I never really had the chance to explore. That's why I'm so excited to be back. Taking my first ride up the Pacific Coast Highway.
: 
: 
Hey, what's up, Norman?
Hey, nice to meet you, Roland.
Absolutely.
I've heard great things about you.
Welcome, man. I've heard some great things about you as well.
Yeah, I came over here on this sucker.
This Hypermotard.
Sick, man.
: 
These bikes, man, to me, they're just, like, the sickest hooligan bike ever.
Show me some of your stuff, man. I want to see everything.
This is our home, dude.
Wow, it's like a museum.
Man, there are so many bikes crammed in here.
There are 75 bikes in this building.
Wow.
We build cafe racers out of Sportsters.
So we have a whole line of hard parts that we sell.
This is so "Mad Max" right here.
: 
: 
Is there anything you don't do?
Sleep.
I know that very well.
What's up? Good morning. Hi.
How's it going, everybody?
When people see your bikes, they automatically know they're yours.
Kind of, yeah.
What makes a Roland Sands bike?
I think primarily, like, I want to build bikes that work better than the stock bike.
 better wheels, you know, and I think the blending of styles, too.
Like, this bike kind of just kicked off my career in a sense.
 of sport bike and chopper culture smashed together in one motorcycle.
: 
Is this your pop right here?
Yeah.
My dad started a company called Performance Machines.
So, I mean, when I was five years old, I was at drag races.
You know, I used to go to Laguna Seca and go watch the grand prix back then.
Seca's awesome.
So I can ride one of these?
This is the fleet, man.
So we got flat track racers. Harley softails.
Cafe racers. This is a Superleggera.
What about this guy? How's this one?
This is a BMW nineT.
: 
[i]It's a fun bike. We did a number plate on the front, moved the oil cooler up so we exposed the breastplate.
Ohlin suspension front and rear.
It's a badass-sounding bike.
Yeah.
(motor starts)
I'll grab your bike and I'll meet you in the back.
All right, cool.
: 
: 
This is my old hood.
This is where I grew up.
Yeah. (laughs)
(laughs)
Yeah.
That was awesome.
Yeah, I like to mess around a little bit.
I'm kind of an idiot.
I will not be doing that.
Loving this.
You like it?
I like the way this handles and rides. It's so nice.
: 
This is beautiful, dude.
: 
Palos Verdes.
This is beautiful up here, man.
Yeah, this is like a ride we do on the weekends. We come up here.
And that's Catalina.
That's Catalina right there.
Spend a lot of time over there.
Is PCH like this? This sort of vibe?
It's even a little bit more grand.
It's like the mountains just got... like God cut the mountains off and it drops straight down into the ocean.
Wow.
It's amazing.
Well, dude, right on. I'm out.
I'm gonna go head up and go back to work, man.
I wish I could go with you.
I would love it. I might steal your motorcycle and take it with me.
Go for it.
(laughs)
I think it likes you.
Yeah, as long as you get it back, I don't care.
Eeee! Done.
(laughs)
Thank you, bro.
All right, Norman. Be safe.
Have fun and take chances.
I will. It'll be fun.

Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.
How are you?
Good, how you doing?
I'm good. I'm good.
It's been a minute.
Hell, yeah.
Look at this thing.
Yeah, right?
I took a Ducati to Roland Sands' place, and I liked this so much I kind of stole it from him.
That is a crazy looking bike.
Yeah.
So we'll take this up the coast with us.
I mean, this is yours, right?
Yes. Well, it's not mine.
I'm borrowing it, but I love this thing.
: 
This'll be great going up the coast.
I know, and this has, like, an adjustable windshield.
Oh, it goes up and down?
: 
But first...
Show me your shop.
Come in the shop.
This is awesome in here.
: 
Yes. So my uncle and my aunt started it, and my parents... my mom and dad met working there together, 
Wow. Tell me about that creepy skeleton up there in the corner.
Real or not real?
This is actually our resident only real skull in the shop.
Our London shop is actually built on a plague pit.
So when there was, like, the Black Plague and they had mass graves... and they excavated in the basement of our shop, and it was a mass grave.
And a lot of the original skulls we have in our London shop are from there.
What? What? That's sort of creepy.
You need to pick a ring as well.
You've got to have a skull ring.
Can you pick one for me?
I can do that.
Yeah?
I feel like you need a gnarly looking skull.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is perfect for me.
Let's see if he fits. Are you excited?
I'm excited, yeah. This is my first ring ever.
And it fits.
Yeah, this is badass.
Were you wearing all your stuff in Atlanta when we met?
On the cross-country trip I wore some of my stuff.
I wasn't as heavily loaded as I usually am when I'm around LA.
That was really fun when you guys all came down.
I had such a good time.
: 
Okay, that's the most beautiful ride in California you can do.
There's a podcast up there which is "Motorcycle Misfits."
Really? I'm scared to hear my voice on a podcast...
Your voice is great.
...but it'll be fun.
Tonight, there is an Airstream motor camp that would be so cool to stay at.
Oh, nice.
They deck them out to make them look awesome.
Where is that?
In Santa Barbara.
I love Airstreams, but I've never been in an Airstream.
All right.
Cool, let's go hit the highway.
: 
: 
You ready, babe?
This changed so much here. There used to be this place called Damiano's right there.
A pizza place. It's where I first became an actor.
It was in that pizza place.
That's cool.
: 
This is fun.
I like riding around with you.
It's gonna be even better when we're on the open road, too.
And it will be, like, daytime and, like, beautiful coast.
: 
This is so cool.
They match my bike.
Oh, yeah.
I love that they put AstroTurf around, too.
Yeah.
All right.
Oh, my God. They have a bathtub.
Coffee pot, check.
It's even got a little kitchen and a mini fridge.
I'm having this one.
This is yours? You got it. Done.
Tomorrow's gonna be, like, PCH.
Beautiful, no LA traffic.
Yeah, let's hope so.
It'll be the pretty part.
Yeah, good. I'm gonna go take a bath in an air bubble.
(laughs)
What the (bleep)? You peeper.
Little peeper.
The ocean! Whoo!
Oh, the ocean.
Oh, cool.
He built this whole place out of junk.
: 
Oh, my God!
(Reedus laughing)

("Hollywood" playing)
(knocks)
Are you having a party in here?
This is so cool. I like sleeping in an airstream.
It was pretty cool except for every time you walk by a desk, you clear the desk by accident.
You know what I mean?
I didn't have that problem.
Yeah, well, you're skinny, that's why.
All right, let's roll.
You're not exactly fat.
Not exactly fat? What is that supposed to mean?
I'm excited to ride.
Yeah, it's gonna be nice today.
(motor revving)
Wow, it's so pretty.
So beautiful.
Yeah.
: 
Can you hear me?
When do we get to the ocean?
I can't understand you.
: 
I'm just gonna guess at what you're saying.
Something about an alarm clock.
Nothing about Alaska.
(laughs)
A baked Alaska.
The ocean! Whoo!
Oh, the ocean.
Whoo-hoo!
: 
Look how sparkly it is.
: 
Pismo Beach, 15 miles.
Yeah.
: 
Let's go to the beach.
: 
Look how pretty this is.
Yeah, this is beautiful.
(grunts)
What are these little birds called?
Oyster catchers. They're cute.
Catch one.
How cold you reckon the water is?
Freezing?
I bet it's freezing.
Stay away from me.
That looks like a dune buggy, right?
That's cool. Have you ever dune-buggied?
Never.
Me either.
Let's go dune buggy.
♪ Little dune buggy. ♪
: 
How's it going? I'm Norman.
Glad to meet you. Robert.
Hi, Imogen.
Oh, cool. Thank you.
Your first time out here?
First time ever here and on a dune buggy.
First time dune-buggying.
Part of our protocol too is you have to watch a safety video.
Okay. What did you do to your screen?
Well...
It's beach modified.
It's kind of scary to watch a safety video on this screen.
You know what I mean?
We're a little hard on things out here.
: 
Can you imagine trying to run over these little birds?
Do people do that?
They try.
: This is gonna be fun.
Loss of life?
Animal life.
(music playing)
: 
Let's do it.
What's the fastest one you have? This one?
(laughs)
Have a good time.
Yeah, I'm excited.
Thank you.
: 
: 
Whoo!
: You ready? Check this out.
Are you serious? Oh my god that looks crazy!
Yeah! Whoo!
(laughs)
This way. Go right down this big mountain.
Aah!
(laughs)
Whoo!
Whoo!
Hold on, I got stuck. I got stuck on this hill.
(laughs)
I'm over here.
(Reedus laughs)
Whoa.
Whoa, I don't know if I can do this.
Whoo!
Whee! Whoo!
Aw!
I'm sorry, Norman.
I got you, babe.
I'm driving like a grandma, aren't I?
Whoo!
This way. Here we go.
Follow me.
Ah!
(shrieks)
(laughs)
Oh! Whoa, airborne. I just went airborne.
My God! Whoo! Whoo!
I got some air.
(laughs)
Let's go to the big one.
Oh, (bleep).
Oh my god.
And good-bye.
Ah!
Oh, my God, I want to do this for, like, five hours.
All right, all right.
That was awesome.
(camera clicking)
: 
: 
: 
Any time.
Thanks, man.
: 
: 
There's stuff in here from, like, the '30s, '40s, 
: 
This is from "The Walking Dead."
That's rad.
This bike is running right now.
Wait, it's running right now?
It's running right now.
Shut up.
Let's do it.
You look so cool.
You're a ninja right now.
Yeah, dune buggies are awesome.
Yeah, dude. I had no idea it was that much fun.
I feel like I've gained weight in my palms on this trip.
My palms have become meaty.
Yeah, I couldn't get the thing on my thing.
That's why I put the thing on your thing.
Know what I mean?
Yeah.
Know what I'm saying?
Know what I'm saying?
(both laugh)
: 
Wow, California sunset right there.
: 
So beautiful.
So beautiful.
: 
I start to daydream.
I just start like, "Ah."
I have ADDDDDDD. You know what I mean?
(laughs) No.
: 
Oh, yeah.
Feel the cold creeping in.
Yeah.
: 
I can't hear what you're saying, but I'm happy.
I can't hear what you're saying.
(both laugh)
: 
Yeah, it looks like it.
That looks amazing. Can we go in there?
What the hell?
Hey.
What the...?
How you guys doing?
How you doing, man? Norman. Hi.
Pretty good. My name's Mike.
Nice to meet you, Mike.
: 
The man who built this place, his name was actually Art Beal, but they gave him a couple colorful nicknames, and one of them was Captain Nitwit.
Oh, wow.
He started building in 1928.
He lived in this place till 1989, till he was 92 years old.
: 
: 
Yeah, that's cool.
See all these handrails?
Yeah.
This was the plumbing system. They all carried water.
There's handrails throughout the whole property.
He also had a lot of toilet seats, which he would actually use for picture frames.
(laughs)
Oh, my God.
He called this his woman's room.
What the?
Wait, who are you?
Like, how are you involved here?
My wife and I bought this in 1999 from the Art Beal Foundation.
I thought I'd give the Anti-Hearst Castle tour.
William Randolph Hearst built this place in 1919
 and this is the anti. This guy was a garbage man in town that took all the garbage from town...
Oh, so he collected garbage and put this together from it?
He got paid as a garbage man.
Art claimed this stairway stayed 50 degrees.
This was his refrigerator.
I feel the chill in here. It is colder.
That's his stuff.
What is that?
There's peaches, there's apricots.
There's stuff in here from, like, the '30s, '40s, up until the '80s.
This is so crazy. I'm so happy we found this place.
: 
: 
 and he'd walk around town in that thing.
They tell me he got older and it'd get windy.
Oh, my God.
(laughing)
And this is his two-seated outhouse.
He said he put his and her toilets in here.
He could sit here and have conversations with people.
: 
He thought he was a swinger, but then he never had kids.
He has no family?
And he never had any family.
I thought by now, after 15 years I've been up here, "I'm his grandkid. I'm his..." no. It's weird.
But he liked ladies, and ladies liked him.
He's, like, an enigma.
He's kind of a romantic.
Yeah.
Yeah.
: 
 created his own legacy with nothing but junk.
: 
There's a toilet on top of the roof.
And people said that's his throne.
He's the king of the castle up there.
: 
Thank you for showing us all of this.
Take care, man.
Yeah, you, too.
: 
Bye, cool house.
♪ Everyone is seeing that I'm something else ♪

♪ I'm not living on somebody's shelf... ♪
: 
I just like the way the air smells up here. It's so clean.
: 
Look at that crazy house.
Yeah, that's beautiful.
It's got a nice eclectic feel.
I hate when cities start taking over and making everything look the same.
: 
Are these electric?
: 
For some reason I imagined them looking all crazy different.
: 
Ready to check this out?
Yeah.
I used to have a dog named Zero.
Really?
Yeah.
: 
Nice to meet you, too. Welcome to Zero.
All right.
All right, let's go on back into the belly of the beast.
: 
: 
 building motorcycles, and it's not loud.
It's just super weird to me.
Yeah.
(laughs)
This is where it all started for Zero.
This is the first electric motorcycle ever built.
It's like a dirt bike, right?
It was kind of cross between an overgrown mountain bike and a motorcycle.
I think it's cool. I really like that one.
Well, it was the idea of what could we do to change the way the world experiences motorcycles.
What kind of bike did you ride before you got into electric motorcycles?
I was a dirt bike rider. I was born in Las Vegas, and I rode dirt bikes.
Scariest moment in my life on a bike was in Senegal going down these roads at 80, 90, 100 miles an hour with these bushes that are this tall on each side, and there's animals running out in front of you. Pigs and ostriches.
You're just thinking, "God, don't step out in front of my front wheel."
That's terrifying.
It scared me to death. I hit a cow at 80 miles an hour.
You hit a cow?
I've bounced off the hoods of cars.
That would mess you up.
I could tell stories.
How's it going, guys? Do you guys all ride electric bikes now?
Do you?
I have ridden some before.
Yeah?
I ride my own motorcycles mostly.
What do you have?
Got a Harley and a couple dirt bikes.
Everybody loves everything around here, yeah.
Have you gone on one yet?
We're about to try one.
Yeah? Sick, dude. I hope you like it.
Yeah, I'm excited. Nice to meet you, dude.
Yeah, it's a pleasure.
How's it going, man?
Good. Since you're here.
: 
Uh-oh.
No way.
This is from "The Walking Dead."
That's rad.
So...
(laughs)
Big fan of yours.
Thanks, man.
Have you guys ever thought about doing an electric dune buggy?
I want a hat.
All right.
Great Frog!
Whoo!
That's when I had short hair. That was way back when.
I feel like I'm the only person whose never (bleep) seen this show.
I need to watch it.
Get out of here right now.
(laughter)
Bye, guys. Go to work.
Go to work.
: 
Okay, I want to see if I can touch the ground.
Try it out.
See what fits you best. What's your favorite color? What's your favorite flavor?
: 
That's an off-road trail bike, yeah.
I'm taking this one.
This is the FXS.
It's very lightweight.
: 
: 
I think you'll really like that one.
All the stuff's where you'd normally expect.
Your turn signal's here.
Okay.
Brake where you'd normally expect it. Foot brake.
And then the last thing you do to arm this thing is hit the throttle switch.
Okay.
Now that means this bike is running right now.
Wow. Wait, so it's on already?
It's running right now?
It's running right now.
Shut up. Wow.
Wow.
Away you go.
Ah!
I think we've chosen our weapons.
Let's go out and give them a whirl.
All right.
All right?
Cool.
I can't believe that that was running while we were standing there.
: 
: 
I think so.
: 
Whoa.
This is so crazy.
Yeah, this is nuts.
: 
I'm just... this is blowing me away how smooth this is.
It's like your ass is sliding on ice.
(laughs)
Santa Cruz redwoods.
Hi.
Oh, (bleep)!
I just creeped up on you and you had no idea.
No, I didn't. I was like, "Where's Norman?"
: 
It smells really fresh.
It does.
Healthy and green up here.
Like mossy.
: 
I mean, it's perfect really for, like, going through this beautiful forest.
You're just kind of gliding.
I kind of feel like this is the future.
I really do.
Yeah, imagine in, like, 50 or 100 years when, like, cities are smogged up, everything will be electric.
Whee! This is crazy 'cause I can't see the bike.
Does it feel like you're flying?
Yeah, it does.
(laughs)
: 
Amazing.
: 
Whoa!
Have you put it in sport mode?
Yeah, dude, it's like, oh, my God.
It's terrifying.
: 
Whoa! Whoa! I put it in sport. It's crazy.
You feel the extra tug. It's like, whaa!
I swallowed my Adam's apple for a second.
It was great riding with your guys.
You're awesome.
Thank you so much, Scot.
Imogen, it was really nice meeting you.
I want an electric motorcycle now.
Yeah, me, too.
We got more converts. That's cool.
Cool.
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, tell me.
This belonged to my late brother Chris.
He was a huge, huge fan of yours.
Used to have posters of you guys up in the room and everything.
Oh, man.
He loved you guys a lot.
And this was actually in the wreck with him.
That's why it's all mangled like this.
Oh, dude.
I wanted to see if you could sign it. It would mean the world to me.
Come here. Come here. Yeah, dude.
Thanks, man.
Of course.
Sign it to Chris if you would.
To Chris.
Of course, man.
It was a pleasure to meet you, man.
You, too, man.
Thanks for coming.
Yeah, dude. Yeah. Be well, dude.
Ride on.
Yeah. Take care, man.
Bye.
: 
: 
Yeah, it's really cute here.
: 
This is cool. Look at this wall.
: 
Hi. Oh, shut up, hi.
Good to see you.
Nice to see you, too.
Congratulations.
Do you live up here?
Yes, this is where I live.
Shut up.
You guys know each other?
Shut up. How are you, dude?
Nice to see you, sweetheart. Yeah, what a pleasure.
That lady that just said hi, she was a director on "Walking Dead."
What a small world. Santa Cruz.
She's awesome.
Still have to watch it.
I'm gonna send you every disc.
Okay.
Then I'll send you like a little... you'll have to write an essay or something.
How long have you been riding?
How did you get started riding motorcycles?
I'm into riding because of my dad.
I used to hitch a ride on the back of his bike to university and to work.
He had a BMW Dakar dual-sport thing, and I would jump on the back of that.
And now it's carried on as the inspiration as to why I love to ride.
It's because of my dad.
He died, like, a year and a half ago.
So whenever I ride, it's like... my special time.
Yeah.
That cross-country trip was, like, the one-year anniversary of his death.
I remember.
So it was very, very special thing to have happen.
I like how your family... you pass the torch from... like how you do your rings and the store.
Unintentionally, but, yes.
It's great.
People don't have that. It's great.
I like that they have shrubberies everywhere.
A shrubbery.
Shrubbery.
Do you like Monty Python?
Oh, my God, I love Monty Python.
"Monty Python and the Holy Grail" is my favorite movie of all time.
With the little rabbit?
Yeah.
It goes after his throat.
"We are the Knights that say Ni."
Exactly.
(motors revving)
It's nice to be back on my own bike.
Yeah, I agree.
Kind of like the rumble, but those bikes were cool, I got to say.
I like how he said, too, he's not trying to replace other motorcycles.
Yeah.
: 
I like Santa Cruz.
Welcome to "Motorcycles & Misfits" at the Re-Cycle Garage.
You guys are getting all Batman on me and stuff.
(laughs)
I'm gonna tell you, and you're not gonna like my answer.
: 
: 
Northern California is so much different than Southern California.
It's different, yeah.
It's such a different energy. You know what I mean?
: 
Hello.
What's up? Hi.
I'm Norman.
Liza.
Nice to meet you. Hi.
Hi. Imogen.
Hey, Imogen.
Nice to meet you.
These are some nice little rides you got.
This is a little bit nicer version than mine, but you know.
This is awesome, though. That's beautiful.
Thank you.
Did you really? Right on.
Yes.
Do you teach people that don't know how to work on bikes how to work on bikes?
Yes, but nobody here is a mechanic.
Oh, wow.
We teach people how to ride, help them buy their gear, teach them what are the cool movies to watch.
Expose them to the entire culture.
How cool.
Yeah, so we've kind of built up this crazy community.
: 
: 
How did the podcast start?
When you get a group of people sitting around the garage 
Wow, that's so cool.
So we thought, "How can we bottle this 
We're ready.
Check, one, two.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Hey, there. Welcome to "Motorcycles & Misfits" at the Re-Cycle Garage here in...
: ...sunny Santa Cruz, California.
Warm and sunny.
: 
What's the best bike for the zombie apocalypse?
And we have a special guest here.
Somebody who actually has experience in this field, and I want to get their opinion.
What's up? What's up? What's up?
Hi, thanks for having me.
Hey, dude. Welcome.
I'm gonna tell you, and I think you're not gonna like my answer.
Oh, yeah?
 is I'd get one of these Zero bikes, and I would put a solar panel on the back of it.
(laughing)
'Cause anything that makes noise attracts zombies.
Right? And I caught a lot of flack for having that Triumph with the ape hangers.
I caught a lot of flack, and then I built another bike, miraculously in, like, six hours on that show.
And I get a lot of flack because that one makes a lot of noise as well.
How did you come to have that bike?
That's supposed to be Merle's bike.
Did he customize the frame up that high?
I guess. I don't know. What the (bleep)?
Um...
So I would like to make some suggestions.
Uh-oh, here we go.
First you should consider an anti-theft device of some kind.
Oh, I like it.
Just saying.
Second, more mirrors, I would suggest.
It would be nice to maybe see something coming up behind you.
Yeah, I... yeah.
Lastly, a machine gun on the front because what bike isn't cooler with a machine gun on the front?
Yeah, we've thought about attaching weapons to that thing.
You could just drill a hole in your exhaust and squirt some soap in it and make a smokescreen.
You guys are getting all Batman on me and stuff.
How's motorcycling changed you?
: 
Like, I ride to work every day and I think about what I'm about to do and it really gets me in the mood.
And then I ride home. I think about what I did.
I don't know. It's almost like yoga or something at some point.
You know what I mean?
: 
: 
I gave an award at the Country Music Awards in Nashville when I was down in Georgia and, you know, they booked me a flight to go there and everything.
And I'm sitting there watering my plants and I'm looking at my bike, and I'm watering my plants, and I said, "(bleep) it." And I grabbed the suit, I shoved it in a backpack, wrote all my directions on my arm.
And then I kept going through rainstorms, and I just kept losing them.
(snoring)
Is your dog snoring right now? Is that what that was?
Oh, my God, that's adorable.
: 
 and thank you guys for joining us.
: 
I was looking for a group ride when I first moved here, and I ran into Zach.
He had a crappy motorcycle but a nice jacket, so I asked him...

I was like, "So where's the ride?"
And I asked him if they could show me how to change my oil.
And this is where we are now.

That was three years ago.
Nice.
When I fist showed up, Liza just shoved a broken moped at me and was like, "Here, fix this."
That's how she hooks you in. She's like, "Oh, here's this free bike.
Just get it running and it's yours."
And two years later, I was still here.
That's cool.
And she's all, "Hey, Dad," when she was 13, "I want to ride motorcycles." I'm all, "Hell, no."
And she's like, "Whatever. I'll be 18 someday." I'm like, "Ugh, yeah."
So you guys are father and daughter? That is so cool.
Yeah, so then I started hanging around.
And then I just got hooked.
 and everything melts away.
Yeah.

Let's saddle up and do a quick ride.
Shall we hit it?

This is really cool.
Bye, guys.
