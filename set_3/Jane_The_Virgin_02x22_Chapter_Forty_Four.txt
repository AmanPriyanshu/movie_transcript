: So, here we are. After the mother of all love triangles, Jane finally chose Michael. And the wedding was supposed to be in the Villanueva house, only it flooded. So Rogelio rebuilt the house on the soundstage of his telenovela. Sweet, right? Not as sweet: Xiomara slept with Rogelio's nemesis, Esteban.
Look, I-I made a huge mistake.
: And poor Rafael. You see, he lost Jane. Oh, and his mom turned out to be a crime lord. And his stepmother Rose is one too. Or, she was. Yup. That's Raf's sister Luisa. And, well, Rose was the love of her life. Until she met Michael's partner Susanna.
You need to go back to rehab.
So that when you're out I can take you out.
: And speaking of complicated love lives, Rafael's other baby mama, Petra, still has feelings for him. And her long-lost twin Anezka was encouraging her.
I think he is starting to love you again.
Oh, and Anezka is also epileptic. And honestly, there are a million other things happening.
But we have a wedding to get to already, so let's go!
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva was a young girl there was one story she loved to be told over and over again.
Go on.
: The same veil that your mother wore?
Your shoe!
[crack] [people gasp]
[indistinct chatter]
: To young Jane, it was the greatest love story ever told.
: And that day... is tomorrow!
We... we should stop.
[sighs heavily]
One more day.
Just one more day.
35 hours, 17 minutes, but who's counting?
Seriously. I can't wait...
For all the s*x? Yeah, I get that.
To marry you.
[sighing]: Oh.
[wedding bells ringing]
[sighs] ‭Do we really have to go out there?
One more day.
Just one more day.
Yes, Charo, playing when Mateo comes down the aisle.
I have to go. Florist on line two.
Jane, Michael, I have a hundred things to run by you! No!
I can't be at the church early.
Everyone knows that it's customary for the father of the bride to drive the bride to the ceremony. Hello, are you awake?
Hello? Wake up! Hello?!
Dad, stop, stop.
You can't talk like that to the florist!
Oh, it's fine.
She and I, we like to banter a little. Anyway, you're just in time for Mateo's practice session.
Because, after all, we cannot have a ring bearer cry in the middle of the ceremony.
Mateo will be fine.
And you need to take a few deep breaths, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that the wedding is finally here.
Go for Rogelio.
I really, really can't wait for our honeymoon.
Oh, my God.
What?
I forgot to change the reservation after the wedding moved up.
What?
I reminded you.
I meant to, but it's just been a crazy week, starting the job again.
Yeah, I get that. Of course, it's been a really crazy week for me too, trying to change my thesis. And I still was able to call everyone personally and explain to them why we moved the wedding, and I rebooked people's hotels, and I cancelled the rehearsal dinner.
I know, and I'm gonna fix this.
We're gonna have somewhere to stay on our wedding night that is not here, with my family, at Rafael's hotel?
Yes. Absolutely.
Great.
: Sounds great.
Okay, I'll see you soon.
Your sister?
You had your Luisa voice.
Yeah.
She is on her way.
Hopefully in good shape, 'cause I could really use a break from family drama right now.
: Ah, yes. You'll recall Rafael's family drama had recently taken a turn for the bonkers, even by Solano family standards.
How do you feel?
Well, I'm glad my mother's in jail.
Now I just want them to find my brother.
Yeah.
But I asked how do you feel?
Not great.
It's all a little much sometimes, you know?
It's Jane.
I'm sorry, I got to go, it's urgent.
Are you okay, is everything okay?
Yes, yes, you just have to see this!
Raf's here, Mom put him down.
Okay, are you watching, are you ready?
Yes. For what? ‭
Mateo, come here. Show Daddy.
Come here.
‭RAFAEL: Oh, my God, he's walking! He's...
Can you believe it?
No, I can't bel...
This is amazing!
I know, I know. He just...
He was pushing the wagon, and then he let go.
: Behold, the most amazing and coordinated boy in human history.
And just in time to walk down the aisle.
[sighs] Okay, I got to run. I just wanted you to see that.
No, no, thank you for texting. Where are you going, by the way?
To meet with my advisor. I'm trying to change my thesis.
The one you were trying to get approved forever?
Yeah. I-I just realized that my heart is not in it.
But, you know, it may be too late to make a change.
Unless somebody else tells me that they loved me.
Wait, what?
I said unless my professor okays it.
Okay.
Bye, Mr. Sweetface.
My little walker.
Oh, the places you'll go. [Giggling]
: And speaking of big milestones.
Congratulations. Glad you're back on the force.
Thank you, sir. Oh, hey, did you ever find out who leaked the details about the Sin Rostro investigation to the press?
We're working on that.
Now go. Enjoy your wedding.
It's got to be him. He's the only one who had access to all the information.
[horn honking]
So you... you're still together?
I know, it's weird.
Actually, I was wondering if she could be my plus one to your wedding.
Oh. I mean... Uh... Forget it.
It's weird. ‭Uh, well, let me just...
I'll ask Jane.
'Cause, you know, Luisa... accidentally inseminated her and all.
Yeah. Of course. I get it.
That's what Jane just said.
Be quiet! Oh, no, not you. Her.
Okay, no more excuses. We are less than 24 hours till go time. [Gasps]
Okay, well, tell Bruno Mars if he doesn't confirm, I'm cutting him from the wedding lineup.
Yes, I know he played the "Super Bowl".
Tell him this is the Super Bowl of weddings.
Hey, did you ever get a firm answer from Dina?
Oh, she can't make it, she needs to get all her work done before the strike.
Okay. Well, you know, if that changes, just let me know and we'll squeeze her in.
Don't you give me attitude!
What? ‭
Not you. Her.
Relax, relax.
Yeah, no, no, not you. You don't relax, you do the opposite of relaxing.
[doorbell rings]
Yeah, well, Rise above and all that.
Xiomara Villanueva?
This is from...
I can see who it's from!
Xiomara?
Nothing.
Okay. I-I might have... spent the night with Esteban.
It was a mistake and I told him to back off, but he won't.
Xiomara!
Look...
No one can know about this. Especially...
[phone rings]
: Oh, I was gonna say Rogelio.
But yeah, Jane would be pissed too.
Hi, hon.
How was the meeting?
Oh, not great. Donaldson says I can't change my thesis without submitting something else.
And I don't know what I do want to write about.
Maybe it's for the best?
So you can focus on the wedding?
Yeah, maybe.
Anyway, don't forget to bring my shoes to the rehearsal.
And don't be late.
I won't. And we won't be late, don't worry.
Sorry.
It's just... this is the important part, you know?
Like, the actual sacrament of marriage.
And I just really want it to go well.
It will, don't worry.
[exhales] Okay. Bye.
[gasps]
Why do you have a s*x basket from my mortal enemy?
[scoffs] That's not a s*x basket.
I know a s*x basket when I see one.
It was just once.
It meant nothing.
: Which brings us here, now.
Sorry again, they should be here any minute. [Chuckles]
As long as this doesn't happen tomorrow.
Since we accommodated your last-minute schedule change, we have a very limited window.
Oh, I-I know, absolutely. And you know what they say... bad rehearsal, great wedding.
Some good news, at least.
The Biltmore had a last-minute cancellation.
Guess who scored the presidential suite?
Whoa.
‭Yeah.
Wait, how much did that cost?
Like 1,700 bucks.
What?
‭Yeah.
That is, like, half of our budget for our honeymoon.
Why didn't you consult with me?
Consult you?
We're getting married.
So, what, I got to consult you every time I want to spend money now?
That much, yes.
Hi there, hi.
Sorry we're late.
Good, we can start, let's start.
Sounds good. Uh, first, hi, everyone.
You told me to fix this. I'm sorry I didn't ask you exactly how to fix it.
Don't be sarcastic.
First, welcome, everyone, to this joyous occasion.
Let's-let's get everyone lined up.
Jane, who's walking you down the aisle?
Oh, my-my parents and my grandma.
Okay.
Okay, let's go.
[exclaims softly] Oh...
Oops... looks like we might need to narrow down to two.
: Good luck.
I agree. Xiomara, you should move to the rear.
Excuse me?
It's only right.
Oh, don't you start.
Me start, me start?
Guys, what's going on?
I'm not the one who slept with the devil!
: And friends, that's when Jane's newly-mobile son took off.
Oh, no, Mateo!
Mateo, no! Oh, oh! [Shrieks]
: On the bright side, if bad rehearsals really do make good weddings, this is going to be the best wedding ever.
We are so sorry, Father.
We've just been under so much pressure.
‭I'm fine.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm sorry, Jane. I shouldn't have said anything.
So, so sorry.
I was so mad.
[Xiomara sighs] ROGELIO: Why are you moving your-your head like this?
What? ‭What?
'Cause you two are not fighting the night before my wedding.
After my wedding, you two can kill each other, but before my wedding, everyone gets along.
Got it?
[sighs heavily]
Oh. I'm so sorry.
No, I should have consulted you.
I... I just got defensive 'cause I ruined our honeymoon.
Oh. ‭I'll cancel the fancy hotel.
No. No.
‭lt's happening.
[Mateo crying] ‭Ah.
It feels weird, leaving...
It's fine. I'll see you tomorrow.
Mm-hmm.
And then, every day for the rest of our lives.
I love you.
I love you, too.
: Rafael just runs to her. I mean, when will it end? ‭
Tomorrow.
The sun always coming out tomorrow.
When he sees Jane being married, which is why you must be there.
I already don't even know if I should go at this point.
No, you must.
: Hmm.
Why is it so important to her?
For future relationship with Jane.
And because when-when Rafael sees her marrying someone else, he will need comfort... from you.
No. No, I told him I don't want him if he's in love with someone else.
And I meant it.
I mean it, Raf. I am committed to my sobriety.
And to earning your trust back.
And this thing with Susanna... is it serious?
Yes. [Laughs]
But it's different than any relationship I've had.
We haven't even had s*x, just light hand play, because she wants to get to know each other first.
So how are you?
: Where to begin?
Still love Jane.
: Direct, to the point.
She's the love of my life.
And yes, I know, she's getting married.
I don't know. Maybe if I tell her.
If there's even the slightest chance she won't walk down the aisle, then I have to.
I mean, right?
: And friends, knowing Luisa as he did, he fully expected her to say...
Don't do it.
: Not that.
Trust me, I get it.
I thought I would never love again the way that I loved Rose.
But, then I met Susanna, and now...
I'm starting to feel the same exact way.
And you will, too.
Just let Jane go.
Hun, let it go. So you fought.
It's not that.
There's just so much we haven't talked about. Basic stuff.
Marriage stuff. Tomorrow's just the wedding.
And the rehearsal was a disaster.
What if tomorrow's awful?
What?
: The man she lost her virginity to.
But it was perfect.
The shoes, the veil...
[audience gasping, murmuring]
So, the veil I'm wearing tomorrow...?
[gasps]
[laughter]
[phone chimes]
Oh, man. ‭Oh!
It's Michael.
[sighs]
: Three times a week?
At Abuela's? That's-that's a lot.
But how about two dinners a week?
Minimum.
36 hours is my maximum for dirty dishes to stay.
Done.
And now for item 23.
I know it's a big one.
[sighs]
When do we want to have another kid?
[magical tinkling]
: Aw, look, they're having all the feels.
[magical tinkling] LATIN LOVER
: All three of them.
[sighs]
Abuela.
[Jane gasps]
: And dear viewer, that's when it hit her!
I know what my new thesis should be.
It's a love story loosely based on my grandparents.
It'll start in Venezuela and explore class differences, religion, sexual stigma, their journey to America.
Jane...
I can even make it bilingual even.
Jane, it sounds wonderful, but...
Don't tell me it's too late.
The committee is meeting right now.
There's no time to write a new proposal.
Please. I can't spend an entire year working on something I'm not passionate about.
You know what? Just come in now.
Pitch the idea in person.
: Remember, Jane, she hates the marriage plot.
I have... a... thing.
Well, you're just gonna have to decide if your thing is more important than your thesis.
[sighs] JANE: And it's on the way.
And I will make it to our wedding with time to spare, but I will not go if you are not okay with it.
: You're on your way, aren't you?
I am, yes, but I am ready and willing to go back upstairs if you say no.
Go! But don't be late.
I won't. I won't. I love you.
[elevator bell dings]
Give me! ‭Okay. ‭Go!
: Hey.
Sorry. I got here as fast as I could.
That's a lot of makeup.
Yes. I know. Should we go in?
: Oh, man, I hope it goes well.
: It went great, Ma!
The committee said yes right away.
I'm so excited.
Ugh! What am I doing wrong?
These buttons aren't closing.
I don't know. I can't see. Turn around.
Oh, it's crooked.
This one? ‭
Nope.
Here?
‭No, no, no.
That's not it. More to the left. Hey...
Then this one?
‭No. More, more.
No, don't just keep saying "more," Ma.
Th-That one!
I can't reach that one!
It's right... It...
I told you I had a thing.
Call you back, Ma.
Why am I not surprised?
Look, I don't want to be late. Can you help me?
Yeah.
Oh, good.
These are... these are tiny.
I know. [Laughs]
I feel like I'm locking you into the patriarchy as I do this.
Well, I appreciate you doing it anyway.
Okay.
‭Ah!
Good. Go. And, hey, congratulations.
On your new thesis being approved.
Thanks.
[panting]
We're on our way, Michael, eight minutes away.
I love you, too.
How did it go?
Success! They loved it.
Ooh! Ooh!
[panting] Oh!
Okay. ‭Why is it so cold in here?
I left the car running with the air conditioner on so your makeup wouldn't run from the heat.
Oh, thanks, Dad. [Engine revving]

Oh, you don't understand.
My is daughter is getting married.
Yeah.
17 stops. Take a seat.
Oh, we're still 16 stops away. I'm so sorry.
I love you, too.
[sighs]
Michael's gonna try and stall until we get there. Dad?
: Huh. He's staring with an intensity of disdain he reserves only for...
Welcome to the sexiest bus in Miami!
: Where is the bride?
You know we have a very limited window for the ceremony.
She'll be here soon. We'll just talk fast.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, fine.
: I'm fine.
Totally fine.
He doesn't seem fine.
Come on, let's talk.
It'll take my mind off the fact that I'm... officially late to my wedding.
I mean, I understand your mother needed to move on, but she could have slept with anyone.
Why would she pick the one person who would hurt me the most?
Well, I guess that's kind of the point, right?
I mean, she was obviously really hurt that you moved on so quickly with Dina.
She... she just wanted to hurt you back.
[sighs]
Yes. Okay, that makes sense.
Plus, she clearly has a type. ‭What?
Because you and Esteban are so similar.
[Rogelio gasps, Esteban gasps]
: We could not be more different!
Come on, put Esteban out of your head, okay?
This is your big day!
And mine.
[grunting]
[panting]
[gasps, grunting]
Jane, please stop running. Your makeup will melt.
Let me carry you!
No way!
Then your ‭makeup will melt!
You're right! We'll reapply when we get there!
[panting, groaning]
Shoes.
[shuddering breath]
[chuckles] ‭Thanks, Dad.
Yeah.
Okay. ‭Oh.
Okay, go inside and tell Michael I'm here so he doesn't see me.
On it!
[sighs sharply]
: And that's when she saw him.
[hinges squeak]
Mr. Sweetface!
[laughing]: Hi.
Baby.
Oh.
[kisses]
Oh.
I was just keeping him occupied.
You look so handsome I can't stand it!
: And in this moment, friends, Rafael was sure, absolutely sure, that Jane was about to marry the wrong man.
Anhe was also sure that it was now or never.
Jane?
I know this is terrible timing, but it's kind of like what you were saying about your writing.
Sometimes you can be really far down the road, but you still have to follow your heart.
What are you talking about?
I love you, Jane.
I always have.
And I always will.
And I think we're supposed to be together.
So if there's even the smallest part of your heart that believes this to be true, then... don't marry Michael.
Please don't marry him.
: And it was true, friends... he did love her.
And he saw she was happy.
So how could he ruin that?
Which is why he said nothing. Ah.
Are you ready to walk down the aisle, Mr. Sweetface?
Yes?
I'll take him inside.
Ah...
[sighs] Good luck.
[sighs]
You look beautiful.

But keep talking to her. She knows you're here.
Can I, uh... can I have a moment alone with my sister?
Of course.
I'm outside if you need me, okay?
[sighs]
[accented]: Don't worry, beautiful sister.
I do what is necessary to taking good care of Rafael.
: I should explain...
Baby has your sense of humor, laughing at other's tears!
Oh. I wonder if this also will make her laugh.

: Poor Petra!
My friends, it seems she's been...
[indistinct chatter]
: Aw, there they go.
[phone chimes]
Xiomara, I know you said you don't want to see me again, but perhaps this will change your mind.
[gasps]
I feel sick.
: Me too. Let's get out of here.
Much better.
Okay, we're about nine minutes away from Motel 6. Six if I speed.
Four if I use my siren.
I can't wait.
: I venture to guess that no two people have ever been this excited to spend the night at a Motel 6.
What's that? ‭
Oh.
It's a gift for you. I was gonna give it to you later.
[gasps]
‭But now's good.

Now it's snowing on the yacht.
Snow makes everything more romantic.

: We first kissed in the snow.
This way it's snowing on us forever.
Do you want a drink? Or a... a water?
I just really don't want to be alone right now.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I thought you said you didn't want to do this if I'm not over Jane.
And I'm not.
And I don't care anymore.
: Well, that's an about face.
Yeah. Everything's fine.
: I warned you.
I told you I bust out of condoms.
: I can't believe it. It's Michael and Jane.
They're finally doing it!
Oh, no. It's Rafael and Petra!
I mean, Anezka!
Yeah. Leapin' lizards, indeed!
[panting] Oh. We should probably... We should... we sh... we should leave. Or stay.
Yes. That's a genius idea.
Oh. Wait, wait, wait. I had a whole plan.
[panting]
Put that on right now.
Yes, Officer.
Oh.
I'm gonna go get some ice for the champagne.
Don't go anywhere.
I won't.
[door shuts] [exhales]
Which brings us here, now...
Hey. ‭Hey. Congratulations, Michael.
It was a really beautiful wedding.
Thank you.
Oh, um, Tuscaloosa. Roll Tide.
Hmm?
Roll Tide. Then you say...
: Roll.
Go Crimson?
Oh, right. Yeah. I've heard that.
: This is your new partner, Susanna Barnett. From Tuscaloosa.
Pleased to meet you.
: Tell her Roll Tide.
She'll get it.
You know who used blue silk ties?
A drug lord that went by the name Mutter. Look it up.
Cordero's got a direct line to Nadine.
Let's fire him, make a big show of it, then he can embed himself with Nadine, see where it leads.
The chip. That's what this is all about.
So where is it?
It was on me. Literally.
Tech decoded that flash drive with the criminals whose faces were changed by Mutter and Sin Rostro.
And at a million bucks a pop, that's $200 million unaccounted for.
[gasps]
It's you.
You're the mole. You've been leading us to Mutter this whole time. Why?
Who are you working for?
Oh!
So, we need to leave right now.
Why?
[gasping]
You said you didn't think you could ever love again, not the way you loved Rose.
I never stopped loving you, Luisa.
And you never stopped loving me.
But you were dead.
I-I s... I-I saw you.
That wasn't me.
That was just to free us.
So now we can go anywhere.
Don't look so surprised.
You know ours is the greatest love story ever told.
Now, come on. It's time to go.
: And, friends, she's right. It is.
