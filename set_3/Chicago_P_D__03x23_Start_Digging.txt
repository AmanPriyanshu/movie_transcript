It's my son's birthday, Pop.

[indistinct radio chatter]
Hey, Sarge.
We got one dead female... found in the trunk.
A park district employee was closing the gates.
He was about to have the car towed when he noticed blood on the rear of the car and called the police.
Victim's hands and feet are tied with barbed wire.
Throat's cut. Fingernails are gone, too.
I'm guessing she fought back against the assailant.
He knew there'd be DNA, so he yanked them off.
Cartel hit?
Or Russians.
They've been known to use barbed wire too.
Mouse ran a work-up.
Car's registered to the victim.
Her name's Melissa Wilds.
She's 26 years old.
We got an address.
All right, call Ruzek and Olinsky.
Tell them to go over there and do a knock-and-talk.
[banging on door]
I'll call in for a warrant.
What's going on?
We're the police. Who are you, ma'am?
Tricia Reynolds.
I'm Melissa's friend.
Um, I've been waiting up for her to get home.
This is her daughter, Tigan.
Did something happen?
[door opens]
Where's Mommy?
Tricia, is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine, Mom.
Tricia, you think your mom could take Tigan inside, please?
Yeah.
When's Mommy coming home?
She'll be home soon.
Come on, sweetie.
We found Melissa about an hour ago.
She's been murdered.
Oh, my God.
Tricia, did Melissa say where she was going tonight, or...
No, um, she just said she had to meet someone, so she asked me to watch Tigan for her.
Where's Tigan's father?
Peter?
Yeah.
Um, he... he was in the Army.
He died, um, in an accident last year.
[sighs]
All right, we're gonna need you to come down to district, just answer a few questions... call Tigan's next of kin.
But who would want to hurt her?
That's what we're gonna find out.
[solemn music]
Sir. Commander.
Sergeant, please have a seat.
[door closes]
This meeting's like a coin flip.
Am I getting a department commendation or the firing squad?
Sergeant, as you know, the department is under intense scrutiny.
Charges of racial profiling, excessive use of force, deadly shootings... public trust and morale are at critical points.
The new superintendent's trying to fix that.
Good.
Implementing new programs, new strategies... strategies that might not fit with your "old school" approach.
Well, I'm not a stats guy, but I'm pretty sure my unit has the highest clear rate of any organized crime division.
And we know the credit for that goes mostly to you.
It's a team effort.
Which brings us to why you're here.
We're promoting you to lieutenant.
I didn't take the lieutenant's exam.
It's a meritorious promotion.
You're one of the most respected supervisors in the field.
Instead of a six-man unit, you'll be in charge of 50.
Instill your years of knowledge onto them.
There's also a substantial salary increase.
So all those times you guys tried to put paper on me, take away my star, question my methods... it's all forgotten?
Why don't we just call this what it is?
Part of this new policy is taking proactive cops off the street.
I think "proactive" is putting it politely, Sergeant.
[cell phone buzzing]
And regardless of how you see this, we strongly recommend that you accept.
May I please be excused?
You have 48 hours to give us your answer.
Thank you, Commander.
Gentlemen.
Melissa Wilds.
Her husband was an Army private... killed in a training exercise last year at Fort Bragg, along with three others, when their chopper went down.
She had an associate's from Roosevelt and worked as a paralegal for the law firm Sawyer & Sawyer.
Yeah, I've seen those commercials.
They're just high-profile ambulance chasers.
Bigger than that.
They do seven-figure class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies or schools with asbestos.
Yo, except for a few parking tickets, Melissa has zero priors.
She's a working, widowed mom, so the more I'm digging here, I can't see any reason why she'd be associated with cartels or any Russians.
Melissa.
This girl was tortured with barbed wire.
That means the killer either wanted something from her, or it was personal.
So I want to know where she was before we found her, who she was with... if she was seeing someone new.
Hey, look who's here.
Oh, there he is.
Hey, hey.
Last day, huh?
Yep, this is it.

We worked a class action suit last year.
Several dozen plaintiffs were awarded mesothelioma cancer pay-outs, all over a million dollars each.
After the checks were mailed out, three of the plaintiffs were robbed in home invasions... some of them badly injured.

Melissa's father said she and Bingham dated six years ago back in high school.
