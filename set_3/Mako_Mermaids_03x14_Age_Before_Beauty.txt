Now I focus on the center of the ball and...
See? It's simple.
We already did water balls.
: Revision never hurt anyone, Amaris.
You have to practice until your powers are second nature.
Now, does anyone know how to shrink it?
How about this?
Principal Santos?
Evie. What can I do for you?
Um... 
 Oh, don't worry, you look busy.
Oh, no. It's just admin stuff.
It never seems to end.
Do you miss teaching?
You were one of my favorites.
Thank you, Evie.
And now, what do you need?
Good afternoon, Principal Santos.
Good afternoon, Ms. Trumble.
Evie.
Can I help you?
No, no.
I was just wondering if you were looking forward to the weekend?
I always enjoy the weekend.
I was referring to tomorrow's review of your position as principal.
Of course.
I've been so busy, it slipped my mind.
I'm surprised you're taking such a casual approach to such a serious matter.
I do indeed regard it as serious.
So do I.
In fact... I'm putting myself forward for the position.
Evie. 
: I'm a good teacher.
: Yes, you are.
I'm careful. I make sure they get the basics right.
Yes, you do.
So why are they giving me such a hard time?
I'm sure you never did that to your teachers.
Maybe you need to challenge them.
Be inventive.
Show them something special that will encourage them to learn.
Like what?
The accelerated growth spell.
 Yes.
I used to love this when I was little.
I'm sure your class will too.
With a little moon ring magic...
Fijian seaweed becomes... instant growth accelerator.
Now comes the fun part.
Place a bulb in water, then we add...
Can I do it?
: And now we add the growth accelerator... to speed up the plant's life cycle.
Even Amaris is going to love this.
That's it. My homework is done.
Now it's just you and me for the entire evening.
And don't forget the most important thing.
Mmm-hmm?
Pizza.
Oh, you are such a romantic.
: Knock, knock.
Not disturbing you, am I?
No, of course not. Come in.
I got these for you.
Tertiary course guides.
Well, you've got to start thinking about what you want to study next year.
I can't wait to read them.
Uh, Dr. Blakely... is Rita gonna be the principal next year?
Why do you ask?
Well, you're the chairman of the school board, and I heard it's her review tomorrow.
Well, the board is very pleased with her work.
And between you and me... all Rita has to do is turn up and the job is hers.
 Mmm.
: It's Saturday, Rita.
You're not going to school?
My job review's at 2:30 so I thought I'd go in early and get some work done.
Would you like some tea?
I've just made some.
Mmm, thank you.
: What took you so long? I've been waiting for ages.
 Nothing like a swim to the reef to wake you up.
I would have won if you hadn't gone before I finished counting down.
Did anyone say life was fair?
Oh...
I can't wait to show these little mermaids they don't know everything.
Where did you put the growth accelerator?
I thought I put it here.
Oh, here it is.
: You want tea? I'll make some more.
 You made tea with this?
Yeah, I just made a cup for Rita.
Bad tea.
Ah, you guys look pretty chilled.
We worked hard for it.
Homework done, every conceivable chore completed.
Nothing to do for the rest of the day but relax.
I could always use a hand cleaning.
Sorry, David.
There's a patch of sand on the beach with our names on it.
Speaking of the beach... shall we?
Oh.
Evie, you know that cute little sundress you showed me yesterday?
I really think I want it.
We were just about to go, Carly.
Can I try it on?
It'll just take a sec. Please, please, please?
Not a bad looking old duck, am I?
How could you do this?
I didn't know what that stuff was.
The jars look exactly the same.
How am I supposed to know which one has the real tea in it?
At least we have until Monday to undo this.
Uh... actually, we don't.
Rita has her job review at 2:30.
That's in three hours.
Oh, great.
 We need a reversal potion.
Mimmi, you can do that.
No, I can't.
What do you mean you can't? You know all the potions.
No, I don't.
Uh... I do.
Now, uh... What was it?
 Oh, no.
No, that's not it.
Uh... mmm, give me a minute.
Uh...
You should see your faces.
I'm kidding. I'll tell you what you need.
Sea grass, green algae, red algae, sea sponges and, uh... sea slug slime.
: Mmm-hmm.
Is that all we need?
Rita?
Hmm?
What?
The ingredients for the reversal potion?
Yes, that's right, and don't forget the kelp.
We need kelp too?
Of course we need kelp.
How can you make a potion without kelp?
We divide up the list, we should be able to find the stuff in no time.
Mmm.
Can I not do the sea slug thing?
I have a problem with slime.
: Excuse me?
Could someone get me a glass of water?
I... I don't fancy those stairs on my own.
Maybe I should stay and watch her.
Good luck with that.
Can I get you anything else?
A blanket would be nice.
And may I say what a lovely grotto you have.
Um... 
 actually, it's your...
Got you again.
You're early, Ms. Trumble.
Your interview isn't until 3:30.
I'm quite aware, Dr. Blakely.
I left home early in case of motor accidents on the highway.
This interview is very important to me.
Your commitment is commendable, Ms. Trumble.
Happy?
Mmm-hmm.
Might be time for an ice cream though.
Does your stomach ever take a break?
: Hi, guys. Carly told me you'd be here.
Now that I've left the caf√© business, I'm thinking about going into a new one... a juice bar, actually on the beach.
Cam--
: I know, it's a great idea.
I've come up with a list of names...
...see which one you guys like the best.
Juiced, Juicerama, Surf Juice.
Not doing it for you? I've got more.
"Juice Junction, Juice-em-up."
What about... "Every Which Way But Juice"?
Where are you going?
I'd like to sit in the sun.
Well, I don't think that's a good idea in your, um... condition.
Really?
But I thought it might help me remember the final ingredient for the reversal potion.
There's a final ingredient?
Oh, I don't know, dear. Is there?
Let's talk about it outside, in the sun.
: 
Two worlds so close together, but... so different.
It's amazing.
Now, about that final ingredient.
I thought if I could live here and learn about land people...
I might help us understand each other.
But you never went back to the sea.
Oh, I thought about it... but I enjoyed what I was doing here and...
Well, the years went by... so quickly.
Do you regret not going back?
No.
No, it's been a fulfilling life.
And I might never have met you.
It appears Principal Santos has been delayed.
We'll see you now, Ms. Trumble.
We got everything.
Well, not quite.
There's another ingredient.
Rita's been holding out on us.
: Naughty Rita...
: Where did she...
I just wanted to see if I could still do that.
Stop fooling around, Rita.
We need to reverse this so we can get you to the interview.
We're too late. It's 2:30.
We need to buy some time.
Where's Rita's phone?
I'll text Dr. Blakely.
I know I have a reputation for being tough.
The students' nickname for me is Ms. Trouble, but I'm tough because I care about these young people.
A good education is their path to a bright future.
Like seeds, they need nutritious soil to germinate.
What's the final ingredient?
You girls look so serious.
This is serious, Rita.
If you don't get to the review, you could lose your job.
Oh.
Oh, all right.
Uh, to complete the potion you need to add three drops of...
Three drops of what?
Oh, dear.
 I can't seem to remember.
Stop kidding around, Rita.
But I'm not kidding.
I really can't remember.
Strawberry and chocolate for you.
Banana and licorice for me.
Banana and licorice?
Hey, don't knock it until you try it.
Uh, thanks, but I want to stay friends with my stomach.
Green algae.
Are you sure? It's very green already.
They're not going to wait much longer. We better move it.
Rita, the final ingredient? Think.
Don't yell at me.
 Now what was it?
Oh, it's no use.
Call Zac.
Okay.
I knew it couldn't last.
Hey, Weilan.
What?
Now?
: During her time as Principal of Suncoast High, Principal Santos has done a wonderful job running the school.
But I believe it's time for change.
 Dad?
Zac? What are you doing?
Uh, I need to speak to you.
I'm in the middle of an interview.
It's really important.
Please.
This better be important.
I was looking through the booklets you gave me.
Yes?
Very informative, weren't they, Evie?
Very.
In fact, there are a couple of courses I'm interested in.
That's very nice. Now, why did you get me out here?
After reading the guides and talking to Evie, we discussed it a lot, didn't we?
We canvassed a lot of possibilities, Dr. Blakely.
Looked at all the options--
Would you please get on with it?
I want to be a doctor, like you.
That's very flattering, Zac, but you could have waited to tell me till I got home.
You said I should make a decision, and I wanted to let you know.
We'll discuss this later.
Dad?
Now what?
Rita, I don't mean to hassle you, but--
Seaweed extract!
Oh, that's what it is.
 Mmm.
Is it the tufted seaweed or the broadleaf seaweed?
Oh, I can't remember.
How do we decide?
Well, Rita said it's one of them, so we have an even chance of getting it right.
Or getting it wrong.
I say pick one and go for it.
 For goodness sake.
: As I see it, the principal of a school is like the captain of a ship... steering her staff and students across a vast ocean... through the peaks and troughs of the academic year.
We'll give you a moment, Ms. Trumble.
That won't be necessary, Dr. Blakely.
With my strong hand at the helm, I am confident that I can steer the proud ship, named Suncoast High, safely to harbor.
Thank you, Ms. Trumble, for a most interesting presentation.
You'll have our decision by Monday.
: Rita?
It's ready.
If this works, there's still a chance for you to make the interview.
Dr. Blakely!
Principal Santos? What happened?
I'm so very sorry. I had... an unexpected holdup.
: The board members are still here.
I'm sure they'd be happy to conduct your review.
Come on, we'd better hurry.
Principal Santos?
What's wrong?
You know the hardest thing about being old?
It's looking back and seeing how far away some things are.
I'm going to miss Suncoast High.
 Maybe Ms. Trumble won't be as bad as we think.
Are you kidding?
She'll be worse.
How could Rita quit on us?
I don't think you should see it like that.
And I think I know why.
Enlighten us, please.
There's nothing harder than being caught between two worlds.
Eventually... one of them has to win.
You really giving it up?
Today, when I was looking out at the ocean, I felt something I haven't felt in a long time.
I love teaching, but... I miss the sea.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
But right now...
I need a swim.
Ondina?
You wanted to speak to me?
Not exactly.
Veridia?
Rita.
I have a problem.
Ondina feels that she has taken her students as far as she can.
She feels that what they require now is a teacher who can truly inspire them.
You wouldn't happen to know someone like that, would you?
Someone who can unlock our young mermaids' potential.
I might know someone.
That was a great thing you did, giving your job to Rita.
No big deal. Rita was born to teach.
I bet you won't be missing those little mermaids.
Actually, I will.
It's simple.
The ball must be formed perfectly in your mind... and then it will be perfect in reality.
We've done this before.
It's so old.
That's true, Amaris... but what you might not realize is that with just a simple twist what was old can become something... magical.
: Wow!
Whoa!
Amazing!
