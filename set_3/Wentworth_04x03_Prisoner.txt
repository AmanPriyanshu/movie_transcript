Her lawyer has gone straight to the board.
She's demanding to be released into general population.
You wanna start something, anything, you run it by me first.
Okay?
Got it, Bea.
Check with the boss.
Allie's got the hots for you.
You should use it to your advantage, Bea.
I reckon you'd look better lighter.
You reckon?
I could do it for you. Give you a cut and colour.
It is possible that Ferguson will be released into the general population.
I need an undertaking she won't be harmed.
What the women want is the conjugal visits.
(dummy drops from above)
: Jesus!
: Release Ferguson into general.
Give her what she wants.
I want Ferguson to face justice. She dies on my watch, she wins.
I'm wondering what her motivation is.
I mean, if Bea doesn't kill her, someone else will.

Enjoy your accommodation, bitch!
: An officer will be stationed outside the unit at all times.
That must be quite a strain on the overtime budget.
It's either that or cover the medical costs when the women tear you apart.
Fill in the visitors form if you'd like to see anyone.
The next count is after lunch. Dinner is at...
Six. Last count at 07:30. You can spare me the induction speech.
Why are you doing this?
Putting your life in danger.
I have every confidence in your ability to keep me safe.
Last thing a new governor needs is a major incident.
Your dining room privileges are suspended for the time being.
Meals will be delivered.
(muffled chatter outside in unit)
Thank you.
Nice to see you wearing the pants.
(cell door slides and latches closed)
: So, you were out there, (scoffs) you saw them.
Next time it won't be a dummy hanging from the stairs.
That will be all, Miss Miles.
(door closes)
If anything happens to her, everyone will pay the price.
This entire prison will be in lockdown for months.
Most of them think it's worth it.
We had a deal.
I got you the conjugal visits and that was no mean feat, now it is your turn.
Make it clear that Ferguson is off limits.
I have done!
It is in our common interest to contain this situation until her trial.
Then I can try and have her moved interstate.
Why do you think she wants to be in general?
Just make sure she doesn't get touched.
She's here until the trial.
Isn't that months away?
Oi, Bea... when are we gonna get The Freak?
No one touches her until I say so.
You spread the word.
(incredulously) I've just been kicked out of H3 for that bitch!
If anything happens to her and the Governor goes, we lose all our new programs.
Like I give a sh1t!
Yeah, 'cause I see you and your boys enjoying the film nights... you wanna lose that?
Now, piss off!
Hey... have you got a plan?
Yeah. To keep her alive so we can see her suffer.
When did you first notice the lump?
Was... day before yesterday.
You can feel it?
Mmm.
It's probably just a cyst, right?
Have you had any pain in the breast or under your arm?
No.
Any loss of appetite?
Nope (chuckles).
I'll send you to the hospital for a mammogram.
I'll try and arrange that for this afternoon.
Do you think it's serious?
Look, it could easily be a fibroid, but let's make sure.
You can get dressed now, love, if you like.
(sighs)
: I've changed the rosters...
I want you to keep your distance from Ferguson.
Given your history, there's a distinct possibility this is about getting to you.
The only reason I want her kept alive, is so she can face trial.
You and me both.
Then, they can do whatever they like.
Conjugal visits start tomorrow, so the women will be distracted.
That should take some of the pressure off.
Well, let's hope so. Um... where've you put Ferguson?
H3, with Proctor.
: This is a f*ckin' joke.
What about our privacy? We have rights.
Why is she in here with us anyway?
'Cause we haven't got a history.
Have you heard the stories?
Yeah... could be bullshit... who knows?
You gonna stand there all day?
Couldn't think of anywhere I'd rather be.
Then what... go home for a little wank?
Not with you in mind, that's for sure.
Ha!
: Officer?
I'd like to make some tea.
Proctor will do it.
(chuckles) I'm not your f*ckin' slave.
: I'll get it myself.
No, you're confined to your cell today.
Just do it, Proctor, then get to your work duty.

I need you to concentrate now, Joan.

Thank you. I would have done it myself, but... he didn't give me much choice.

It's Kaz, isn't it?
Yeah.
I'm Joan.
Hey, Joan.

I admire you.
I admire what you do.
Standing up for women and... fighting for the underdog.
If you ever need my support, you... well, you know where I am (scoffs).
I'm sure you've heard Bea Smith's version of the story... but, just so you know... things are not always as they seem.
(echoed flourish)
Let's get her showered.
Jenkins.
Yeah?
Anderson.
Yeah?
Sorry, your, ah, application for conjugals has been rejected.
What? Why?
You'd have to take it up with the Governor.
: Oh, I've been approved!
With who?
Daz.
But you're not even with Daz, love.
Yeah, I am.
He... he just doesn't know about it yet.
Why would they reject me?
'Cause you gotta sign up for that pill program thingy.
Well, I did. I've been on the pill for a week already.
Yeah, that's sounds like a mistake, Dor, just check it out with the Governor.
: Look, Bea, have you seen this? Look.
: What the hell?
: What does it say?
You right?
: 
Mmm.
: 
Doctor's sending me for a mammogram.
Oh, love. Oh, you'll be right.
Yeah, I know. She just wants to be sure.
Mmm. When is it?
This afternoon.
Mm-hmm. You gonna tell the girls?
Oh, no, I don't wanna worry them.
Besides, Bea's got enough on her plate.
She has indeed.
: 
: 
Hey, Dor, did you talk to Miss Bennett?
Nuh. Officers reckon she's too busy.
Oh, love, she can't stop you seein' Nash, that horse has already bolted.
Hey, if you're not hungry, Max, I'll have it.
'Cause I've gotta keep my energy up for all the rootin', eh?
Booms, to get pregnant, you have to have proper nutrition, right?
You can't just keep having all this fat and sugar.
That's bullshit!
No it's not.
No, my aunty, right, she ate whatever she wanted... she didn't even know she was preggers until she dropped one out.
Have you even asked Daz yet?
Yes, I have! Course I have. Right?
One reminder of these puppies and he was like arrrrrgh.
Oh what, he was suffocating, was he?
(Boomer chuckles)
Funny.
Hey, Bea, what you got planned for The Freak?
I dunno, Boomer, (whispers) but I'm planning on taking a dump.
: Ooh, charming.
Oh, Bea, stop staring. I get it, you like me.
Hair looks good.
Oh, thanks. I got a good hairdresser.
So, I hear The Freak's in your unit...
Uh, yeah.
(scoffs) Lucky you!
So, what's she doing?
Just sitting there.
She say anything?
Not much. Just stares at the wall.
Like she's out of it.
Meditating or something.
(echoed memory) 
Joan, listen to me.
I need you to concentrate.
No, Joan, look at me.
Everything's going to be okay.
Now you're in a psychiatric facility.
No, no, it's okay. No one's going to harm you.
You're safe now.

(background chatter)
Kaz?
Please, ah, sit down.
No, I'm good.
Look, I-I do apologise for the inconvenience of... always having that man there.
I tried to argue against it, but the Governor believes that I'm at risk from the other prisoners.
Not from us.
Thank you.
Well, then I...
I have a proposal... if you'd be willing to guarantee my safety...
Guarantee your safety?
You obviously have influence. If I can assure Miss Bennett that...
I'm fine in here, with you, then there'll be no need for that, and she can get rid of him.
Well, isn't it your mandate to protect vulnerable women?
It is... but you're a screw, and worse than that you were the governor.
Paper covers rock.
I will not put my girls in danger to protect you.
(indistinct background chatter)
The readjustment process for the women will take some time.
The new programs are a great initiative, but just bear in mind, most of them are institutionalised, so they're gonna have to become accustomed to the new order.
Ferguson being amongst them is a reminder of the old days.
But that is why I'm keeping her under guard.
Mmm. Have you any idea, as to her agenda, now that she's in general?
It may be to get revenge on Smith or Will Jackson but...
I suspect we won't know what she's up to until it happens.
Well, I still don't understand how her doctor at the psych hospital could possibly have deemed her sane.
(echoed memory) 
I'd like that.
Good.
(indictinct P.A. announcement)
Officer?
I'd like to meet with the peer worker.
(laughter)
Smith, is that laundry for the conjugal?
Yeah.
I'll take over from here, thanks.
Go.
What are the women saying about Ferguson?
What do you think? They wanna kill her.
Officers reckon I should've let her burn.
Yeah, well...
Any clues as to why she wants to be in general?
I have no idea. Vera won't let me anywhere near her.
So, watch your back.
Well, it's just one of her against a whole lot of women who hate her...
Yeah, still, don't underestimate what she's capable of.
Well, you better watch your back too then, huh?
It's only a couple of months until her trial.
Until then, we just have to manage her.
: ...the sheets. Nah, she wasn't there...
: 
If they're not already rooting they sure as hell want to.
: Hey...
What's, ah, what's with you and Jackson?
(scoffs) Nothing.
You porkin' him?
(chuckles) What?
But you like him?
That's none of your business.
There must be a mistake... a whole bunch of other women are getting conjugals.
I should've been approved.
It's not a mistake.
I can't take any risks with this program.
It was hard enough convincing the board.
Why am I at risk?
Do I really need to spell it out?
You had s*x with a man, in the prison grounds, and got pregnant.
You are a poster girl for the board's concerns.
I won't get pregnant again, I'm on the contraceptive program, and I'm peer worker. Surely I'm entitled to some privileges.
I'm sorry, it's not happening.
But, regarding your peer worker status...
Joan Ferguson has requested a visit.
Ferguson?
There's no pressure.
I am just obliged to pass on the message.
You can say no, if you want to.
I'm not doin' it. She's nuts!
Ugh, she might try and pash you again, eh? (chuckles)
You know, stick the tongue in.
Oh, come one.
Oh, it's your nightmare come true.
Ah, shut up, Boomer.
Well, it's more action than you're gettin' from Nash.
Booms... stop it.
Conway, you're due in medical.
Are you sick?
Funny tummy.
Oh.
You'll be right, love.
Doreen, come here.
I need you to go and see Ferguson.
You go see her. I don't feel safe with her.
Well, there's a guard outside her door, she's not gonna try anything.
She'll talk to you... and we can find out if she's up to anything.
I'm not doin' it.
Doreen!
I'm not asking.
Doreen... come on in, please, sit down.
I'm here as peer worker... what do you want?
I'd like a shower... and an airing.
Seems fair enough.
We'll ask the Governor.
How's little Joshua?
He's good.
I wouldn't mind saying hello sometime.
He's with his dad now, on the outside.
That... that's a wise decision.
Has anybody told you what really happened in the fire?
(tense music begins)
When I found little Joshua, Warner had him.
He was screaming.
She was trying to smother him.
She was deranged, Doreen.
I had to wrench him from her arms, but before we could get away, she-she started a fire.
The gate shorted and we were trapped. That's when Bea Smith found us.
What happened to Jess?
We lost her in the flames.
I couldn't save Warner, but I did save your son.
Thank you.
He was just a little baby, Doreen, anybody would have done the same.
(whispered) I miss him.
Course you do.
But the fact that you could let him go... that just demonstrates what a fine mother you are.
(steam press sound)
Is that all she said?
And she asked for an airing and a shower.
She must be on new medication or something, 'cause she seemed, I dunno... different.
Different? Well, don't get sucked in, Doreen. It's all an act.
So, what are you gonna do?
Nothing.
Well, the women are gettin' agro.
Yeah.
Juice is revving 'em up.
Oh, that bloody loud mouthed cow.
You put the word out again.
Anyone touches her, they're f*cked!
Righto.
You told me that your childhood was full of tension and anxiety and expectation.
You also said you used to find sanctuary in the music your father played.
I want you to remember that... it's all right.
(door closes and music stops abruptly)
: Mr. Lawson tells me you didn't eat lunch. it was brought in fresh, the inmates didn't prepare it.
Wasn't hungry.
Anderson passed on your requests.
I can organise a shower for you later, but I can't give you an airing.
Why not?
Because you'll be lynched.
Maybe it's what I deserve.
(phone rings in background)
Maybe they need to get it out of their system.
Do you have a death wish?
I'll have to integrate with the women sooner or later.
You can outside tonight, after lockdown.
I'd like to sit in the sunshine.
It's been months.
Sorry.
I don't want to make trouble for you, Vera, but if I have to take this up with the Ombudsman, I will.

Someone had a go at Ferguson.
Yeah, except f*ckin' Doreen stopped 'em. Ya f*ckin' idiot. (chuckles)

Nah, everyone is goin' bluko, they wanna do somethin'.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, you better bloody well do somethin'.

Do I have to spell it out for you, Boomer?
What?
Do you want to lose your conjugals?
I'll be speaking to the board about having you transferred immediately.
You're going back to protection.
No.
It is impossible to keep you safe here and you are putting my staff in danger.
You're implying this is somehow my fault?
Of course it's your fault.
It's your job to keep the women in line.
You don't get to lecture me about my job.
You wanna be seen as the "good Governor".
The "fair Governor" but really you just wanna be liked.
It's fatal, Vera. Surely I taught you that?
I learnt nothing from you.

Mm, even in relationships?
I've never had a, um... a conventional relationship.
