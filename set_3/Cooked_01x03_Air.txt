: We add a little bit of salt.
Then we mix it together.
Add some sugar, Mom.
: No, you can't do that.
Oh, son, I'm tired already.
Tell the baker to put the bread in the oven as soon as you get there.
Now?
Yes.
Take your time.
Be careful.
: 
I don't know if there's another food I like quite as much as bread, I have to say.
Oh, it's such a simple food. It's, like, three ingredients.
Flour, water, a little salt.
Why do we like air in our food?
It's lighter, obviously, but also, all those air pockets have gas in them.
And so, there is flavors that come up through the back of your mouth into your sinus cavities, and they're tasted there.
And that's why crackers aren't as good as bread, and why flour isn't as good as bread.
 
 
 I was probably most intimidated by, uh, by baking bread.
: 
: 
I have lived on this farm since I was a boy.
I inherited the land from my father.
 Before we begin, we have to divert the river to add more pressure.
: It's working. Carry on what you were doing.
Yes.
: 
 It's okay like that.
 
He was all the time busy with the grain, with the flour.
: Everybody, come eat before you leave.
: Sarah. Abdellah. Come.
: 
: 
: 
: 
There was a bowl of pulverized grain with water, of porridge, and it was off in a corner and neglected for a couple days, and some yeast from the air got into it, 
Let's put this in the oven and see what happens."
And it got even bigger.
And there was the first loaf of bread...
But it takes a whole new division of labor to make it work.
: 
: 
People would say, "Oh, this girl, she married a baker! This is good, because she will have enough bread. It is an honorable profession."
: 
 and that this one grass called wheat was the way to make it, uh, wheat then takes off, and it becomes the most important grass we plant.
: 
 we can work with international and with other countries' grains.
For example, last year we didn't have Ukrainian wheat because of the political situation there.
: 
 because they all know, every political leader knows, you can lose your head if the price of bread goes up too fast.
: 
 following yet another outburst of food rioting.
: 
: 
: 
If you can't afford meat and you can't afford vegetables, you can usually still afford bread.
Now it will essentially rest for 45 minutes.
If you look at the size of it, in the bowl, it's, you know, only coming up about a third.
And as the day goes on, it's gonna rise.
Bread-making is a kind of ingenious technology for the conversion of grass seeds into a really nutritious and delicious food.
You know, in a way, it's one of the first food processing technologies.
This is our master baguette, I think it has some really nice...
These were just baked a couple of hours ago, but...
: 
 but a loaf of bread and a pile of wheat 
: 
: Bread like this is largely air.
Now, if you got rid of all of the air, it'd be a lot smaller.
And I hate to do this to beautiful bread, but... this shows you how little is actually there.
Now, in a big rustic loaf like this... it's a little harder to squish it... but it's still mostly air.
And if you look inside, you can see that there's bubbles everywhere.
Air is mostly what you're eating when you eat bread.
The best material anybody has found in the context of bread is something called "gluten."
: 
And when they do, they form a substance that's very stretchy, extensible, but it also will return like a balloon.
Biologically, there's this very interesting phenomenon of retronasal olfaction.
The fact that we smell in two ways.
I mean, we smell things outside through our nose, and then we smell things in the back of our throat.
And it's all due to gluten.
: 
Lots of people have written books demonizing gluten, and saying, "Oh, my God, gluten is responsible for almost every bad thing you can imagine. It's cancer, it's insanity, it's all..."
Doesn't matter what it is, someone has claimed gluten causes it.
Ice cream shops in Greenwich Village all have signs saying, "gluten-free ice cream."
Well, there was never any gluten in ice cream!
: 
So, this is a regular, uh, gluten-free brioche next to our actual brioche loaf.
Both of these are based on our master recipe.
: So, this is the real deal.
So, the gluten-free brioche, it's not as stretchy.
Mmm-hmm.
: It's got a texture that's a little bit more like a pound cake.
By the same token, if someone says, "Oh, you shouldn't eat gluten. It's terrible for you," I would say, "Well, prove it."
And unfortunately, there's not been a whole lot of proof in that respect.
: 
Some of them have celiac disease, which is, like, a real allergy to gluten.
That's one or two percent of the population.
And then a much larger group, uh, report gluten intolerance.
 you know, we have a history of demonizing one nutrient and celebrating another nutrient.
An example of another nutrient that we demonized really badly, beginning in the '60s and '70s, is fat.
Dietary fat was the great evil nutrient.
: 
: 
 there's very little evidence to correlate fat intake with heart disease, uh, as it turns out.
Now, the focus has switched to carbohydrates.
It may be the changes in the way we make bread that are contributing to this problem.
'Cause the bread you buy in the supermarket, in that package, that Wonder Bread, um... is very different than what bread was for most of history.
You know, there used to be an official definition of bread.
The FDA had these standards of identity for all products.
And bread was, uh, you know, flour, water, salt.
And so, once you industrialize bread, and make things like Wonder Bread, the industry petitioned the FDA to loosen things up so they could move to this commercial thing.
This bread is three ingredients, basically, and commercial bread is 31 or 37 ingredients.
And so they redefined bread to admit these other 30 ingredients.
Um, so, is it the real thing?
The FDA says it's the real thing, but historically, no, it's not. It's a real novelty.
: 
: 
 really white flour, on a roller mill, this was a major change, and it looked like a great boon to civilization and to economics.
And suddenly you could make really white flour that everybody could afford. It seemed like a great thing.
: 
: 
 because we had removed the most nutritious part of the flour without even realizing it.
 you go back and you pick up the thread.
And we didn't do that with white flour.
: 
: 
And they sold this as something better and brand new.
: 
And this is really how capitalism usually works, right?
It creates a problem, and rather than fix the problem, it creates a new business to solve the problem.
 we overlook the reason why it was done in this somewhat more painstaking way.
And in the case of bread, what we may have overlooked is the importance of a long, slow sourdough fermentation.
Sourdough is the proper way to make bread.
You can feel the difference from an hour or so ago, which is that it feels billowy.
I started this bread last night, and then it takes about four hours of bulk fermentation.
And I taste it... at every stage to really find out how my fermentation is going.
And it should get more sour as the day goes on, but if it gets too sour, you know, you've over-fermented, so you have to keep an eye on that.
: 
I used to make a little dessert on Sunday morning.
That was my specialty. I would make that for the family.
I'll load these, uh...
Yeah.
...peasant French in about five minutes, okay?
: All right.
All right, that's it on that one?
Yep.
Okay.
Where are we at? Seeded rye here?
I prefer when they go in one at a time. I'll show you why.
They come out nicer if you hold them back just a little bit.
I process grain. I process them in a way that they become digestible.
That's really my goal.
And it's locked up real tight, like, uh...
I like to use the example of a Batmobile, you know.
And it's all--
Uh, you've seen the movie, I'm sure, where it's all, you know, you hit the clicker and the thing locks up.
: 
 that transform the wheat into a very nutritious substance.
: 
If you don't do this, you don't get the nutrients out of it.
: 
 that represents one of those simplifications of industrial food that had unintended consequences that we're dealing with right now.
I think we're gonna turn the heat on on these ciabattas.
 you have no fermentation here, you have no acidic breakdown.
 eating more whole grain, so everybody gets on the bandwagon eating, like, whole-wheat macaroni, and, uh...
But they didn't say fermented whole grain.
: 
 if you took a dozen people who claimed a gluten intolerance and you gave them Richard's bread, they'd be fine.
: 
: 
It's like walking on crispy snow or something. It's just crispy.
It's just, uh-- And the smell. If you crack it a little bit, the aroma comes out, so... 
It's one of the little pleasures, you know, that a baker might get.
You know, it felt light enough. Just not too light, not too heavy.
Now if we look inside, everything is, um, opened nicely.
It formed the crust. It cooks from inside out.
And if you take the inside of the bread, just like this, this is where you can taste, really, if it's well done, if it tastes sweet as you chew it.
And the more you chew, the deeper it becomes.
The deeper the flavor comes.
It's like a whole--
It keeps changing. It keeps becoming more.
 something to wash it down.
You know, it kind of, like... It doesn't make you salivate.
 after the whole process of fermentation, it doesn't smell like wheat anymore.
It doesn't smell like, uh... It smells like something new.
: 
We have a monopoly on this technology.
But Richard convinced me that there is... There are exceptions.
: 
: 
: 
: 
And there will be places that were bread baskets that won't be any longer.
I think, even this one... I don't think that it's a good one.
But this one can be... This one is not bad.
Can be given a chance.
Some of them were dried because of the heat wave.
So, this has already lost most of its leaves.
It is the major crop.
It's contributing 60% of the calories in the diet.
: 
 and if that moves too much or too fast, we will see enormous political instability.
: 
: 
It's a home for seeds from all around the world.
: 
: 
: 
We are looking for very clean leaves like this.
That's what the breeders are looking for, to breed new varieties.
: 
: 
It could happen that a shell could destroy it completely.
Like this one, for example, has tolerance to drought, tolerance to heat, that the breeders can use today, or can use in the future, to overcome the challenges of heat and drought.
: 
You work the genes, you isolate them by crossing and selecting, crossing and selecting, until you get them into something useful for us.
: 
 most of the challenges to agriculture, most of the challenges posed to wheat around the world.
: 
And the challenge of bread-making is to access all those nutrients...
You feel like, "God, I really know what I'm doing."
And other times, it's kind of flat, and you don't exactly know what went wrong.
This is called an ear.
That's a good thing, to have a pronounced ear on a loaf of bread.
 Mmm.
I would do it just for the smell.
 and an enormous sense of, uh, satisfaction.
I think of all the things I learned how to make... uh, making a decent loaf of bread has been the most satisfying.
 Here, eat it.
