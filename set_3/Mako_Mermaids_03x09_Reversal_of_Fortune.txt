I never thought it would feel so strange... the water between my toes.
Evie, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean for this to happen.
I was trying to protect you.
I don't blame you.
We both lied to each other.
: 
 since she turned up with her tail-snatching friend.
We don't know the dragon followed her, and despite what happened, she was trying to help.
She lied to the mermaid council, Evie lost her tail, and the dragon is still out there waiting for the next full moon.
Ondina--
You know I'm right.
And if she does hang around till the next full moon, what then?
She comes up with another brainless plan and we all lose our tails?
Ondina, she's--
No, Mimmi. It has to be said.
The best thing would be for Weilan to move on.
You could have said something.
Just act normal, like nothing happened.
Got it.
: Hey, Evie! It's good to see you back.
I haven't been anywhere.
No. She just means... It's good to see you any, anytime.
: Yeah. Oh, hey, Evie.
You know, I'm more than happy to look after the shop for you after school... if you're still feeling a bit... you know.
A bit what?
We just know how much you loved being a mermaid.
And, I mean, if it was me I'd--
: Yes.
Losing my tail was a big deal.
But it's done and there's nothing anyone can do about it, so can we just drop it? Please.
Hey, on the bright side, now you can take a shower standing up.
I hope the fish are not also taking the day off.
Uncle Shen, remember? From market.
Hi.
No school today?
Free period.
Oh.
How'd the puzzle box work out for you?
Did you solve it?
Still a work in progress.
Some problems not so easy to solve.
Some take time.
Why do I not see you at my shop lately?
New stock arrive.
I give discount to regular customer.
Yeah, well...
I've been kind of busy messing things up for everybody.
Maybe you'll have better luck with the fish.
I'll see you around.
Oh, my... my eyesight not so good anymore.
Can you help me tie the hook?
: Are you gonna sit here all day?
You can't sulk forever.
Evie must be feeling terrible.
We should cheer her up.
How?
We should make her some Arctic Marshmallow. She loves that.
She doesn't need dessert.
Well, what do you suggest? We can't get her tail back.
Maybe we can.
 Impossible.
According to Weilan, when a mermaid loses her tail to a water dragon, it's gone forever.
But Evie's only a half-mermaid.
Remember the power of 50 moons spell we tried on Zac?
That's how Evie got her powers in the first place.
There's no guarantee that would work again.
Even if there's a chance, we should try. For Evie's sake.
We should ask her first. When she gets home from school this afternoon.
No. We should do it now.
We'll do a remote spell.
Is that a good idea?
Remote spells are hard to pull off.
The longer we wait, the less chance we have.
Imagine if you lost your tail.
Wouldn't you do anything to get it back?
: Are you sure this is a good idea?
We're giving Evie her tail back. I'm not seeing a problem.
What if she suddenly gets a tail in public?
She's at school. She won't be anywhere near water!
Let's go already.
How will we know when it's worked?
The potion will vanish.
Here we go.
: 
 occurs when molecules, in this case water, pass from a higher concentration to a lower concentration across a partially permeable membrane.
Now, if you will turn to page--
: Oh!
Everything all right there, Evie?
Sorry, Ms. Trumble.
Turn to page 147... and look at the tables comparing hypertonic...
Are you okay?
...isotonic and hypotonic solutions.
Does it look like I'm okay?
: Is it working?
I don't think so.
Keep trying.
Is this really the place for aerobics, Evie?
Sorry.
Take your seat.
: It's starting to break up.
You're losing it!
I've tried. It's not working.
Maybe it just needs a boost.
Ondina, no!
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
A bit tingly.
Look! The potion's vanished.
It must have worked.
 I guess.
 I knew we could do it.
You like it?
Rare blend, only grown in the highlands of Fujian.
It's lovely.
Where did you get it?
Local supermarket.
Something on your mind?
A problem shared... is a problem halved.
I tried to fix something.
A friend got hurt.
If you were trying to help, I'm sure your friend will forgive you.
 Not for this.
Her life will never be the same.
Never is a long time--
No.
You don't understand.
I'd do anything to put things back the way they were.
But I can't.
I want to tell her that I'm so sorry... but I can't do that either.
The best thing is for me to just disappear.
You mean run away.
The school's on the other side of the park.
We'll wait till they have a break and then talk to Evie then.
What are you doing?
Something's wrong.
What?
I can't get legs.
Are you sure?
I've been cooking myself for the last five minutes.
I'm boiled dry.
What did you do to me?
Me?
I never told you to use your moon ring.
You should have stopped me.
Do something.
Calm down. We'll sort this out.
What about Evie?
You swim back to the grotto.
I'll go get Evie and meet you there.
A long time ago, in China... my family lend me money to start shop.
I was not very smart.
Shop failed.
I was so ashamed I run away.
You look like you've done well.
Well, I'm much smarter now. 
But I still regret running away.
I'm not running away.
It's more like a... strategic withdrawal.
You cannot run from problem, Weilan.
It follows you, like shadow.
You must turn and face it.
Be brave. Be strong, like water.
Water's not strong.
Water is the most powerful force on Earth.
A river can wear away a rock.
The waves can change the shape of continents.
And yet water has grace and beauty, too.
Like you.
You've been in the sun too long, Uncle Shen.
Oh, perhaps you are right.
You help me carry back to my shop. Okay?
What just happened back there?
I have no idea.
Evie, how do you feel?
Why do you want to know?
Ondina and I tried a long-distance spell on you to try and get your tail back.
Well, that explains the crazy dance moves in class.
You didn't think to ask me first?
There was no time.
Come on, let's see if it worked.
: I'm so sorry, Evie.
I didn't mean to embarrass you in class.
If this works, all is forgiven.
Ready?
Okay.
: Thank you for trying.
Yeah.
Well, about that... there was a slight complication.
: Ow!
: Oh.
: Be careful!
: God. You're really heavy.
: Watch it!
: Ow. Ow, ow, ow!
Don't worry, Ondina. We are going to fix this.
Like we fixed Evie?
: And whose idea was that?
Call Rita. She'll have an answer.
What about Weilan?
What about her?
Well, she might be able to help.
Are you crazy?
I don't want to lose my tail permanently! 
Rita's not answering. Maybe she's in a meeting.
Well, don't just stand there! Go and look for her!
Sorry.
Go on. You can say it.
 What?
I messed up, didn't I?
We all make mistakes.
You don't have to sugar-coat it, Mimmi. I get it.
It's my own fault.
Well... now I guess you know how Weilan feels.
Oh, careful! Careful.
Oh.
What is it?
Oh.
Very beautiful painting of ancient myth.
The Legend of Jiaolong.
Ferocious dragon.
See. People run from dragon.
Like you.
What do you mean?
 You have dragon in your mind.
It is that what you fear, inside.
Even if you run away from this place... trouble will follow.
Are you sure you want to leave?
I don't know.
If you do decide to go, make sure it is for right reason.
Leave under a blue sky, not a cloud.
Here, I wanna give you this.
What is it?
Prawn crackers.
No one should make up mind on empty stomach.
Thank you.
Nice tail.
I'm just giving it a stretch.
The sandstone feels good on my scales.
What are you doing?
You got your wish. I'm leaving.
With any luck, the dragon will follow me and your pod will be out of danger.
Whoa!
Are you stuck like that?
Only because I was trying to fix your mistake and get Evie her tail back.
I told you, it's irreversible.
That's why your spell backfired.
I can probably fix what happened.
Like you fixed the dragon?
Weilan?
Weilan, stop!
Okay.
I admit that you did what you did to try and help.
That's not what you said this morning.
Maybe I've been a bit harsh on you.
But more than anything, I just wanna protect the pod.
So do I.
I never meant for Evie to get hurt.
I wish I could make things right.
Not just getting her tail back.
The dragon, too.
Well, you're not gonna be much help if you leave.
If we're gonna to defeat the dragon... we need to work together.
All of us.
Then we better start by fixing you.
The Golden Palm Technique should do it.
Wait.
Will it hurt?
Not at all.
But there's a chance you'll turn into a crab.
What?
Kidding.
Now show me your palm, like this.
And don't move.
Did it work?
You tell me.
Let's hope we're not too late.
What were you thinking?
What happened?
Weilan decided to show off some of her eastern spell-breaking magic.
Her cup of tea isn't bad either.
Well, I'm just glad everything's back to normal.
Weilan.
I'm sorry for missing school today, Rita.
I just had some personal stuff I needed to sort through.
Then I'll expect to see you at school tomorrow?
Wouldn't miss it.
Good. Oh!
Double homework, due first thing.
Evie... I'm so sorry.
You know, it's strange.
I feel like a weight has lifted off my shoulders.
This belongs to the pod.
Don't get me wrong.
Being a mermaid was a dream come true and I'll miss having a tail.
And we will miss having you swim with us.
Who says I can't swim with you?
I'm a pretty good diver, you know.
The best.
Is that so?
And she's always been fast in the water.
Bet you can't beat us to Mako.
Mmm.
Two words... speed boat.
Chosen your dive buddy yet?
What's this?
You got nothing else planned for tonight?
Well, I did have a few offers... but none quite as good as a night dive with the old man.
Permission to come aboard?
Yeah. Permission granted!
Hey.
Weilan.
What are you doing here?
You don't mind if I bunk with you, do you?
: Not at all. You're always welcome.
: You don't snore, do you?
Only when I sleep.
Ha-ha!
Good night, Weilan. Good night, Ondina.
Good night, Mimmi.
Good night, Weilan.
Good night.
