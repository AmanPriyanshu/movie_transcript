You can do whatever you want, all on your own.
What's going on, what's wrong?
I'm in love with him.
: I just got nominated for an Oscar.
I saw what happened with Jeff.
He wasn't alone on the roof.
No!
He died saving my life. I'm sorry.
I want to go on the show.
Go get her, son.
You had your meeting with that charity?
I could put a concert together with a bunch of friends.
I'm emancipating from you.
She signed with a label in New York.
: Yes, we should totally do lunch.
I need to steal Juliette away for a second.
Good luck tomorrow. Rooting for you.
See you at noon.
Great. Thank you, guys. Thank you.
Why can't they just give out the damn award already?
Why do they have to have so many parties?
Well, it's almost over.
Good, because I'm tired of pretending to be friends with people I don't know.
: Hi, Juliette!
[Sighs] This would just be so much easier if Cadence were here.
You know, somebody that's actually a part of my life.
: Hope you win!
Why can't she be? I mean, you do have a jet.
You don't think that's too big an ask?
Only one way to find out.
She sold out, huh?
Yep. All 18,000 seats.
Your mom knows how to throw a fundraiser.
It's a pretty big crowd, huh?
Yeah.
They're gonna love you.
Yes, they are. You're gonna be awesome.
I hope so.
: Will you make sure that the office has the entire guest list for the after-party?
Hey, you ever played pedal steel?
Yes, I love pedal steel.
Hi.
She's a little nervous, but she's very excited.
Good. I want her to have something fun.
Mm.
It's been such a tough couple weeks.
I hate it, too, you know... Maddie not being here.
I know.
Not trying to make you feel...
I-I know. I'm not.
It's just weird being here in the same city and not able to get in touch with her.
: Maddie.
How's my newest artist doing?
Ms. Donovan!
[Chuckles]
Oh, I was just telling Cash about how amazing your label's been to me.
Well, I'm glad you're happy.
I think you're gonna be even happier.
I'd like to introduce you to the man who's going to produce your album.
Hey, Vince.
Oh, my God. That's Vince Pierce.
Maddie.
Hey.
Wow. Pleasure to meet you.
It's such an honor to meet you, Mr. Pierce.
I'm a huge, huge fan.
The honor is all mine.
I have not seen talent like yours in a very long time.
That means so much.
All right. You ready to get to it?
Yeah.
Um, would you mind if I told a few friends about this first?
All right.
[Chuckles]
[Camera clicks]
You look a hell of a lot better. How you feeling?
Mom's gonna come visit before I go back in, though.
Oh. Well, uh, let me know when that happens so I can avoid being there at the same time.
Rather not run into her and Gary.
Not like we talk much.
She okay?
I mean, he was never the one, you know?
[Knock on door]
: Hey, Luke.
Hey, you know what, son? I should go.
I got somebody in my office.
I'll call you back, okay?
I've been in media training for two weeks.
I got my talking points.
You want to tell me what we're discussing?
This.
He even tried to get onto my

You can't win a war if you don't face your enemy.
I got to get on her show, Luke, even if it means I got to force my way on.

[Door closes]
That was Bucky.
My album has sold 10,000 copies in two weeks, and it's on 
 200.
Oh, congratulations.
Really? That's it?
[Sighs] I'm sorry. That's incredible news. Really.
I'm just, uh, a little distracted.
Juliette called.
She really wants Cadence with her in L.A.
Offered to send her plane, put us up in a nice hotel.
What do you think?
Oh. Uh... I think it's weird.
I mean, I would love to take a trip with both of you, but... not to see your ex-wife.
Oh, she just wants to see her daughter on a very big night and she's trying to make it as easy as possible for everyone.
[Sighs] No. She is trying to control you, Avery.
I can't believe that you're giving in to all of her crazy demands.
They're not crazy. They're not even demands.
I know Juliette's done some bad things in the past, believe me, but, I mean, at least she's trying to take responsibility for them.
[Scoffs] What?
I don't know what to tell you.
Juliette is the mother of my daughter.
She's always gonna be in our lives.
And I'm taking Cadence to L.A. to support her, so I hope you'll join us.
Hi!
Welcome back.
Thank you.
How was your break?
It was good. Yours?
Good.
[Sighs]
So... you talk to Gunnar at all?
Uh, well, last I heard, he was road-tripping across the Southwest, so... no.
Well, you gonna tell him what you told me?
Yes.
I just don't know, um... when or how.
Well, I have faith in you.
And I'm sure it'll all work out, just like it did at the photo shoot.
Oh.
[Chuckles]
You don't think I'm being crazy, do you? To tell him?
I think you're being honest with yourself for the first time in a while.
I better go make sure that the VIPs are all set for the meet-and-greet tonight.
Thanks.
Hey!
Hey, brother!
[Laughs] What's up?
I'll be back.
You're back!
Yeah!
Good to see you, huh?
You too.
Oh. You know what?
I was hoping we could, uh, we could talk for a second.
Um... a lot's happened in the last couple weeks, and...
Wow.
[Chuckles]
That looks amazing.
Thanks.
The photographer worked real hard with me to get me to be honest about what I was feeling when I listen to our music.
Well, it... it worked. [Chuckles]
Yeah, it made me think about a lot.
Um...
I-I realized...
I'm in love with you, Gunnar.
[Footsteps approach]
Oh, good. You've talked.
Uh, we haven't, actually.
I really hope this isn't gonna make things weird at all around here.
Oh, you guys are...
Yeah.
Just back from two weeks in Aruba.
Yeah. I-I...
I didn't get a chance to, uh... to s...

How's Daphne doing?
You know, I mean, I really think she's trying to put on such a game face, and I don't think she's doing well at all.
What's going on with our 
 daughter?
Having fun in New York City.
Great.
Restaurants, clubs, heels that are too damn high.
Those are some expensive heels, too.
She's gonna blow through her advance in no time.
[Chuckles]
Wait a minute.
What?
Is that Vince Pierce?
Yeah, why?
Oh, my God.
This guy is the worst.
Why do you say that?
Because when I was Maddie's age, he practically tried to force himself on me.
Are you serious?
Yeah. I'm serious.
And now it appears he's working with our daughter.
Do we have to go to that dinner thing tonight?
I'm afraid so.
Can I wear my PJs?
Oh, come on, honey.
Juliette, were you with your manager when he fell to his death?
What?
Hey, step back. Security!
The story's already on our website.
I need security over here!
How did you...
No, no! Don't say a word to this clown.
Don't say anything.
Is it true?
Were you on that roof?
Come on.
Juliette, what really happened on that roof that night?
♪
Why tell me now? I mean w-what's changed?
You. You've changed.
You have this new confidence, and she can feel it. Trust me.

Girls like Scarlett love keeping guys like you on the line.
So you think she's manipulating me?
I'm just saying she's playing a head game, whether she means to or not.
Well, whatever she's doing, it could... it could ruin the band, which sucks, 'cause we have, what, like, 30 dates left on the tour.
You could accompany me solo.
Oh.
No pressure.
It's just an option that's out there for you.
We'd been working on something all day, and he wanted to go back to his place to... to write a song.
Next thing I know, he just starts leaning in and really just pushing himself on me.
And I said, "There must be some mistake.
This isn't what I'm here for."
And he said, "You don't like me?
You don't want to get ahead in this business?"
Oh, my God.
And I said, "Not like this, I don't."
And I started trying to get up, and he literally grabbed me and pulled me down on the couch, and I was scared.
All right.
I'm not quite sure how I got out of there.
But I did.
And I told my manager about it, and he said, "Well, that's what happens, hon.
And anyway, nothing really happened, right?
You're fine."
Great manager.
Yeah, I fired him.
Mm.
And I never worked with Vince again.
But, you know, he went off to New York, became a bigwig.
And now the son of a bitch is working with our daughter.
Not if I can help it.
Hey, Kevin. I appreciate you stopping by.
Know it's last-minute.
Yeah, happy to help.
Hey, man. [Chuckles]
I was intrigued by Will's message.
Have a seat.
Yeah, I hope you didn't mind.
It's just that you're pretty much the only link to the community I have.
Yeah, of course not. So, how can I help?
Well, I'm taking the fight to Cynthia Davis, and I'm doing it because it's not just 
 fight anymore.
Of course, it never was, but, uh...
Anyway, I want to pay her a visit, make it hard to ignore me.
Cynthia's show is broadcast out of Atlanta.
We were wondering if you knew any folks down there help us draw a crowd.
Yeah, I can definitely put in some calls.
Great.

 can go, bring some friends.

Well, okay.

How we gonna do this?
When the cops asked if I was there, I said "no,"
because at first, I didn't remember being there.
And then I started getting all these flashbacks.
[Voice breaking] It was supposed to be me.
I wanted to jump.
Honey. I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize that you were feeling so bad.
No. There's nothing you could've done.
I put all this on myself.
Everything that happened was because of me.
And now everybody knows it.
See, that's what I don't get.
How did they find out?
And why now?
I mean, I told Layla a few weeks ago.
I knew that there was a chance she could use it against me, but...
I didn't hear anything, so I just hoped...
Whatever.
If it 
 her, I can't blame her.
It's my fault Jeff's dead.
Honey, look, it was an accident, okay?
You didn't mean for anybody to get hurt.
As far as the public's concerned, this is just a tabloid rumor.
If we just ignore it, there's a good chance it'll all just blow over.

My pleasure.
I really need to get in contact with Maddie.
So you got on my schedule to get her phone number?
I'm very concerned about her working with Vince Pierce.
You know, I worked with him back in the day, and it was a bad experience.
I mean, you've heard all the rumors, and... and he was inappropriate with me, and I just... I don't want to take the risk that that might happen with Maddie.
Look, with all due respect, Vince is now one of the most sought-after producers in the world.
He's a legend.
Does he have an eye for the ladies? Sure.
But in my experience, he's been a total gentleman.
[Scoffs] Well, not in mine.
Look, there's not a woman in this industry that hasn't been hit on in one way or another.
And you're okay with that?
It comes with the territory.
And as women, we deal with it.
Well, Maddie's not a woman. She's a teenage girl.
And, Caitlyn, she's my daughter.
But she's 
 artist.
Are you gonna help me or not?

She wouldn't give you a phone number, either.

All this money... mine, the studio's, the label's... it's just perpetuating a lie.
I'm a horrible person.
And these people worship me because they don't know that.
And here I am, about to set foot on the world's biggest stage and lie some more to the press about how great I am.
Okay, first off, you don't have to talk to the press at all if you don't want to.
We can skip the red carpet line entirely.
Glenn, you're missing the point.
Well, then... tell me how I can help you.
You can't.
Hey. You ready?
I think so.
I 
 so.
Where's Deacon?
He's not here.
He said he had something important that he really needed to take care of, wanted me to tell you not to worry.
I talked to Colin. He's ready to step in and play lead.
Are we gonna do this without him?
We got each other's backs, right?
: ...incredible lineup we have for you tonight.
Please...
Let's go. help me welcome her back to the stage...
Rayna Jaymes!
[Cheers and applause]
Ms. Barnes? Right this way, please.
We're gonna skip the carpet today, thanks.
I'm sorry.
Can you help me find Deborah Roberts?
Mm-hmm.
[Sighs]
[Door closes]
Scarlett, listen...
No. 
 listen.
I think...
I tried to tell you something yesterday, and I didn't get the chance to finish.
I love you, and I would never tell you that to confuse you or control you in any way.
And I'm afraid of the feeling because you affect me more than anybody else ever has, and frankly, it scares the hell out of me.
So I hid it.
And I ain't hiding it no more.
Even if I believe you, h-how do I know you're not gonna change your mind tomorrow?
H-how do I know this isn't just
'cause w-we're breaking up the band?
I told you I love you 'cause I love you.
All right, if you don't feel the same, that's fine, but don't you tell me how to feel.
Hey, guys. Time to walk.
[Sighs]
[Dance music plays in distance]
There is an intimacy between creative people when they make an album.
Or there

If it's right, you know?
Yeah.
So, let's talk about it, you know?
Dig in.
Okay.
Tell you what... I'm gonna grab us some more drinks.

I have an amazing team that works very hard to protect me.
But I think some things just shouldn't be swept under the rug.
Are you referring to the recent rumors about the death of your manager?
Yes.
The fact is that I 
 up on that roof the night my manager died, and I was up there because I was trying to commit suicide.
Did you call the police?
No, I was so messed up on drugs and alcohol, I didn't remember it happened... not until later.
And that's when I disappeared from the public eye, and I went to rehab, and I've been trying to put my life back together ever since.
I appreciate that, but I'm not doing any of this for sympathy.
I don't deserve it.
I just wanted people to know the truth, and I want Jeff's family and friends to know that he was a hero

Hey. Come on.
Sweetheart, you were all about cozying up to me for a selfie yesterday.
Then you came to my party.
And now suddenly you're not interested?
Uh, I was never interested.
Mm.
Not like that.
Wow.
I, uh...
I must've misunderstood.
See, I-I thought you wanted to be a grown-up and have a real, grown-up career.
If this is what it takes to have a career, then I-I don't want one.

No, no, no, no, no!

No! I'm sorry! Listen to me!
I got caught up in everything, and I'm really sorry.
I promise that will never happen again.
You know me.
Come on!

It's your choice.
Let's get out of here.

They're grateful, son.

Look, uh, it's none of my business, but, um... you never know if you'll get a second chance unless you
