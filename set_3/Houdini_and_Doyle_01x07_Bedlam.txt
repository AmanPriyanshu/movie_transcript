Father, you need to help me.
What is your plight?
I feel darkness all around me that compells me to do things.
What sorts of things?
Shameful things, please to make me say.
But you must acknowledge you sin before you can be forgiven for them.
I'm so weak... I allow the darkness inside me and I'm so afraid.
You're a child of God. He will not let harm come to you.
I'm not afraid for me... I'm afraid for you.
I'm his flesh.
I'll do this deed of trust... between Wickbold EA and Arthur Conan Doyle With the offer to Purchase No. 46 Forbes Street, London, The home of Charles Doyle.
Hey, did you find out anything more about night ou panic instan.
This is not the place.
Have you requested coroner's report? Could be nothing!
Dr. Doyle, have you discovered anything?
The victm's facial distortion is the symptom of stress-provoked ventricular fibrillation. Which flooded her heart with adrenaline.
She was frightened to death.
You look worse than usual...
Children were particularly rambunctious last night.
Witnesses reported this woman exhibited the strength of several men.
A drowning can make people do extraordinary things.
Like the Michigan's stunt, for example.
The whole thing frozen over.
I dove in this hole but I can't find my way back.
I was drowning.
I'd punched out of 18 inches of ice.
The police claimed that she was possessed by some sort of demon.
The only thing that possessed her was a sick mind.
You don't believe in evil?
Human evil, yes.
Don't tell me you think there's an actual devil out there somewhere walking around with horns and pitchforks.
I believe in God, why shouldn't I believe in Lucifer?
Just because you believe in one fairy tale doesn't mean you believe in all...
It's an obsession.
It's insanity.
For being possessed may have looked insane.
Look at this.
It's some sort of skin sensitiveness urticaria, although I've never seen in such configuration.
She's wearing a nice ring.
The clothes... It seems... institutional B-R-H Bethlem Royal Hospital.
Only known as Bedlam.
It's the clothes they issue the patients who have been released.
So, she's just got out of the loony bin...
Then equals what? Loony?
Anyone behaving at all out of the ordinary can be commited jumping to a frozen lake, for instance.
What an atrocity is commited in this snake pit.
Bedlam or wakes.
Clearly Molly shouldn't never have been released. Especially with her weak heart and a history of delusions.
I never went to medical schools... but didn't they just say 'I'm right and you're wrong'?
A weak heart doesn't necessarily rule out possessions.
You've all tried for her realease?
No, no, that was Dr. Randall.
He harbour a hope for curing fear itself to abstract somatis...
But a..
He's had glimmer of promises.
A chase into some severe issues made that happened again.
Well, we only behave his words.
Worth to show.
I'd take a most substantive approach than Dr. Randall.
Electroshock, lobotomies have proved very effective.
Turning people in to house plants surely is.
As a doctor you understands the brain is an organ... like any other.
Like any other?
I'd hate to hear that kidneys are there for symphony.
Many patients here live in their own filthy.
Which patriot confess chill to view them like animals in the zoo?
I brought humanity to Bethlam.
Arthur Conan Doyle.
We meet at last.
My name is Hendridge.
Sherlock Holmes.
We currently have three patients with the same delusion.
In the matter of logic two of us must be wrong.
At least.
But you have a lot of fans in here.
I'm honored you like the character.
Actually...
I've noted 87 occasions for you to betray me inaccurately.
I plan to get proper legal action to stop this slime.
I'll alert my solicitor.
That's right. Mock the lunatic.
You didn't make me.
I... made.... you!
His name was Wilson.
I image you have several patients claiming to be possessed...
Yes, it's now too common illusion.
Have you ever had a case you thought could be actually possession?
No.
Well... ah...
We do have one patient who has given me pos?
A defrocked priest, named Nathaniel Ferdistat?
It stepped the immagination of several other patients including Molly.
How many others?
Have they been released?
I'm not sure.
But there is no reason to...
They're may be in danger.
We need to see your records.
No, no, no. You know I can't do that.
The Lord Chief Justice owes me a favour.
I'll be back very soon.
I can't wait to let him finish his lunch.
I need that court order.
Did you tell him who's asking?
Father, let's play some football.
I'm working.
You don't look like you're working...
I'm thinking. For a writer thinking is working.
You're not thinking, you're stomping.
Kingsley! Out!
Stop your whining.
Stop your whining, Arthur!
The world hates your whinge.
Omni immundus spiritus.
Omni satanical potestas.
No, you go to hell I cast out the demon in you.
Go to hell with you!
In name of our lord.
You people mads... disgust, your mental pathetic witling hand me the holy water.
We use this purified water [.....]
.. to banish the creature within you. Damn you!
To lever you on old.. that is unpleasant.
Shut up!
Put that scabbard away!
Stand back!
Cathatonia.
And it's also from Bedlam.
We had access to the records which might have helped us save this man.
Please, stop!
I smell whisky. and despair.
Your children are never rambunctious.
And for professional aims you're spending way to much time with us so I'm guessing you have a major case of writer's block.
Keeping home's dad is pretty more difficult than I thought.
So it weren't worth?
Give people what they want.
More showup is more bore-
Win, win.
It's more complicated than that.
Oh, my god!
Another reaction.
A configuration similar to the one we saw in Molly.
Not similar.
Identical.
This can't be random, it has to be a pattern.
I don't see a pattern.
I think I do. It's real built to spot patterns help us pick out hind predators xxx?
And makes us see faces everywhere: from man to moon to Jesus in a piece of toast.
Sometimes it stays in front of people's head.
Oh, come on. You're playing connect the dots.
You can make anything.
I know where I've seen it before.
All the marks of the bad.
This is helpful, means we have not to wound up all demons...
Just the bad.
His points really suggest a pentagram and Arthur made you clearly looks like a bear.
Abbadon, Lord of the Abyss paralyses his victims with fear so that he may feed on the souls. Leaving his marks on his preys. It is the demonic equivalent to stigmata. Muss skin writing. Some people can cause a spontaneous allergic reaction and unconsciously forming into whatever they want.
It's like... getting a tatoo without a needle.
It's very tricky.
How does one consciously do sometfhing... when one is unconscious?
The very question is why does our Addy have big book with creepy symbols?
It's my husband's.
The ring is marking that.
It's the insignia of Anarchism.
Those guys have done some nasty things.
You think he was involved with these assassins.
I think he was trying to stop them.
That's why he was killed.
They left him hanging in the study for me to find.
I'm Little Guy's Trumsey.
Lordship Justice's office.
Thank you.
Ah!
We have a warrant.
We'll see the priest first, then your records.
Nathaniel.
I've been waiting for you three.
Nice jacket.
I own one just like that home.
Do you know Molly Morgan and Simon Fleming.
They were my acolytes.
I've quite a number of them.
How many?
Molly's dead.
Simon is catatonic.
He has fulfilled that purpose.
The beast must be fed.
One of them is still alive.
But his soul is gone.
I think he uses narcissus.
I need no such trickery.
I corrupt the sense for Abaddon's feed off.
How do you do that?
Spirituals deepest to the end.
And it is a simple matter.
Do you know what I most fear?
Being condemned to the same manner as me.
I see that you are weak.
Prisoner of your first.
And it will be long.
It's enough of that! Guard!
It's never enough!
Abaddon.
It's nothing more than a talented code reader turner.
Grab credit for what happens to the victims.
No code reading can make Molly and Simon behaves as they did.
Or make the mockery badges in their bodies. (???)
Here's another one.
That's 5 patients.
They had contact with Nathaniel and now are out there somewhere.
Time abounds waste to go - What's that one?
Dead patients it's not relevant.
I'll ask xxx to check them down.
You two go. And I will see what Dr. Randall has to say.
I believe permitting one's fears to paper has the effect to defining it and once defined it and can be targeted.
Molly and Simon what was their condition when you released them?
I thought they were cured.
That's arrogant, I know.
Now just sounds foolish.
How a man like this Nathaniel was allowed contact with vulnerable patients?
Not just allowed, encouraged and not by me.
Dr. Pearson believes if we terrify the patients with demons... they will come running to God.
He's using fear to manipulate them.
Fear is the disease itself.
He doesn't understand that.
What about the rest of Dr. Pearson's psychotherapies?
Electroshock or lobotomies?
He assures me he has success.
It's barbaric and you know it.
I have a court order.
I intend to search this place... and find how everything that is going in here and stop the abuse!
And I count on you help or your hindrance.
We have much to discuss.
Can I offer you a cup of tea?
Yes.
Help me!
Get off me.
Stop.
The world hates a witcher B.R.H.

[Dr. Pilsen]
Four of the five released innates have been found in detained, safe and healty. still trying to find an address for the fifth.
It just leaves one question: So, what's in the file you put aside when you saw me approach?
It's the coroner's report on Nigel Pennington.
No water found in lungs.
Likely strangulation.
It's suspicious death.
Police has no leads no suspects.
You want to tell me about this guy?
He was my husband's friend.
And his business partner.
The police said Benjamin gambled all our money away but Nigel thought he'd embezzled it.
My tining were it was well, if I didn't known xxxx.
Nigel was trying to open in questioning if this was a hide and I wanted too.
You don't think your husband gave off the money away.
Benjamin took me to Eifell Tower.
Not to see the structure or enjoy the view. he really kissed at the top of the world.
He wasn't a gambler.
He was a romantic.
Yeah.
Maybe you two were obviously mutually exclusive?
Dr. Pilsen is ruthless and unyielding, devoid of any redeemable human qualities.
He has subjected me to one unspeakable torture after another, each one more horrible than the last.
He has forced me to worship Abaddon and enabled this monster to reveal its hideous visage to me.
There are no words.
You b*st*rd!
Don't, please.
I know what you did to my father.
You stole that file.
I-I could charge you...
Charge me!
Detective!
You tortured him to death.
You... you've been drinking.
Perhaps your wife's condition is too stressful to you.
You can.
If I could give you a teinture of laudano.
I don't need your opium.
You clearly need help to order things something to break you anxiety?
I'm not the crazy one!
Nor was my father!
Your father was savaged from...
Dementia  preacox was a very.
You're going to prison for what you did to him!
What's this?
I'm committing you!
You can't! You can't!
You don't just .... me up!
No! No!
Your father xxxx?
I'm afraid I'm sorry, Arthur.
'Noooo!
Sorry.
No el back yet?
No.
Then, I can't admit he was right.
I know you think abaddon was behind this.
Don't be cute.
I do think that something erratic is going on in that asylum.
I think that we should go back and open every file they have.
I think that we should get on fast.
I've ordered to see my solicitor.
No one even know I'm in here.
Meet your new roommate.
You. And your bloody solicitor!
No, no, this isn't right.
This time it is not so amusing, is it?
What Pilsen is doing is ilegal.
You have to alert Scotland Yard.
Guard!
Guard!
I've been thinking...
Not talking to you.
Name it.
Puffy eyes, you've been drinking heavily.
Apparently.
All you're doing is drink is nurse.
Just the same old long term abuse the devil's muscle one symptom of an even bigger problem.
Fear.
Of course I'm scared. I'm locked in a bloody mental hospital.
What happened? Somebody steal your identity?
and now they call you crazy as soon as you mention your name.
Christi for head daunting eyes stupid pa.xxxxx.
So is the fear is within you your entire life.
Whine.
What's wounded you so profoundly?
More importantly, why did you kill my fictional counterpart?
Han was a white lighting stood in the way of something more profound.
It's a tad more personal and I find interesting to me.
We must... after your father died.
You're true Sherlock over the fons.
I made some inquiries.
Doyle's father was a patient at den. Where he died years ago.
Well, then that explains Doyle's behaviour. And that file.
Let me guess.
Daddy loved you when you became a doctor and hated it when you became a rack although within it every once in a while he did have a inspired term or phrase. They say a little insanity steers the creative juices.
I'm not insane.
Your surroundings suggest otherwise.
Did he ever whatso acknowledge you as a writer?
Sherlock was one of my successful characters in the history of fiction.
Not fiction.
I need to get out of here.
Are you going to embrace your intuition and see this as an opportunity to investigate from inside?
I suppose I could.
Trying find proof that my father was right, proof of abaddon.
I termed down the Abaddon disfocused in Nathaniel.
How did you know about the case?
I hear things.
When thinking of your backing mad known it is descripted so xxxx to matter.
Ah, really, you did?
Professor Moriarty...
An evil stepmother.
The victims died in a state of great fear. They also exhibited dry grangene and parathesis to everything to may be in poison.
You are the fear inducing poison in study in scarlet.
Ergot... causes terrifying allucination.
The house of Charles Doyle offered purchase.
I thought he was just sleeping in but his bed is untouched.
He mustn't come home at all last night.
Daddy?
It's not your father, love.
Where is he?
I'm not sure.
I'm Adelaide.
You must be Kingsley.
Your father told me so much about you.
Mostly good.
I don't like broccoli either.
You're a policeman.
I am.
And we are going to find your father.
I promise.
I think he told Nathaniel, which is why I devised a way to get you into his cell.
A five ways to find me before those animals give in xxxx concussion.
I asked them five?
Guard! Come quick!
Dr. Doyle needs help utterly consumption.
Otherwise at least eight other helmet with manifest similar symptoms.
Look it!
I thought you said this method didn't involve knock him out.
I naild. I just expect you'd disapprove.
Stakes and high enough to justify headache.
Prep xxx and mild brain injury.
You'd better come through.
It's too late for that.
Abaddon has come for me.
Your followers flow.
We think they were poisoned.
Yeah.
Abaddon lost this Milice.
Your father ricketed of it.
How would you know about my father?
He died eight years ago, before you came to Bedlam.
Badness always been here... is everywhere the true has been xxx?
Your father xxx good to weakness so easy to squeeze life out of him.
He's girding you!
Do you wak to Pilsen?
I have but one master.
As does the Pilsen's access to a pattern.
That's why he brought me here.
Act you.
This is impossible.
Apparently not.
Doyle!
What have you done?
No. I didn't even tie.
I just came to talk to him.
He was tactic garden!
No, I've never touched him.
Some force... wrenched his neck.
He said Abaddon was coming for him. Tell him!
He dragged me in here. I had no idea he was going to do this.
What? No!
Tell him. Wait!
No! He's lying.
No! No! No!
I liked your father.
But I failed him.
Even if I've here I'm sure he would be alive and be grateful today.
It will xxxx your writing, but it's a small price to bury xxxx xxxxxx.
Doyle! Doyle!
No, no, no!
No, please!
I need to write.
Ease. Relax.
Just relax.
Excuse me.
Please, don't drill into my friend's brain.
Attendent!
They are indisposed.
By indisposed, I mean... unconscious.
Let me apologize in advance to rendering you... unconscious as well.
What do you say?
By earlier to betrayal was just ruth.
I had sixty to ablutions xxxxx???
only if you'd like the most satisfying conclusion.
Wait! Wait!
Fergus was in an early draught of the studing scholar.
But I caught it before it went to print.
How could you know about it?
We're in the middle of this thrilling escape.
What did you think of...
Come on!
There's our way out.
No!
Doyle!
There must be a logical out to this.
Nothing is making sense!
Whenever I'm lying, you steal for me.
What you eliminate as impossible.
Whatever remains... everything here is impossible.
And therefore?
everything is a signal to my imagination.
Including you.
I'm just like everything deuce.
I've been giver ergot.
I'm allucinating.
The real me is dying.
Convulsions... shock, oedema.
My best guess is some sort of poison.
Unfortunately it is impossible to tell which one.
Ergot.
Yes!
Ergot concerning explains all the symptoms.
How did you ever think of that?
Lucky guess.
Daddy?
Kingsley.
We found him and we're going to make it better.
Good as new.
Alright?
I'm afraid the children can't be in here.
No! We're not leaving our father!
We are throwing them out?
Now that I xxx, there's nothing I can do for him.
You have to find a way out of your life now.
Arthur!
Tully!
I haven't given up. I've been searching the world for a cure.
Well, stop searching. As I felt wonderful.
He said ergot take 12 hours to peak.
Both victims had their breakdown the day they were released which means they were at Bethlem when they were poisoned Nathaniel confined himself so... that lets him out of the hook.
When'd everyone else were scared peak to death.
Thrills?
The only ones with access to the victims were Pilsen and Randall.
But the only time Doyle saw Pilsen he was with us.
And the only time he wasn't with us he met Randall.
You think 'I' poisoned him?
I'm trying to figure it out why anybody would kill people in such a torturous way...
But you're a scientist.
You're not trying to kill the failures, you're trying to kill the mothers.
The way Pasteur inoculated people against rabies by giving them small dosis.
And how do you suppose I administered this... poison?
It's called ergot.
As some kind of rife fungus.
And we were wondering the same thing.
How the heck do you get... rife fungus in some way?
Bread I suppose.
Certain drinks, beer and alcohol.
Tea?
Like any good scientist you wouldn't take experiment with something you can't control.
I think you have an antidote.
Why would I have an antidote...?
.. to a poison I don't have?
You'd better have.
Because I xxx your tea were eregot.
I do the sure thing professional.
Stop you before you took poison to any other poor people.
What are you doing?
You can't kill me! -I think you would give us the antidote before that.
No. Don't do this.
I'm so close.
If I can kill fear.
It is.
Save so many lives from ruin.
Yes. All those dies you caused, will you undo?
You told me you knew how to sail.
Like you told me you know how to ski.
'Cause I can ski.
Take me to Mont Blanc and I will show you.
Yes, of course you can.
Because you're not real.
Why does that matter?
The feelings are real.
It's not enough?
That's everything.
I must go back.
You have to want me die.
I know.
Then, why?
Why go back to all that pain?
That torment...
Because it's real.
It's the pain that is real, and so is the joy.
Was about me?
You're a dream.
A beautiful dream.
I'm sorry.
Good bye, my love.
Is it the dream like?
That's the product ofyour dying brain.
There's not much time left.
There must be a way out of this.
Ergot is the surge on real vendor.
Can you possibly do abandon that?
Euphoria.
It's massive surge which spikes all calcium to constrict peripheral blood vessels.
Probably kill me.
It's the only thing that will physically stop the encore.
How might I feel euphoria in this place?
By eliminating... your misery.
What is causing all the dark memories of this house, son?
Go on, say it.
Father.
In the flesh. So to speak.
Am I dead?
No, Arthur.
You're losing your mind.
Out of way!
No, no, no, no!
You're alright?
Yes.
Surprising thing that all your problems are my fault.
Do you deny that you didn't have the faintest idea how to be a father?
Yes, I was a troubled father.
All better now?
b*st*rd.
Hum. Hard enough.
So that's it?
What is this really about?
Oh, I know.
Your precious work.
Most fathers would be proud of what I created.
Sherlock Holmes.
The most skeptical asshole who ever lived.
You hated my work because it was a fictional character.
Character who was contemptous with everything that I was.
Character you made up that way with the sole purpose of hurting me.
Of course I wanted to hurt you.
You were an alcoholic madman.
And the best day of my life was the day they took you away.
You know that's not true.
There, now.
Steady, steady.
Dr. Doyle.
Steady... steady.
The alcohol was my fault, the madness was not.
And whose fault was it, mine?
It was no one fault.
Do you know how miserable I was?
To have such a lunatic for a father.
Do you know the utter horror of losing one's mind?
At first, I tried to justify, it was a quark of creative brain.
Then I tried to camouflage with alcohol.
It bottled to the piano.
Better a lash than a nut case.
But I kept thinking deeper and deeper until it took everything from me.
My work...
Your dear mother...
Your brothers and sisters...
You.
Hum!
Quite the  xxx?
Would this all of this be different if I remained the doctor?
Probably.
If it was anyone that I read your work to I came to despise you.
It was my work that awful?
No.
Her father and brothers were aclaimed artists.
I was...
The disappointment...
And you came along and it was so easy for you.
Your brilliance illuminated my mediocrity.
My death didn't warrant a single obituary in the newspaper.
And yet the entire world mourned the death of your cartoon.
Why couldn't you tell me?
Because I was a weak... and a petty little man.
I didn't despise you.
I despised myself.
I know it's to late, but... but would you allow me to do something that I wish I had the courage to do when I was alive?
Thank you.
But you were thinking that this was a shade to fuss out.
And you will just realise I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Precisely.
Hum, I thank you to take my word for it.
Daddy?
Come here, son.
I was never cross with you.
Nor you.
I was cross with myself.
You gave Adelaide and your kids a hell of a scare.
Yes, all three of us.
It wasn't Pilsen, was it?
It was Randall.
How could you possibly learn that?
Holmes cracked the case.
Up here, the case was cracked by Houdini.
Figured out that your poison was Ergot.
How could you poss...?
No!
No. I don't know what are you thinking but put off that grin off your face.
They must've communicated that to you telepathically.
Or... it came to me in one of my frequent bursts of inspiration.
And where did that inspiration come from?
Please, let him have the last word.
And one last signature.
Thank you, Dr.  Doyle.
Thank you.
I love you, ma.
