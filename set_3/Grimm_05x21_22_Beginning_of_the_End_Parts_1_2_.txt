We got you on breaking and entering, assaulting an officer, drugs in your car.
Now, why'd you pick that house?
What were you after?
We've got a problem.
What do you want me to do?
Cooperate.
So you don't want to talk.
Then I guess you won't be needing your mouth.
I think it saved Monroe's life.
He was bitten on his arm. The wound healed.
It completely disappeared.
It's not just a stick.
Damn, that's kind of big.
Thank you, everyone!
I have a lot of people I need to thank tonight, but I would like to begin with the love of my life and the mother of my children, Adalind.
Come here, you.
[cheers and applause continue]
You're dead.
In a remarkable campaign that was put together after the assassination of the party candidate, Police Captain Sean Renard has won a decisive victory in the race for mayor.
How could Adalind do this to Nick?
Unbelievable.
There's not even a word to describe this.
I can't believe this is even happening.
I can't imagine what must be going on in Nick's head right now.
I can.
Renard wanted me to join Black Claw.
I'm sure he did.
Having you on their side would be advantageous.
Her too. Why do they want us?
To control Wesen that won't agree with their agenda.
Grimms have always been very good at that.
Black Claw will use the system at first...
Getting elected into office.
Once they're there, they're gonna start making changes.
Lower-level positions at first.
Power grid, fire department, then the police.
They'll work their way up all the way to council members, commissioners, assistant district attorneys, heads of department.
Zuri wasn't trying to recruit me.
No, she was just trying to figure out what kind of information you have.
They're gonna try and take down everyone around the Grimm.
This won't be a war you can fight alone, and friends make you vulnerable.
I've gotten as much out of her as I could.
Is she...
She's not dead.
Good... I think.
What'd you get?
She was recruited by Black Claw 5 1/2 months ago, specifically to go after Hank.
She suggested that it wasn't a decision she was happy with, but she said she was sorry.
But I think she was just trying to play on my sympathies.
Bet that didn't go down so well.
What about contacts?
She resisted, but I convinced her to dig deeper.
Sounds uncomfortable.
It was.
She gave up a name: Bonaparte.
Conrad Bonaparte? He's here?
You know him?
He's one of the founders of Black Claw.
If he's here, he's running the operation.
So what are you gonna do with Zuri?
She's being taken to a secure site.
[cell phone rings]
Griffin.
It's dispatch.
3045 Hudson Street?
Yeah, thanks.
Something wrong with that address?
Yeah, it's mine.
We'll check in with you later.
Can you just... can you turn the TV off?
It's like I can't even listen to that right now.
[TV clicks off]
And that damn truck is still out there.
How long is this supposed to go on?
I think this is just starting.
Well, I'm sick of it.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna tell them to get off our damn street.
Monroe...
No!
We are not living like this!
Monroe!
Monroe! Monroe!
Don't do this! They could have guns!
I just want to find out who they voted for.
Hey, guys. How are you doing? Are you lost or something?
I mean, you've been sitting out here for a long time.
Will you stop?
I mean, you must be getting kind of tired of looking at our house by now, because we're sure as hell getting tired of looking at you looking at our house.
[engine roaring]
What do you think you're doing?
What I should have done a long time ago.
I'm sorry. This is our home.
We are letting those idiots rule our lives.
I know, but getting yourself killed is not gonna make our lives any better, thank you very much.
[sighs]
I'm sorry, but this is just...
It's getting out of hand.
[groans]
Are you okay?
[exhales deeply] Just a little stressed.
I know. I'm sorry. I'm sure I'm not helping.
Yeah, you feel a little warm.
That's because I'm angry.
Here's the license plate to the truck.
I thought we should call Trubel and give it to her.
At least one of us wasn't being stupid.
Do you need any help with the kids?
We can manage. Thanks.
Let's get you to bed.
Congratulations on this victory.
I obviously wouldn't be here without you.
No, but you won the election legitimately.
I won. Let's just leave it at that.
It's politics. Nothing's ever what it seems.
But this is just the first step.
Now we need your new life with Adalind to work if we're going to move forward.
It's not entirely up to me.
Would you mind if I talked to her?
Would it matter if I did?
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, honey.
You were very good tonight.
We love you.
Good night, Mommy. Good night, Daddy.

Are there detectives here?
Yes, sir, inside.
But they're in the middle of the investigation.
Well, this is my house.
Oh.
They're definitely gonna want to talk to you, then.
Go ahead.
I've never seen these guys before.
I have.
Sorry, I'm in a hurry. [gunshot]
What?
These guys are Black Claw.
How do you know that?
They were following me.
When?
Last night.
You did this?
I didn't have a choice.
I was on my way to HW.
Somebody's setting you up.
Who let you in?
This is my house.
I'm Detective Griffin.
Detective Burkhardt.
We got a call from dispatch, thought it was a mistake.
Boyd Baribeau, North Precinct. This is Kate Masters.
Want to tell us what two dead guys are doing in your living room?
I have no idea.
Uh uh.
He couldn't have done this.
He's been with me most of the night.
Most of the night might not be enough.
You sound like you know what happened here.
If these two guys were killed here, there would be blood all over the floor.
We have a witness.
Who?
Neighbor. Called 911.
Reported a gunshot and yelling earlier tonight.
And described an African-American male...
40s, about 6 foot tall, positively identified as Police Detective Hank Griffin, running out of the house at about 10:00 this evening.
Well, they're wrong.
What neighbor told you that?
A Mrs. Miller. Lives across the street.
You know how this works.
We're gonna have to take you in for questioning.
We'll clear this thing up.
So anything you say can and will be used against you.
We're gonna need your badge and gun.
Let's go.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
These bodies were dumped here.
I don't want to have to explain how a police detective contaminated a crime scene.
Let's go.
[engine turning over]
Wu, sorry to wake you up. We've got a problem.
Meet me at the precinct.
I'll tell you when I get there.
Be there in 15.
[engine turning over]
Conrad Bonaparte.
Very little we know about him, and what we do know is not very helpful.
He's in his 40s, maybe 50s.
He lives in Prague, Paris, Macau, you take your pick.
And he's either from Morocco, Egypt, Budapest, or Iran.
So we know nothing of value.
We do know he's a very bad man.
Got something you should see.
This is the laptop Nick brought in.
Belongs to Tony Talamonti, the guy who stole Hank's phone.
We know Black Claw is watching everybody.
But now they're making sure everybody has them.
Every single one of these photos was shared over the Internet.
This is more than just surveillance.
[cell phone rings]
It's Monroe.
Take it.
Monroe, I'm with Eve and Meisner.
You're on speaker.
Yeah, that's great.
I didn't even know if I'd get you.
Uh, yeah, no...
I just had a little confrontation with the, um, Black Claw guys stationed outside my house.
You need clean-up?
I didn't go that far, not that I didn't want to.
But, uh, look, Rosalee got their license plate.
Give it to us.
They still out there?
No, no, they took off when I, you know, went out to have a little chat.
Plus, next time I see them,
I'd like to address them by their first names.
We'll let you know what we find out.
Sounds good.
It's in our system.
Truck is registered to 521 Skyline Drive.
It's the same address we got off the Black Claw operatives we killed in Nevada.
Map it.
Find out everything about it and what's around it.
Then we go see 'em.
Why aren't you asleep?
I don't know.
[sighs heavily]
Maybe this is why you're not asleep.
How come you and Daddy don't like each other?
Well, we haven't spent a lot of time together.
And sometimes that makes people not know each other very well.
But you can't push people together, especially not a mommy and daddy.
You understand?
I don't like Rachel.
Why not?
Because she likes Daddy.
That's not something you have to worry about.
Now, it's been a long day, and you need to get some sleep, okay?
Will you stay with me?
Sure.
Just so you don't feel guilty, I wasn't sleeping anyway.
What's the problem?
Somebody dumped two bodies at Hank's house.
What? Who killed 'em?
I did. Why is not important right now.
But somebody wants Hank to take the fall for it.
And there's a witness: Hank's neighbor, Mrs. Miller.
This is her.
There's a witness for something he didn't do that you did?
No record. Retired schoolteacher.
Been in the same house for 30 years.
Okay, that makes her sound kind of reliable.
Either she's being forced to lie by Black Claw, or she is Black Claw.
Either way, we're gonna have to talk to her.
Get out.
Okay.
This isn't right.
You need to answer some questions.
So we're not doing this by the book.
Not exactly.
But I'm sure you're pretty familiar with that.
I guess if you're gonna shoot...
[choking]
We need him alive.
Not for much longer.
We've got him.
That's her car. She should be home.
How do you want to handle this?
If she's Black Claw, she's gonna know why we're here.
Yeah, but if she's not Black Claw, she may be too scared to talk to us.
No matter what she is, she's not innocent.
She lied. You take the back.
[knock at door]
[whispering] Nick, back door's open.
[normal voice] House is clear. No Mrs. Miller.
I think we should go with the "she was forced to lie" theory.
Check the 911 call.
See what phone it was made from and what time.
I'm gonna talk to the detectives that took her statement.
If their witness is gone, they can't hold Hank.
Yep.
I'm glad you came over.
Oh.
So am I.
But you can't stay the night.
I know.
I have an image to protect now.
[sighs]
I'm gonna miss this.
We don't have to stop.
I'm afraid we do.
Adalind needs to understand how important family values are to the Cause.
Our relationship isn't helping.
Well, it's helping me.
Get out.

Hi. Detective Burkhardt.
I'm looking for Detectives Masters and Baribeau.
Yeah? You got a problem?
Yeah, I got a problem.
Hey, Lieutenant.
Yeah.
Got a Detective Burkhardt over here who's got a problem.
Detective Burkhardt.
What is your problem?
My problem is a case being handled by Detectives Masters and Baribeau.
They brought in my partner, Detective Griffin.
Well, that's too bad, but...
I don't think your partner's here.
You're right, Lieutenant. No Detective Griffin here.
I feel real sorry for you, Detective Burkhardt.
You must be very frustrated.
What the hell's going on here?
You're in the wrong place, Grimm.
No one's gonna help you here.
Where's my partner?
Got a problem, Lieutenant?
No, I got a Grimm asking for help.
Maybe you haven't heard. We got ourselves a new mayor.
Things are changing around here.
And they already have.
Go ahead. Let's see what you got.
Maybe next time.
How much longer do we have to wait?
If I knew, I'd tell you.
Why isn't he here?
If I knew, I'd tell you.
Call him.
I'm not calling him.
If you want to call him, go ahead.
I don't like waiting.
Neither do I.
We should just kill him and get the hell out of here.
Your partner killed two of our people.
You don't think there's consequences for something like that?
I believe in consequences... for everybody.
Yeah.
And you're gonna be first.
Something doesn't feel right.
Then call him.
I'm telling you, something's not right here.
Yes, I did.
Please, have a seat.
Adalind, I know you're not in love with Sean.
I'm doing the best I can.
I don't believe you are.
Well, you're not a woman.
I'm not asking you to be in love.
Then what are you asking me?
I want you to think about the children, about how important their future is.
If I wasn't thinking about what's best for my children, I wouldn't be here.
I know that.
Sean just isn't my type.
And, unfortunately, that's not gonna change.
[chuckles]
Adalind... [sighs]
You need to know something about me.
I'm not like Sean.
There is more to me than that.
We need to understand each other on a deeper level.
And if you're going to be stubborn about it...
Then you should look like what you are.
Now, is this really how you want your children to see you?
Hmm?
[gasps]
I'm sorry.
That hurt... a lot.
Sometimes a point has to be made.
But we're not asking you to do this for nothing.
What's that?
A wedding ring.
You are a princess, and Sean will be your prince.
People love a fairy tale.
[chuckles]
It's beautiful.
Oh, one more thing... do not take this ring off, because it will be extremely painful... for your children.
It's very nice.
Thank you.
Mm.
You're most welcome.
You check the 911 call?
Yep.
It took a while, because I had to check every call for a ten-hour period, only to find out no call was made.
No 911 call came in from Mrs. Miller?
Or from anyone else.
There were no crimes reported on Hank's street at all.
What'd you get?
The detectives who took Hank are Black Claw.
How'd you find that out?
I just got back from the precinct.
Almost every cop I saw was Wesen.
What?
And they all knew I was a Grimm.
And they're holding Hank there?
They said he's not there. I don't know where he is.
Even if he is, I can't get to him, at least not alone.
Check and see if they booked him.
If they did, he'll be in the system.
Nope, nothing.
They haven't filed any paperwork, so whatever they're up to, it's not by the book.
These guys are Black Claw.
The charge is bogus, and they know it.
I doubt they even took him in.
Then how are we gonna find him?
Do we still have the guy who Hank brought in for the B&E?
Tony Talamonti, yeah. He's still in holding.
He's Black Claw.
He's got to be connected to this.
He's got to know something.
Yeah, well, he already knows I'm a Grimm.
So you can't just scare it out of him.
No.
We need someone who he knows has a real reason to kill him.
[store bell tinkles]
Nick.
You have any customers?
Not at the moment. What's up?
[store bell tinkles]
Black Claw has Hank.
What?
No!
We're trying to figure out where they have him.
We've got a guy who I think might know.
Who?
Tony.
Tony.
Tony.
We still have him in custody.
He stole Hank's cell phone, so we know he was assigned to Hank.
I'll get it out of him.
But you can't kill him.
He just has to believe you will.
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
I want you to go in first.
I want you to identify him as the guy who attacked you in this shop.
No!
I can do that.
Why?
You're her husband.
He attacked your wife.
I want him to know this is personal.
Oh, it's personal.
When do you want to do it?
Now.
I got nothing to say.
Yeah, we know.
So what are we gonna do? Stare at each other?
Something like that.
Two detectives took my partner.
You mean the guy that arrested me?
Gee, I'm really sorry to hear that.
Where did they take him?
Hmm... don't know.
How'd you hurt your hand, Tony?
Tripped.
Over a Hexenbiest?
Pretty, blonde, about this tall?
I bet you were feeling pretty tough at the time.
Where'd they take Hank, Tony?
Let me think, uh... [clicking tongue]
Barbados.
Is this the guy who hit you?
Yeah, that's him.
Well, look what happened to me!
If you know where Hank is, tell them.
You're still so pretty, Rosie, especially when you're upset.
It's all right. It's okay. It's okay.

I guess we'll be adding an assault.
Yeah, sure, just add it to my list.
It's not your assault.

Nick actually attacked him?

Inside the precinct?
He couldn't be stopped.
I got to say, I'm surprised he held it together as long as he did.
I mean, the guy took his kid.
And Adalind.
And killed Meisner?
Renard could charge Nick with assault or attempted murder.
Nick won't last the night.
Black Claw will get to him.
We got to get him out of there.
With a precinct full of cops?
How are we gonna do that?
You're not. We will.
You need to get to the spice shop and hide anything you don't want Black Claw to find.
Hide, like where?
I mean, we've got all the books and the drawings...
And weapons.
Black Claw can't get their hands on any of that stuff.
I think we got to move it out of the basement...
No, it is too late to move anything.
Black Claw will be watching.
Hide it the best you can.
What about the opening to the old sewer line?
Yeah.
I don't think anybody would look down there.
I know I wouldn't.
Okay, then get back to the loft.

Do we know who did it?
Someone who didn't like her very much.
Where's Adalind?
She's upstairs.
But I don't think Adalind even knew about your relationship with Rachel.
And even if she did, she doesn't care enough about you to have done anything about it.
Well, somebody had the ability to do it.
It wasn't me.
Then who?
I didn't think she was capable at such a young age, but maybe she is.
Diana?
She could've perceived Rachel as a threat to her mother and you and her family.

Would she need to?
All right, everything should fit in here.

Oh, my God, this is one of the books my uncle Felix died for.
Oh, the Grimm ancestry book.
Can you imagine if Black Claw got a hold of this?
They could hunt down and kill every Grimm.
There is no way they are getting their stinking hands on this baby.
You okay?
Is your stomach still bothering you?
Um... no, I was just thinking... what if Black Claw is successful?
What's the world gonna be like?
Black Claw is not gonna be successful, not as long as I'm alive, anyway.

Take what we can to Nick's, I guess.

In the hands of another Grimm, a Mr. Josef Nebojsa in Prague.
We tracked it to a book dealer in Leipzig and then here to Portland.
Turns out the book dealer who bought it is related to a friend of yours.
The book dealer was Blutbaden, yet he chose to give the book to a Grimm.
I believe that you now have that book, and you will give it to me.
All of this for a book?
The book is one of a kind.
It documents every Grimm, living or dead.
