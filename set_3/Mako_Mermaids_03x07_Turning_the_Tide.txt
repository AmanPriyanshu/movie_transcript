: Hey!
It almost hit me!
The full moon will bring the dragon. We have to sharpen our reflexes.
Does it have to move so fast?
: Nice shot, Rita.
: You won't get a chance to miss with the dragon.
Again.
 I like this ball.
I'm so sorry, Rita. I didn't mean to.
That's quite okay, Weilan.
: That thing you did was incredible.
What was it?
It's a form of Eastern mermaid self-defense. Am I right?
Turn the tide.
Its purpose is to turn magic back on itself.
It must have taken you ages to master it.
It's very difficult to learn.
Eastern mermaids are taught it from when they're hatchlings.
 So it's not that special.
Except that no Southern mermaid has ever mastered it.
"Locate and catalog a marine ecosystem."
How hard can that be?
Doing a biology assignment on the weekend? It's not hard, it's torture.
I've already scoped out Mako. The rock pools are ideal.
Hundreds of species living in symbiotic harmony.
Sounds perfect.
Except, I can't go.
I have to work. So you guys have to do the assignment without me.
This was meant to be a group project.
If it's that important, Ondina and I could cover your shift for you.
What?
I don't know, Mimmi.
It's a lot of responsibility.
Yeah, Mimmi.
I've been a customer here long enough to know what to do, and Ondina already has some experience.
: Thanks.
I really appreciate it.
No problem.
My time as a waitress wasn't pretty, remember?
And besides, I planned on mastering Weilan's little party trick today.
You're going to learn turn the tide? Just like that?
If Weilan can do it, how hard can it be?
Turn the what?
: Weilan knows this awesome technique.
She can turn magic force around and throw it back where it came from.
So she can turn magic back on itself?
Mmm.
Turn the tide. Show it to me.
I want a demonstration.
Why?
Humor me.
Okay.
Zap me.
Well, I don't want to hurt you.
 You won't.
Okay.
Ow.
I never said you wouldn't hurt yourself.
You got back exactly what you sent at me.
If you'd sent me a gentle breeze, you would have gotten that back.
 What about cold dragon fire?
Forget it. It can't be done.
Well, why not? It's a defensive move, right?
We can turn it into an attacking move.
Teach me.
If I can turn the dragon fire back on itself, maybe I can destroy it.
The entire Eastern pod, including tenth level mermaids, lost their powers to this creature.
What makes you any different?
I'm a merman.
I've saved the pod before. I can do it again.
It takes years to master this technique.
You think you can do it in a couple of days?
We'll never know if you don't give me a chance.
There should be some seafood arriving soon.
And make sure the drink fridge is stocked from the back.
The back. Got it.
Don't worry, David. Everything is under control.
You don't have to worry about a thing.
Thanks again.
This is going to be awesome.
I was up till midnight researching a rare species of algae that's unique to the area.
And I thought this was going to be a boring trip.
Where's Evie?
Oh, she said she'd meet us there.
Why use a boat when you can use a tail, right?
: 
We're meant to do this assignment together.
I have another idea for it.
And since when?
You get going and we'll talk when you get back.
You don't mind lying to Evie?
 Of course I mind.
But she can't know about this or she'll try and talk me out of it.
Mmm. So would the others.
Mmm.
What we're doing is very dangerous.
So it has to be our secret, all right?
Well, are you going to order?
You've been sitting here for five minutes.
If you don't know what you want to eat, you're obviously not hungry.
Trouble with the customer?
I know. Rude, huh?
Is something on your mind?
No.
Come on.
Ondina, you've been grouchy all morning.
 It doesn't make sense that Eastern mermaids can do things we can't.
It's not like we're made differently.
You're still thinking about turn the tide?
Northern mermaids can do things that Southern mermaids can't.
It's never bothered you before.
Who's bothered? I'm just saying.
Okay. Conjure me a water ball.
What? In here?
Yes. I'm going to master this.
Fine.
That was way too fast!
Not for an Eastern mermaid.
When you're done... maybe you could try your hand at clearing plates.
: There's a clearing inland. It's totally hidden. It'll be perfect.
Slow down, Zac. You need to know the ground rules.
You must do everything I say.
No arguing. I'm in charge.
Understand?
Okay.
This is going to be the hardest thing you've ever done.
Trust me. You're going to wish you'd never asked for it.
I think I can handle it. 
We'll see.
Okay.
What's first?
Do this.
Back straight, feet apart, right leg forward.
Good.
Hmm.
Won't I be in the water on the night?
Once you've mastered the technique, you'll be able to do it anywhere, in the water or on land.
Arms slightly forward, bent at the elbow.
Like this.
Here, let me show you.
Whoa. What was that?
This isn't a race.
The dragon won't take it slow.
You need to focus on getting the move right first.
I got the move.
No, I say when you've got it and you're not even close.
Now watch and copy me again.
Ready?
 Yes.
Okay, show me.
Good. Now give me 60 like that.
Sixty?
No arguing, remember?
One.
One.
Two.
Three.
Ugh! Stupid move!
David! Fish is here!
Oi! It's staff only back there.
Hello, Joe.
David's gone for the day.
He has an important assignment with school so... I'm taking his place.
You?
Mmm.
 Where's Cam?
He's gone, too.
Can I do something for you?
Yeah, you can. You can grab your stuff and you can go.
I'm taking over.
What?
You're not trained in proper food handling.
David should know better.
But...
: Wait!
No, don't go in there!
And what are you doing in here?
Uh...
Ondina's helping David, too. She's, uh... cleaning the cool room.
Well, I'll be having words with David.
Go on. Out!
Come on, vamoose! Let's go! 
: What kept you?
Yes, well, as a fish, you do have an unfair advantage.
Find any good rock pools?
Take your pick.
The place is teeming with life.
This is going to be so great.
Where's Zac?
Oh, he just decided at the last minute that he had a better idea for the assignment.
What?
: He didn't say.
That's weird.
That's my boyfriend.
Come on.
Okay, that was 60.
I've got it. I'm ready to go.
Another 60.
No, no, no. I'm good to go.
What part of me being in charge do you not understand?
Please. I'm going to surprise you.
Okay.
What was I meant to be surprised by?
Another 60...
One.
 We have to get rid of the water ball before he sees it.
 Now.
Oi!
Out.
Unbelievable.
: Joe?
There is a flying ball of water in there.
Are you okay? You look... pale.
 No...
It's in there. It looked right at me.
I think you need to sit down and have a drink of water.
: Yeah.
Here, bally-ball.
Here, ball.
No.
Forty-eight.
Forty-nine.
Can we take a break? I'm busting a sweat here.
Forty-nine.
You were probably dehydrated.
I mean, that can affect your vision.
You think I'm seeing things?
Come on. I'll show you.
Come on. No, come on.
I really don't think that's a good idea.
: Maybe you need to eat something.
I can make you a sandwich. It's really no problem.
Oh... 
I think I need a rest.
I don't understand. It was right here.
: It's a hot day.
The temperature probably made you see something.
Maybe.
How did you...
I was... I was just...
Shall we go?
Good idea.
Bye, Joe.
Bye. 
: I didn't know soldier crabs lived this far north.
And there's heaps of them in here.
: That's really interesting.
Carly, can we file that under "I think we've got enough. Can we go home now?"
I need some more photos first.
Is there any more water?
I'll get some. There's a spring nearby.
: Watch out for leeches.
Get up.
You think the dragon's going to wait for you?
Get up.
You were right. I can't do this. Not in a day.
You're thinking about it too much.
Of course I'm thinking about it. What do you expect me to do?
Defend yourself.
How?
What are you doing?
That is not funny.
You did it! You turned the tide!
 I did it!
Thank you so much.
I couldn't have done it without you.
So this was your new idea?
 Evie, stop, stop! This is not what you think it is.
The others are waiting for me.
You should get back to whatever it is you two were doing.
Evie!
Evie?
Evie!
: Evie!
Evie!
: Zac?
Evie... what you saw on Mako, it was nothing.
It didn't look like nothing.
Weilan was showing me some Eastern magic. That's it.
You ditched me to hang out with her.
When she told me about these cool Eastern spells, I couldn't wait to try them out.
And you know what it's like.
Magic versus schoolwork, it's not a hard choice to make, right?
You could have let me know.
You would have told me to get back to work on my assignment.
You're right. I would have.
You're lucky David took a lot of notes.
I promise you... there is nothing going on between me and Weilan.
I can't believe you did that today.
Okay. Maybe I got a bit carried away.
A bit? You're obsessed!
I am not obsessed.
 Weilan only gets under your scales because she is like you.
She is not like me.
Headstrong, gifted, always thinks she's right.
Sound familiar?
She is not that gifted.
 You could just ask her to teach you turn the tide, and in return, you could teach her something.
Hmm. Like?
Um...
Like?
Oh, hang on.
I mean, I'll think of something.
: Everything is good with Evie now.
: Are you sure she won't get in our way?
Yeah. I just feel awful about lying to her.
It's for her own safety.
Yeah, I guess.
At least now I've a real shot at destroying this dragon.
Make no mistake, Zac.
This will be the most dangerous thing you've ever done.
Yeah, I get that.
Do you?
When a mermaid is caught by the dragon, they lose their tail and their powers for life.
Nobody knows what will happen to a merman.
