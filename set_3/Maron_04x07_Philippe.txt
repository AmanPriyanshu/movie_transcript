Hi.
You're just sitting there?
Are you shy?
No, I-I mean... I-I mean, I'm in the shower.

Nothing I haven't seen before.
O-O-Okay, but it's... it's me.
It's... It's my... my stuff.
I'm thinking maybe pasta.
Well, it's just, uh, a little weird, you know, talking to somebody in the shower.
I-I don't think I've ever done it with someone that I'm not, you know...
Uh, whatever. Whatever. It doesn't matter.
Marc, I don't have any sexual feelings for you at all.

What the hell you doing here?
You know, I'm just shopping, you know, food, that kind of thing.
Me too.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What, did you forget which car is yours?
I'm just looking for some change.
I wanted to see if I could borrow a few bucks. I lost my wallet.
Yeah. I got to be honest with you, Bobby. I'm a little low on funds myself.
[Sighs] I'm sorry. I just heard you got out of a rehab, so...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, man, all right, well, it was good seeing you, buddy.
I...
Where you going?
I've been sober for two years, man, without a slip.
I'm feeling great. What do you think?
Sober? For real?
Can you believe that?
You?
Ever since I saw you two years ago, you inspired me and whatnot, and here we are.
Oh, my God, that's great, Bobby.
Isn't it ironic?
It is, yeah.
: Marc, come on!
You living with your mom now? That's tremendous.
Let me tell you something... it's good to have family around.
That's why I'm in L.A. I got a little family here, whatnot.
No, it's not my mom.
Yeah, she takes in, uh, sober guys, gives them a place to live, that kind of stuff, you know?
Like a... Like a boarding house.
Well, it's just me and her.
What do you mean? One bed?
No, dude, I... No. I got my own room.
It's normal, you know?
Yeah.
It's not normal. It's not.
I-I can't even explain what's happening.
Marc, who's your friend?
Hi. Shirley, this is Bobby.
Nice to meet you.
Bobby, Shirley.
Hello.
I'm looking at you guys. This is a weird pair.
I can't see you guys sitting around the house watching TV all day.
Y-You should come to dinner.
We're... We're having pasta.
I just... I just helped pick out the sauce.
Absolutely.
All right, buddy.
All right?
Good.
Great to see you, always.

Nice to meet you.
Who was that?
That's Bobby Mendez.
He's an old comic, road guy. You know, he, uh... he used to have a big coke problem. I guess he's sober now.
Well, I don't like the look of him.
And, Marc, you can't just ask people over for dinner without asking me.
I'm sorry, but I thought it would be good to have a sober friend over to the house, you know?
Ahh. [Scoffs]
It'd be weird to uninvite him now.
Well, next time... please ask.

You know, when I get down to eating, this is it.
I got a big hole to fill.

That was something to watch.
Wow.
Did I ever tell you about that time I bought coke off the neo-Nazis?
I don't think so.
Tremendous.
Yeah?
I was down in Beaumont three days eating Valiums like a pirate.
All of a sudden, the last night, I'm out of blow.
I got a victim in the hotel room.
Right.
I call my buddy.
He's like, "Listen, I'm gonna take you to get an 8-ball, but these guys are neo-Nazis, you know?"
Yeah.
And I'm Cuban.
Right.
I figured they were gonna hate me, but I just show up with four $100 bills.
Even people who hate don't hate Ben Franklin.

That's right.

Listen, I'm thinking of hitting the meeting, but if we go, we got to go right now.
You have obligations here.
Yeah, but I can do the dishes later. A meeting would be good.
I mean, you know how important they are for sobriety.
Meetings are fine if you're with the right people.
Oh. I get it.
It's about me.
I'm not the right people.
That is fat-shaming.

It's just a meeting.
I really need one.
I'll be back in a couple hours.

What is up with that old broad?
What? She's nice. She's just strict, you know, set in her ways.
You gray-diving her?
No, I'm not gray-diving her. I don't even think that's a term.
You knew what I was saying.
Yeah.
Then it's a term.
Mm.
Context.
So, if you're not gray-diving her, why are you there?
Marc, it's not the best environment for you to stay sober in... by turning your back on your way of life?
I'm sitting there during dinner thinking, "He's either banging her, or this is nuts!"
I'm not banging her. Would you stop with that?
She's like 90.
Listen, my point is that avoiding life is not the trap you want to fall into right now.
That ain't sobriety.
Tonight I'm gonna teach you about sobriety...
