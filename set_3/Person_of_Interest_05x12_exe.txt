Harold, that's ancient history.
I know, but I sometimes think if we'd have kept trying, maybe it would have worked.
Maybe we'd have stopped those other attacks.
Or the attacks might have happened regardless.
We made a choice that was right for us.
And you can bet if the government wants a system like that, they'll have it someday, if they don't have it already.
And we dodged a bullet not getting in bed with those CIA bastards.
If anything had went wrong, we'd have taken the fall for it.

Funny, it sounded like a demand.

Autonomy.
It's always required your permission, because it never had your trust.
