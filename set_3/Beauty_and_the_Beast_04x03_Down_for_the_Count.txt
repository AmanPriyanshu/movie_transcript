 Beauty & the Beast.
Are you a doctor?
I'm the EMT who brought you in.
Kyle.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Heather.
I know.
I brought you in.
Oh. (laughs)
(laughs)
I don't know anything about beasts.
Seeing as someone's willing to pay $5 million to capture one...
There's a bounty?
One mystery buyer puts out a bounty.
Yeah, but he was close.
He has no idea it's me.
There's got to be some way to stop it.
Damn it.
(phone ringing)
I still got time.
But you're running out of it.
You know what's at stake if you can't find JT.
Don't worry. I will find him, okay?
(panting)
Come on, Vincent. Focus.
Relax. You can do this.
(sighs) Focus.
: 
(tires screeching)
Got you.
(yelling, blows landing)
(grunts)
(yelling, blows landing)
(sighs) Took you long enough.
(yelling on game)
What do you mean?
Come on, man. I found you, didn't I?
20 minutes, city of eight million people.
(yelling, blows landing on game)
I think that's pretty good.
Ah. Still need to get back to the hospital before your break's over. Otherwise, you haven't proven a thing.
Wait. What...? I still need advice on what to tell Tess.
Hello! About my turning down tenure.
She's gonna freak.
How do I tell her without her thinking I don't want to move in with her?
Uh... honesty is the best policy.
Really?
(yelling and blows landing in game, JT sighs)
Ah! See?
Five minutes to spare. Told you I can do it.
Barely.
Barely?
Barely is better than not.
Come on, admit it.
I passed your little test, didn't I?
This proves it.
I can juggle my job, our wonderful marriage and finding whoever is after a beast, i.e., me.
Tracking JT is totally different, and you know it.
This could take weeks, months.
Catherine, I can do it.
Okay, we can do it.
I know our lives are completely out of control right now.
We barely have time to breathe, let alone...
Pay bills?
I was gonna say "make love," but that, too.
Look, the point is, we just have to manage it all, okay?
Keep our heads above water.
It-it really is no different to any other marriage.
Every other marriage doesn't have to worry about getting attacked, being exposed.
No, but they still have to juggle all the things of life, right? Careers, errands, bills, all those wonderful things.
Come on. If they can do it, we can so do it.
Okay.
Okay.
Speaking of beast bounties, Deputy Secretary Hill called, and he's got a lead, so I got to go.
Oh, God.
What? What is going on?
We still have three minutes.
Three minutes? That's not enough time.
You want to bet? (gasps)
(grunts) Mmm. Mmm.
No one touches that body until I get there.
I'm on my way. Okay.
(sighs)
(JT sighs)
Oh. Hey.
Hey.
I thought you'd be at work by now.
Why? Hoping to avoid me?
No. Why? Why would you say that?
JT, I'm kidding. Relax.
I actually have to get going anyway.
A Vic just turned up that I think could be connected to that fight club ring I've been trying to bust since, like, forever. Can you do me a favor and find our lease agreement?
Lease agreement?
Yeah, I think I packed it accidentally, and we need it before we move in to our new place.
Yeah. Uh, sure, I'll look.
(liquid pouring)
Uh, listen... can we find time to, you know, talk? You've, you know, been kind of busy lately, and we haven't had much time to... catch up.
I know. I'm sorry. There's just been a lot going on, and especially now with this new case.
I actually think I'm gonna put Cat on it.
You know, maybe we could work it together like the old days.
Teamed up pretty well with her last week.
I know, and she's probably right.
I need to get back out into the field, you know?
Anyway, I have to go.
Do you want to meet at Il Cantuccio later for drinks?
Yeah.
Okay. I'll call you.
And, hey, maybe you should call the university, see what's taking so long to find out about tenure.
Yeah. Uh, I'll do that.
Cool. Great.
(sighs deeply)
: 
First, Agent Russo's murdered, butchered.
Then they hack into our classified files, DHS is on alert. Sit.
Which means everyone's under heightened scrutiny around here, including me.
But it turned out the hack had nothing to do with Vincent.
But it could have, Detective.
Listen, Cat... Is it Cath or Catherine?
Either is fine.
I need your help.
Neither one of us can afford any more high-profile attempts at capturing your husband.
They may be after a beast, but they do not know it's Vincent yet.
But I do, and I'm covering for him.
Just like Agent Russo did, and if it's all the same to you, I don't want to get skinned alive, too.
I'm the only other one around here who knows the secret, which means I'm at risk now, too.
Which is why I'm giving you the full resources of Homeland Security-- to speed things up.
Find out who's behind this as soon as possible.
Who's this?
Eckhart Richter.
German mercenary.
Fits your profile of the type somebody might hire to find a beast.
Bounty hunter, too, just like the last attacker.
He just turned up.
Where?
Meatpacking district.
Dead, unfortunately.
You might be able to backtrack Richter to a suspect.
Uh, but I'm gonna need to get this cleared with my captain first.
No, you won't.
Sorry?
Like I said, I need you to jump on this for both our sakes.
Nobody knows I'm covering for Vincent, and nobody can.
The longer this goes on, and the messier it gets...
It's all taken care of.
You don't work at NYPD anymore.
You work for me now.
(siren wailing)
Keller?
Hey. How's it going?
What do we got?
Oh.
Don't worry. Patel's got him.
Okay.
Someone will be right with you.
So, how's Heather?
Uh, Nurse, admit patient to Trauma 5, put him on anti-coags and get him to Imaging, okay?
Do you know if she got the bouquet of flowers I sent?
Which one? You sent four.
Too much, right?
Ah.
Think I'm trying too hard?
Look, Kyle, I'm on a double shift.
I'm juggling a lot here, okay?
So, if you wouldn't mind.
I like her. I do.
I think she likes me, too, but I don't get why she's shining me on.
Come on, Doc, what's the prognosis here?
Do I have a shot at your sister-in-law, or don't I?
I don't know. Okay, there's a lot happening right now.
(phone buzzing)
I don't understand.
What do you mean?
Inbound car accident, multiple injuries.
ETA three minutes.
(overlapping chatter)
(overlapping chatter)
Uh... I'm sorry.
I... I'll talk to you later.
: All available medical personnel to the E.R.
(siren wailing)
(indistinct radio transmission)
And make sure to get a picture of his bloody knuckles, please.
Tess.
What are you doing here?
Could be another fight club Vic.
I was just about to call you.
Body just got dumped. It could be our best lead yet.
Wait. How did you find out?
Long story.
But turns out that he may be connected to the, uh... the bounty.
The... bounty? Based on what? We haven't even ID'd him yet.
Eckhart Richter, German mercenary, bounty hunter.
Bounty hunt...
How the hell do you know that?
Okay, I know this case is really important to you, so, I need you to believe me when I say that I had nothing to do with this.
Nothing to do with what? What are you talking about?
How do you know who this guy is, and I don't?
Where'd you get this?
Deputy Secretary.
I'm sorry, Tess, I hate to do this, but this isn't your case anymore.
It's mine.

Down for the Count

Original Air Date on June 16, 2016
: You could've called.
That's all I'm saying, given me a little warning instead of just springing it on me like that.
Tess, I would have.
I just didn't expect to see you on the scene.
What are you talking about?
You know I've been trying to bust that ring since before I was captain.
When you and I were partners, remember?
Of course I remember.
Really? You don't act like it, especially when you try to steal my case right from underneath me.
Okay, Tess, trust me.
I was just as surprised as you were when the deputy secretary recruited me.
I had no idea this was in the works.
No, but you love it. Admit it.
Yeah, you've been wanting to be a part of something bigger for a while now.
You and JT both.
That is not what this is about.
If this Vic, Richter, can lead us to whoever put the bounty on Vincent, that's a good thing, right, for all of us.
It means we can all go back to our normal lives.
Yeah?
Even better.
If this guy turns out to be the same one who's behind your fight club case, then the ring is broken.
Two birds, one stone.
All right, okay.
Why don't you set up shop in my office...?
I can't.
This isn't a joint investigation, Tess.
Hill wants DHS to handle it.
He wants me to handle it off-site.
Off-site? What does that mean?
It means he wants me to set up a satellite office so the rest of DHS doesn't find out that he's been protecting us.
Not only am I losing my case, I'm losing my detective?
For now.
(sighs) Great.
That's just great.
Sorry, um, but I am going to need your files, too.
: 
Hmm...
Come on, I mean, you're happy about this?
I guess. Frankly, my head's still spinning.
It's probably just temporary till we figure out who's behind the beast bounty.
It doesn't sound 
 temporary.
Otherwise, why would Hill set you up with an office?
I don't know.
Let's just take this one step at a time.
We've got enough on our plates without having to worry about this.
What? This is nothing to worry about. I think it's great.
Higher-profile cases, more resources, more action.
More work, more juggling.
More 
Come on, I mean, we could afford to hire an assistant.
We sure as hell could use one right now.
Funny you should say that.
Well, it's a two-career household, okay?
They're a little overwhelmed.
(whispers): Electric company. I hate them.
Okay. I am sending the past-due payment now, which should make them current.
Okay, thank you.
Ciao. Okay, I picked up your dry cleaning, used a coupon, but they accidentally sent Vincent's lab coats to the hospital, so I will pick those up when I drop off your rent checks.
Whew! Married life is complicated.
Meet our new assistant.
Okay.
Uh, a-are you sure you can handle all this, Heather?
I mean, it's-it's a lot.
Oh, please, did I not plan, like, three weddings last year?
Besides, I really need the job, remember?
(exhales): Okay, I am off to the hospital.
To pick up lab coats or to see Kyle?
Kyle? Kyle who?
Uh, don't worry, I know I can't risk starting a new relationship right now with somebody after you. 
Celibacy sucks.
Agreed.
Well, then the sooner we find Pierre Medjani, the better.
Who?
Someone I found on the DHS watch list that Hill gave me, and somebody I think is after you.
Why?
Because... he is an arms dealer, and you are the ultimate weapon-- a living, breathing super soldier, right?
Plus, apparently, Medjani is into blood sports-- these underground fight club rings where sometimes people fight to the death.
Oh, nice.
Who's this guy?
Eckhart Richter.
According to the M.E., he's the latest victim of those rings, and a known associate of Medjani.
So you think Medjani was gonna send this guy out to get me?
Possibly.
Could be that he wanted to see if Richter could handle you by testing him out in the ring first.
Makes sense that Medjani would want to audition somebody after the last attempt.
Okay, so find the fight club, find Medjani.
It's worth a try.
The problem is, trying to find a place to look.
The fights, they're super exclusive-- invite-only.
Maybe I could backtrack this guy where he's dumped in the alley, but the problem is, how do we find our way in?
Well, this may help.
I'm assuming that this is how Richter got in.
He was a fighter, right?
No. What, you want me to fight?
Relax. Only if necessary.
Come on, it's not like you have to worry about losing-- they're not beasts.
Oh, yeah, tell that to that guy.
Besides, I already changed my shift at the hospital once today.
I can't do it again. I got to get back as soon as possible.
I know, I know.
You're squeezed-- we both are-- but if we don't catch whoever's after you, then we have a lot more to worry about than just our jobs.
Hey there! How's it going?
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
What's wrong?
(sighs) I just wish I didn't have to find out this way, you know?
Find out about what, exactly?
About Cat.
Didn't you hear?
Cat? Uh, no. Hear what?
I-I just talked to her.
She wanted me to... pick up some files, do some research on a case she's working on.
My c... that was my case.
Now it's her case.
What are you talking about?
Cat works for DHS now.
She's a special agent.
Wait.
What? Just like that?
Just like that.
I mean, I'm happy for her.
I am. It's just... a shock, you know?
Not only am I losing my best detective, she's... she's my friend.
(sighs) I just wish she'd broken the news to me earlier, you know?
Maybe she wanted to, but d... didn't know how you'd react.
That's no excuse, that's never an excuse, you know that.
Uh, look, there's something I need to tell you.
It's fine, JT.
I'll be fine.
Life goes on, you know?
I have to get back to work.
I have to reassign all of Cat's open cases tonight, so don't wait up.
Uh... okay, but, um...
(quietly): Crap.
(exhales)
Heather?
Kyle! Hi.
You're a tough girl to get ahold of.
I know. I've been super busy.
I'm sorry. But thank you for the flowers.
I got to go.
Wait. Heather... hold up.
Are you avoiding me for some reason?
Me? No. Why?
Why? Are you kidding?
I've texted, sent flowers, cornered your brother-in-law... who, by the way, I don't think likes me very much.
Oh, please.
Who couldn't like you?
I mean...
That came out wrong.
Come on, what's the big secret?
You can tell me.
Actually, I can't.
(sighs) I'm sorry.
: Are you sure this is the right place?
: Well, from what I can tell, Medjani's man was dragged through this alleyway and thrown into a waiting car.
So if there's a fight club, it's got to be around here somewhere.
Are you okay with doing this?
Ha! 
 you're asking.
Come on, you're really worried about me fighting?
I am worried about you beasting out 
 fighting, you know?
You hit them, they hit you, your adrenaline escalates.
Come on, have a little faith in your husband, will you?
Well, hopefully, you won't have to fight at all-- we'll just find Medjani right away, and then you can... lure him out.
Right.
'Cause it's always that easy.
This is it.
Good luck.
(quietly): Yeah.

This place does not look ultra-exclusive, uh... it looks seedy.
It doesn't seem like a place you'd find Pierre Medjani.
Medjani?
He don't show till the main event.

Okay.
Not you.

I'm not trying to prove anything.
I'm trying to get our lives back, and if this is the way to do it, then so be it.
I don't mean to challenge your ability to kick ass out there, but come on, let's be real-- you're no street fighter.
Well, neither are you.
Yeah, but I'm a beast.

Well, that is one way of luring Medjani out in the open-- are you trying to get us exposed?
I don't want you to do this.
Okay, I really don't. You could get seriously hurt in there.
There's got to be some other way.
Okay, then what is it?
Exactly.
Okay, look, Vincent, number one, I've been through worse before.

Two, you saw that last fight.
You know that I could take either of them.

Maybe I'm a little worried.

No, I don't want to fight with you.
I'm just saying I sent it in.

Yes! I hit "send."
It said "payment received."

Can you hold on...?
No! No, no, no. Do not transfer me.

Does it look like Cat is here?
Gosh, JT, I changed my mind.
I never want to get married.
Not like it's ever gonna happen to me at this rate anyway.

So she wanted me to pick up some files...
Thanks.

Kyle.
(big sigh) So, when's the happy day?
Sorry?
You and Tess-- you guys are moving in together, right?
Please tell me somebody's getting laid around here.
Did I just say that?
I... got to go.
Wait.
Hold it.
Did something happen?
Did she dump you?
No, she didn't dump me.
At least not yet.
I haven't had a chance to tell her I turned down tenure yet.
So...
Really?
You turned it down?
Why?
Because being a professor for the rest of my life isn't what I want to do anymore.
That's why.
I mean, I-I thought it was, but...
So you're unemployed now.
Yeah.
Which means you can't afford your half of the new rent.
No.
And Tess doesn't know about it.
Right.
She's gonna kill you.
I know!
(bell clangs)
(groans)
: In fairness, I didn't realize this was gonna be a four-way brawl when I agreed to do this.
We can still get out of this, and I can still keep my job.
Yeah, and we lose our chance at finding Medjani.
We're here, Vincent, let's do it.
Any tips?
Yes.
Go for the kickboxer first, okay? That's your specialty.
Let the other two brawl it out, but you go for her left knee.
It's got a surgical scar on it.
That's her Achilles' heel.
Every fighter's got one, okay?
Wow, good tip.
(bell dings)
Anything else?
Yeah. Don't let them hit that pretty face of yours.
Seriously?
Yeah, seriously.
(bell dings)
Get up, honey!
Up, up, up.
Come on.
Go for the knee!
Go for the knee!
That's it, baby, that's it.
Aah!
Yeah!
Sorry.
Hey.
(bell dings)
Vincent.
Okay, yeah, she needs to get to a hospital.
No, no... no hospital.
He'll find out.
Come with me. You won.
What?
Into the van.
Final round.
You're going to see Medjani.
Hey, no, no, no!
No, she doesn't go anywhere without me.
Hey, no trainers.
Fighters only.
Vincent, it's okay, I'm fine.
You'll find me, you always do.
She needs you more right now.
(monitor beeping steadily)
Hey, what's going on?
Where am I?
It's okay, you're at the hospital.
You'll be absolutely fine.
And you-- you're a doctor?
Yes, I'm a doctor.
I'm gonna check your eyes.
Dr. Keller?
What's going on?
Someone said you brought a patient in.
Yes, I did.
Uh, she's been beat up and I found her.
Found her?
Where? How?
Look, could you please do me a huge favor-- go get me 20 milligrams of morphine.
Okay?
It's fine. I will explain later.
Please.
Okay.
I'm sorry about that.
Okay.
Up you go.
Yeah, easy.
Easy. I got to get you stabilized so I can go back out and find my wife.
Your wife?
Um, I can't be here.
I got to fight.
Listen, you.
You're not doing any more fighting for today, okay?
Just relax.
You're lucky to be alive.
You think Medjani gives a damn?
All he cares about is winning.
You know him?
You know Medjani?
Yeah, unfortunately.
How do you know him?
He gave me my first big break as a fighter and he helped get my family out of debt.
But I didn't realize that that meant he owns me.
But he does.
And he always expects me to win.
Because... he always bets on me.
He doesn't like to lose.
What happens if you don't win?
I'm dead.
Like I said, he doesn't like to lose.
He won't let your wife lose.
And once he has her...
Listen to me.
You help me find Medjani-- you help me find my wife-- and I promise you, you will never have to worry about that guy again.
First round takes place at some club that Medjani frequents.
Upper East Side somewhere.
I-I don't know, JT, maybe, uh, check Catherine's DHS files, okay? See if anything pops up, all right?
And keep trying to track down that van that took her, too, okay?
I'm gonna do the same.
(knocking)
Hey.
Hey. Where you been?
Oh, I, uh, decided to stay at my place last night.
Yeah, I figured.
Yeah, I did have a, uh, nice, long chat with our future landlord, though.
Right. Listen, uh, could we talk about that later?
I'm trying to track this van.
So you turned down your tenure, huh?
Oh, how'd I find out?
Well, it wasn't from my boyfriend, which is, of course, how you'd expect me to find out.
Tess...
No, no, no, no.
I had to find out from the landlord who called the university to verify your employment and then called me.
I wanted to tell you.
I did, but I just...
I didn't know how to, and I-I knew you'd think it meant...
What, that you don't want to move in with me? It does.
No, it doesn't mean that at all.
Then how come you're still packing five weeks later, huh?
All right? You don't even have that much stuff.
Then you quit your job, you change your mind about your entire life without including me?
What am I supposed to think?
I... Look, I-I'm an idiot.
I am. And-and you have every right to be pissed, but honestly, right now I need to help Vincent find Cat.
Find Cat?
What happened?
: JT?
You find that van yet?
Uh, no.
I lost it at 58th and Park. You couldn't track it?
If I could, would I be here?
Oh, I'm sorry, man, that was a jerk of a thing to say. I'm just-- I'm panicked, you know, I shouldn't have left Catherine just to take that other fighter to the hospital.
What the hell was I thinking?
Whoa, whoa, wait-- fighter? Does this have to do with my fight club case?
Yeah. Look, we may have found a lead on whoever put up the bounty. Some-some guy called Medjani.
Pierre Medjani?
You know him?
Yeah.
Are my files here?
Yeah.
Pierre Medjani was my key suspect behind the ring, but I didn't have enough to bust him at the time, but I was...
I was working on it. Here.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
Because the case was taken away from me, remember?
This is what happens when people stop communicating.
Here, Alighieri House.
This is the name of Medjani's club.
It's on 69th between Fifth and Madison.
Yeah, it looks like a condo from the outside, but that's just a cover.
Mm!
I love you!
At least somebody loves me.
I love you.
(groans)
(indistinct chatter)
: Let's go.
How's it going?
: That's him, that's Pierre Medjani.
(applause)
: Pierre Medjani.
Good evening, Mr. Medjani.
: Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention, please.
The main event is about to begin.
Winner take all.

(grunting)
(grunting)
: 
Does that mean I have it?
Oh, great, thanks.
All right, judge approved the warrant, tac team is scrambling.
ETA ten minutes.
Ten minutes? What... Catherine might not have ten minutes.
Hey, turn on 61st.
(chimes)
That's me. Can you check it?
Is it Catherine?
No, it's New York General.
Apparently you missed your shift.
Ah, what else is new?
I thought this would get easier, Tess.
I thought when Catherine and I got married, you know, we'd move on to the next chapter of our lives...
Will you gun it, please?
Come on!
(grunting)
No.
(grunts) Enough.
(crowd, whistling, cheering)
Wait.
NYPD!
Nobody move, you're under arrest.
Everybody freeze!
: Hey, everybody remain where you are.
Vincent?
He's here.
Freeze. DHS.
You're DHS?
You set me up?
Yeah. And you're under arrest for, among other things, putting a bounty out on my husband.
Bounty? What bounty?
What are you talking about?
Kill her.
(screams)
(screams)
What the hell was that?
I think you know.
(low growling)
What the hell?
What are you?
What's happening?
Please, please, please, don't-don't kill me, I beg you. I'm sorry.
Whatever I've done...
I don't, I don't... please, I'm sorry.
Or maybe he doesn't know.
(indistinct chatter)
Hey, for the record, Cat didn't need rescuing.
She kicked ass.
Uh, for the record, I wasn't worried, Tess.
Mm-hmm. Still, Vincent, SWAT almost saw you, and, worse, Medjani did.
Eh, who's gonna believe him?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey.
You mind if we have a minute?
It's okay.
I'm a... I'm a doctor.
And her husband.
At least, I hope I still am.
Okay. All yours.
Thank you.
For better or worse, right?
Oh, gosh.
Ow.
Yeah, that is gonna need stitches. I thought I told you not to let anyone hit that pretty little face of yours. Oh.
I'm sorry, I was too busy trying to stay alive.
Oh, yeah, that.
Huh.
Look, I'm so sorry. I tried to get here as fast as I could.
It's okay, really.
I'm the one who volunteered for this, remember?
Yeah, but only 'cause you thought by taking down Medjani that we'd get our lives back, right?
Yeah. Try again.
Yeah.
Eh, come on.
It's not all that bad.
We took down Tess' undercover fight club, and you got one of DHS's most wanted.
That's pretty good for your first day on the job, Special Agent.
Yeah, and you saved that fighter's life.
But that doesn't solve any of 
 problems.
No.
(phone chimes)
(clears throat)
Let me guess, the hospital?
Damn it. I-I really got to go.
I'll send the paramedic back in, okay?
Sure. He's cute.
And you're married.
Ow!
(chuckles softly)
Come in.
Hey.
Since when do you knock?
Since, uh...
Oh, right.
Since you became a fed.
Sounds really weird.
Yeah, that's 'cause feds are usually the enemy.
They tend to, uh, exercise their jurisdictional authority whenever the hell they feel like it, remember?
Bad time.
No, no.
Whatever.
I'm not mad anymore.
Doesn't mean I like it.
I was hoping we'd get to work together on cases, you know, like we used to.
We still can, Tess, just in a different way.
Seriously.
Vincent told me that you were the one that found me, because you were on Medjani's trail the entire time and DHS wasn't.
Imagine, we could just share resources, work together on a bunch of cases.
It could be great.
(exhales)
(sniffles)
You sure DHS is really what you want?
For now, yeah. You know, at least until we figure out who's behind this beast bounty.
And then... and then we'll see.
I don't know.
Something tells me this is gonna stick.
And I can totally see it. (chuckles)
Ten years, we've been working together, Cat.
I'm... I'm really gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you. (sniffles)
Well, at least you don't have to cover for me anymore.
(both chuckle)
: 
Thank you.
I'll take a glass, too, please.
Kyle? What-what are you doing here?
I'm not giving up.
That's what I'm doing here.
Kyle, listen...
I like you, Heather.
A lot.
Look, if you want to pretend that we never slept together, that's fine.
Kyle.
But we did sleep together.
It was fantastic.
It was the kind of fantastic that says it was a hell of a lot more than just a one-night stand.
For both of us.
So you've got family secrets.
Big deal. Who doesn't?
You have no idea.
I don't care.
I don't.
And I don't care how hard your brother-in-law tries to push me away either.
'Cause I'm not giving up unless you tell me to.
Right here, right now.
(sighs) Look at me, Heather.
Just tell me you don't ever want to see me again, and I'll walk away.
I promise.
But if you can't do that...
I'm not going anywhere.
Just... don't ask too many questions, okay?
Like what?
(scoffs)
I won't.
What are you doing?
Hi.
I didn't hear you come in.
You all right?
(sighs) No, I'm not all right.
My best detective and partner just quit on me, and my... boyfriend lied to me.
Whoa. I didn't exactly lie to you.
No, you did, though.
Every time we saw each other and you didn't tell me you turned down tenure, that's... that's no different than a lie.
Lucky for you, I'm just too tired to be mad right now.
(chuckles) Lucky me.
Uh, don't press your luck.
Hey.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
I... (stammers) I should have, regardless of how I thought you'd react.
But I don't want you to think that my turning down tenure has anything to do with wanting to move in with you.
But it does, JT. It has everything to do with it.
Don't you see that?
You realized you don't want to be a professor for the rest of your life, right?
You made a decision, a gutsy one, even though you have no idea what you want to do now, right?
Well, yeah, I guess.
But see, I, I do know what I want.
I'm not confused.
I'm not searching like you are.
And yes, the-the past couple of years have been really, really crazy and I fought really, really hard to get my life back...
...personally, professionally.
But I know what I want.
And what I want is to move in with you.
Now I'm ready, but you're not.
Not anymore.
Otherwise, you would've finished packing a long time ago.
And you know it.
Just be honest.
But I love you.
I love you, too.
We would be so stupid to take the next step without you finding what... whatever the hell it is you're looking for.
So, where do we go from here?
I don't know.
Honey?
(groans)
Aw, baby, how was your day?
(sighs) Oh, you know, same old, same old.
Oh, by the way, our electricity got cut off and our rent check bounced.
I thought Heather was...
Yeah, yeah, I know. I fired her already.
She sounded relieved actually.
Said our lives were out of control and too hard to manage.
That we already know.
So, got any ideas what we're gonna do about it?
Nope, not a one.
Great. (groans)
Oh, I'm sorry. Where does it hurt?
You mean where doesn't it hurt?
Uh-huh.
I admit, you know, I really like kicking ass.
I do not like having my ass kicked.
Ditto.
Uh-huh.
What are we gonna do?
I mean, we're no closer to finding whoever's put up this bounty than when we first got back from our honeymoon.
Okay, so maybe we haven't passed all the tests yet.
But we will figure out a way, Vincent.
We always do.
Although I'm starting to doubt if there really is a beast bounty.
I mean, we keep looking.
We keep bringing in bad guys, but nobody's attacked since.
What if that bounty hunter was lying?
What if he was working alone?
Maybe.
But on the other hand, if he wasn't lying, and we let our guard down...
Yeah, then we're screwed.
I know.
Yeah.
In that case, there's only one thing left to do.
Yeah, and what's that?
Oh.
(laughs)
I like it.
Uh-huh.
Ow!
Oh, sorry.
No hands.
No hands.
