This is 97.2 Heat FM and we have Franky Doyle in the house.
Whoo!
Ex reality TV star, former prisoner, now the low-down is you were the big dog!
Ah, the phrase is "Top Dog".
Top dog, big dog, you were the baddest bitch in there.
I'm definitely getting that vibe now.
Well there were badder bitches than me, and not all of them were on my side of the bars.

Now you tipped a wok full of hot oil on that reality chef, Noel Saga.
I hear they call him Scarface now.
I'm not here to talk about that.
I thought we were here to talk about surviving on the inside.
OK. If I ever go down, what tips would you give me?
Well, it's all about power.
Whose got it and who wants it.
If you got it, what do you do to keep it?
What parts of yourself will you shut down to stay on top?
And if you want it, what are you gonna do to get it?
We are all strong women and we certainly don't need Bea Smith to tell us what to do and when to do it, do we?
(Laughter)
If you had to, would you be willing to kill someone?
Here we are girls.
Home sweet f*ckin' home.
Whooo...
They're here, Governor.
What a pity that this pristine environment is about to be spoiled, by prisoners.
I believe a thing is enhanced, Mr Channing, when it gets to serve its true purpose.
Well we'll know in a couple of days whether that's true.
Well ideally I need two weeks to settle the returning prisoners back in.
The board views the rebuild as a clean slate, Vera.
In two days this place will be crawling with press and VIPs, and after the recent fiasco we need a good news story, hmm?
Don't f*ck it up.

But they could have changed the colour.
Yeah, made the cells a tad roomier and stuck in an en-suite and a jacuzzi and...
f*ckin' hell.
Look at this, they look like f*ckin' Barbie dolls.
I mean, where are the arse cracks?
Oh God. Don't worry about the arse cracks.
Look at all the new programs: we've got book club, yoga, art therapy, fitness and nutrition.
What about a choir?
Nah, that's a sh1t idea, Liz.
My vote's for conjugal visits like they have at Walford.
Now that is a bloody brilliant idea, Dor, that's a brilliant idea, hey, yeah!
Hey, Bea? Bea, we want conjugals, eh.
Yeah, well who am I gonna conjugate?
Just conjugate yourself.
Hey.
Welcome back, Bea.
Good to see you, Bea.

No.

Say hello to Daddy.
G'day, Dad.
G'day, yeah it's Josh here.
I'm so excited mate about getting out in a couple of days to see you.
Hey, I'm gonna pack my bag and put my toys in there, and steal some of Boomer's chocolates.
(Laughs)
Right, I'm gonna sign up for fitness goals and nutrition.
Nah, I'll bet you it's full.

Yeah, cause everyone would have heard about the conjugals and wanted to get fit, eh?
Yeah. Now I'll have to do yoga or creating your CV.

Governor.
Take a seat.
It's prisoner's art therapy.
(Scoffs)
Have they recovered?
So how are you settling in?
I trust you're comfortable?
Yeah. Better than the Ritz.
Look, I am going to be a tough, but fair governor, and progressive one.
I have worked bloody hard for the last few months.
I've set up great programs, and initiatives for the women and I will see them through.
But I need you to come with me.
You need me?
We both have similar ambitions for the women.
The new Wentworth.
In two days the new parts of the building will be officially opened, there'll be some attention from the media.
What? So this is just to impress the press?
And that's just fluff.
Hmmm?
But those programs are not a public relations exercise, they are about genuine rehabilitation.
Oh... clearly working for Kim Chang. (Scoffs)
That's exactly my point.
Drugs have always found their way in.
But you are the only leader who has never trafficked them. In fact, you kept the flow right down. The women need you.
What if I can't be stuffed?
Well...
Well that would be a shame because... there are a lot of young girls at risk from drugs in this prison.
Now, I know you don't want to see them end up like Kim.
OK.
Thank you.
But the women want conjugal visits.
Oh, oh really?
Conjugal visits?
Yeah.
Well, if it's good enough for the blokes at Walford...
Well you've just finished telling me how progressive you are.
All right. In the spirit of cooperation, I will canvas that with the board if I have an assurance from you that we can work together and there will be no trouble in front of the press.
If there's any trouble, won't come from me.
What took you?
The old Governor was on for a chat.
It's time for the changeover.
Yeah?
Come on...
What?
Kaz...
So it's started already?
It's not like any of us actually...
Not now, Liz!
Welcome home, Bea.
(chuckles)

It's not for you, mate!
Now I was pissed off with you.
I thought you had betrayed everything we stood for.
But I've come to understand how dehumanising this place can be and you're as much a victim of it as any of us.
I've told you before Kaz, I'm no victim.
Neither am I. f*ck being a victim.
I wanna be your friend, Bea.
Even though you shopped me to the cops.

Last night...
Joan Ferguson was transferred here on remand from Sinclair.
You're joking?
I realise it is not an ideal situation for a whole host of reasons.
Nevertheless, she's here until her trial in the new protected isolation unit.
She is to have no interaction with other prisoners and minimal contact with staff.
It goes without saying I want this kept under wraps, so if anyone has anything to say about this matter, now is the time to raise it.
OK.
Nurse Radcliffe, the contraceptive program, you are to stress its voluntary nature to the women.
Yeah I can do that.
Good.
And that's it. Um... Let's not forget tomorrow, VIP event. Make sure you're all prepared for it.
I want us to present Wentworth's very best face. Thank you.
(whispered chatter)
It's your fault you know? Ferguson being here.
How's that?
You should have let her burn.
What's goin' on?
The contraceptive education program starts today. It's voluntary.
What is this Nurse Radcliffe, you want to put us on the pill?
The program is to educate women about unwanted pregnancies on release.
What do I need the pill for?
You?
Feel like I'm at a party I shouldn't have been invited to.
You can't force us on the pill.
It's voluntary.
They can't force us.
It's vo-lun-ta-ry.
What are you trying to pull here?
I'm just the messenger.
If you stop carrying on, I'll explain the program to you.
What's to explain?
This is chemical control. This is what this is.
All right, all right, all right, all right, eh? Everyone calm down please.
What's the problem ladies?
We control our own bodies. Not you.
The program is voluntary, Proctor.
That's what I've been telling her.
PMS relief, what bullshit!
Well you can choose not to participate.
And that's what we're doing. All of us.
Come on girls, let's go.
Hold on!
That's not really your choice to make, is it Kaz?
I'm sure all the women here can make up their own minds.
Yeah?
Why are you so keen to get us on the pill Mr Jackson?
Is there a prisoner here you'd like to f*ck and not get pregnant?
Yeah!
Watch it, Proctor.
Prisoner Ferguson.
Is there anything you need?
Pencil... I want to write a letter.
You can't be trusted with pencils.
I didn't want you here. I petitioned corrections to have you remanded interstate. Your lawyer fought the petition. Why?
I wanted to see what it looks like.
The prison?
That little gold crown on your shoulder. Makes you look... taller. What does feel like, Vera, to finally have everything you've ever wanted?
It's Governor.
(scoffs)
You'll be housed in this unit until your trial.
After sentencing you'll be moved to another facility. I'll see to that.
You know I'm innocent. I was set up. I saved a child's life. I'm a hero.
Good luck convincing a jury.
I will be exonerated. And when I am, I will be demanding a full reinstatement. I'll be coming for that shiny little crown.
Oh, I think Mr Channing might have something to say about that.
How is Derek?
He must be like a pig in mud having a governor he can control.
You've always been so easily managed.
It's time for the prisoner's medication, Governor.
