That is what we thought last year.
So, what, you think if we just stay cooped up in the hotel room, we'll be safe?
Maybe?
Okay, no, obviously.
I know that DHS covered our tracks, your tracks, but let's face it, sooner or later, something is bound to happen.
I think that the least likely scenario is that you are never going to have to beast out again.
I will if they screw up our room service again.
Okay, look... yes, you're right.
Fine.
Someday, somebody is probably going to try and attack me again, or expose me, or us.
But who cares?

No, but they're going to unless we do something to stop it.
What?
The blogosphere found out about beasts.
The blogosphere.
Yeah.
And apparently it's mushrooming, too.
All because of one blogger in particular, Peter Duncan, and he's got Web cred.
Come here. Are you out of your mind?
What?
Hey. Break's over.
Please.
Sorry, Cap.
It has been two months since DHS has covered all things beast, which means that's two months I haven't had to worry about losing my job. Do you understand?
I know, but we can't ignore this, it's big.
It's a blogger.
Not just any blogger, a celebrity blogger, and one who claims to have proof.
Look, what if he's picked up on all the exposure threats from last year and somehow pieced it together?
I already told you, Homeland Security covered all those tracks.
Mainstream tracks, maybe, but not digital tracks, the kind that techies, bloggers and geeks like me pick up on.
And if that's what this guy Duncan's done, then Vincent could get exposed.
Look, JT, we're... we're moving in together.
We found a great place, a steal.
I know, but...
You're back to teaching, I'm back to running the precinct... we're back to normal.
We've gotta get out of the habit of looking for trouble all the time.
Otherwise, we can never move forward.
Look, I gotta get back to work and you've gotta get back to packing.

You did crisis management in PR, right?
Well, that is PR.
Wait, why?
This blogger is making waves, beast waves, and we got to stop him before tomorrow.
Why? What happens tomorrow?
I don't know, but he's gonna make some big announcement, possibly expose Vincent.
I mean, this Duncan guy is legit, he's been investigating all the exposure threats DHS covered up-- cold cases, maulings, vigilante stuff.
And since his blog is starting to gain traction with the fringe crowd, we've got to stop him before it goes wide.
Okay.
I mean, why not?
It's been a little slow since the last big showdown and all.
So, yeah, I'm game.
Okay.
So what do we do, how do we stop this?
We have to discredit him somehow, make people lose faith in him.
How? He's not making any of this stuff up.
I know, but we have to make his fan base think that he is Okay, so hack into his computer, corrupt his files?
No, that'll just only confirm that somebody's trying to stop him and fan the conspiracy flames.
We have to control the messaging somehow.
I know.
We have to get to his computer and send out the disinformation from there to make it look legit.
Fine, but how?
Well, uh... like, maybe a little breaking and entering?
But we've done so much worse.

What do you want me to do, nothing?
No, of course not, that's not the point.
Okay, then what is the point?
Really? We're gonna have our first fight as a married couple on our honeymoon?
Sorry.
That's just our new reality, that's all.
We're so used to worrying about being exposed by somebody who's after you, but this, this is different.
This is our future.
Even doing the right thing is a threat.
There are cameras everywhere.
Come on, what choice do we have?
Neither one of us is the kind of person not to get involved.
And that is not about to change just because we got married, right?
Yeah, I don't want to change it, I don't.
But you have to admit that the consequences of being exposed are pretty huge.
We have never got caught, have we?
No, but...
No, and we are not about to either.
You want to know why?
Hmm?
Tell me.
Because... we have gone through so much just to get to this point.
That we've overcome so many obstacles, more than any other couple could possibly... ever handle-- that's why... we have made it.
(chuckles)
We got nothing to worry about.

Mm.

No. Sorry, it's not.

Let me guess-- honeymoon's over.

Are you hurt?
No, I... I don't think so.
And Heather's gonna be okay, too.
Thank God.
(chuckles): Yeah. No kidding.
(thump)
Ow.
What the hell were you thinking?
I can explain.
No, you can't, JT.
Forget the fact that you're guilty of breaking and entering.
Which, by the way, makes you a possible murder suspect.
You could have gotten yourself killed.
Heather, too.
You think we expected to find a killer inside?
And not just any killer, but an assassin.
You should have seen what he did to the blogger.
Which, by the way, proves I was right.
About what?
About what Duncan knew, or at least thought he knew, about... beasts.
Why else would the killer have taken his hard drive 
 killed him?
Bloggers piss people off all the time.
You don't know it was because of... the “B” word.
That's what detectives are for, not professors.
And this is so not us moving forward, JT, this is us moving backwards.

Did you see who killed that guy?
Oh, um... you know...
: Hey.
Police business. Out.
Just so we're clear, Cat would kill you for this, you know that, right?
Yeah.
(sighs): Look... maybe the blogger did know about beasts, which means the killer does now, too.
All right, now we're talking.
: Or not. Either way, it's a police investigation, do you understand me?
A murder-- which means, you stay out of it, both of you.
And keep Cat and Vincent out of it, too.
(sighs)
What?
Um, I already sort of called them.
: In Paris on their honeymoon?
Heather got hurt-- what was I supposed to do, not tell them?
They're already on their way back.
I don't get it-- it's almost like you guys miss all this craziness. Do you?
(chuckles): No. Of course not.
Of course not.
All right, look, go to the airport, turn Cat and Vincent around.
What?!
Yeah?
To France?
How? They're not gonna want to go back.
Make them. Tell them you overreacted, jumped the gun.
Tell them Heather's fine. Just do whatever you have to do to keep them out of here until we know exactly what's going on.

Hey! Welcome back. Bonjour!
What, you got a cab waiting for us or something?
A cab? No, uh, listen, I-I think there's been some sort of mix-up.
What do you mean?
Okay, can we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Yeah.
Actually, no. Uh, we don't really need to go to the hospital. Heather's fine.
She's been released. She's... on her way home.
Home?
I mean, you know, to your place.
She's house-sitting, right?
Okay, wait-wait-wait. Uh, I'm confused.

 three stories.
More like two and a half.
Couple of bruises, that's it.
O-Okay, and what about this blogger?
You said he-he knows something about me?
Possibly but maybe not.
I might have jumped the gun a little.
I apologize-- I-I shouldn't have called and ruined your honeymoon, but... hey, there's another flight to Paris in a couple hours, so, 
Wait!
Tess is pissed that you called us, isn't she?
No.
Yes.
But Heather really is okay.
I promise.
And... Tess is right-- I shouldn't have dragged her into this, I shouldn't have put her in harm's way.
Come on, man, you shouldn't put yourself into harm's way.
What the hell are you thinking?
I don't know. I mean, I really thought this blogger was maybe gonna expose you, and then he got killed, then I don't know what's going on.
Maybe Tess is right-- maybe I'm just used to getting into trouble.
Okay, look, on the bright side, if it does turn out to be something, it'll be a good thing you called, right?
(groans): Aw, Tess is gonna kill me.
I will take care of Tess. You track the killer, see if you can figure out why he wanted to kill the blogger so badly.
Love you.
Love you. Mwah!
Uh, b-but what, what are you gonna tell Tess?
Come on!
(siren wails, chirps)
: What do you mean he was tortured? How?
Who would do something like that?
Don't be mad at JT.
We wouldn't leave.
No, it's probably a good thing.
All right, send me the M.E.'s report, along with whatever else was on the blogger's cloud.
I need to know what the killer has and what his next move is.
What's going on?
Oh, you know, just people getting skinned alive, um, cover-ups, beast hunters-- I'm screwed.
“Beast hunters”?
Door.
Do you remember how close Liam came to exposing Vincent last year?
You know, dredging up beastly cold cases?
Yeah, but Agent Russo had DHS cover that up for us.
Apparently some conspiracy theory blogger stayed on the case and was going to offer up proof of beasts this afternoon.
But somebody killed him first?
Yeah, after torturing him for information.
JT and Heather were lucky they got out of there alive, because whoever this killer is, he's badass.
So, JT was right.
Yes, yes. Unfortunately.
Oh, Cat, geez.
Really, I really, I thought we were past all this.
I thought it was over.
Believe me, you're not the only one surprised that we're back.
How do we ever move on?
How do we get back to our normal lives if we're constantly playing whack-a-beast all the time?
I don't know, but we can't stop trying.
Somehow, some way, there's a way out of this, I know it. We just have to find it.
I thought I did.
I thought JT and I did, you know?
We're supposed to move in together like normal people do.
Look, we just have to take this one step at a time.
If we can find this killer, hopefully we can put an end to it before anybody else starts looking for beasts.
Amen.
Your lips, God's ears.
(phone rings)
Yeah.
Wait, are you sure?
All right, thanks.
What is it?
I.T. says that the blogger discovered somebody at DHS squashed the cold cases, which you and I know link to Vincent, so it means that the killer knows about...
Agent Russo.
We have to warn him.
: Freeze!
: Hands up!
Turn around.
Stop, don't move. Stop!
So... how was the honeymoon?
Excuse me.
Is that Agent Russo?
Tortured, too, just like the blogger.
How the killer got past security and surveillance, I have no clue.
He's obviously a pro.
Wait, what are you guys even doing here, how'd you find out?
Uh, Vincent beast-tracked the killer from the blogger's apartment.
(whispers): Really?
Sorry.
Okay, look, obviously he's following the blogger's trail. The question is, why is he torturing and killing people just to try and find...
You?
Well, I don't think he knows it's me yet.
Otherwise why would he come looking here?
Still, he's getting close.
Real close.
Deputy secretary's getting nervous.
Can you blame him? With Russo gone, he's the only other agent who knows about this.
Yeah, you think maybe he's starting to regret covering for us?
No, he just wants us to keep it quiet, especially from the rest of DHS.
He went out on a limb to protect us, he doesn't want it to bite him in the ass either.
Yeah, well, then we'd better find the killer before the other agents do.
And before the blogosphere finds out.
Duncan getting killed was big news, which only made the conspiracy theorists that much more convinced that somebody's hiding the truth.
Exposure concerns all around.
Yeah, well, I'm more worried about you right now. Now that he knows that you're involved.
He's probably gonna come looking for you next to try and ID me.
At our apartment.

I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.

Well, that was awkward.
Heath, we thought you were in trouble.
Trouble, why?
Because we knew you were staying here, and someone's probably after Catherine.
So what else is new?
What? It's always either one of you two.
Or JT, or me.
How long have you known Karl?

And, you know, a while.
Okay, fine. Like a day.
A day?
I don't need your sisterly judgment right now, okay?
I'm a grown woman.
Who tends to fall for guys too fast.
I'm sorry.
It's just, I don't think that now is the best time to start seeing somebody.
Why not?
Because somebody might be trying to expose me.
Again, what else is new?
You're serious?
For right now, yeah.
I just think it's too dangerous for you, Heath, and for, uh... Karl.
Kyle.
It's Kyle.
And maybe you should find a new place to live, at least until everything, you know, blows over.
Really? And when will that be-- in, like, 50 years?
(door opens, closes)
If we're lucky, 50 years.
Oh, come on.
No.
No, she's right, we should be realistic about this.
Who's to say this will not continue happening forever?
Hey, hey, we will find a way out, okay?
Yeah, how?
I-I don't know, but we will, okay? We haven't come this far not to get our happily ever after back.
Unless, of course, you want a divorce.

I get the juicer.

Agent Russo told me.
People will say anything when they're being tortured.

Okay, look, I don't have any idea what Agent Russo was investigating.
I was just there investigating a murder.
I don't know anything about... beasts.
I don't... I don't believe in that crap.
I think you do, and I think you know who it is.
And seeing as someone's willing to pay $5 million to capture one, I think I should know who it is.
$5 million? There's a bounty?
A credible one, as well.
Otherwise I wouldn't have gone to all this trouble to track him down.
Who's putting up the money?
How does he even know it exists?
I don't know and I don't care.
He obviously does.
Actually, you rarely get to know the buyers in my line of work.
Human targets, exotic animals-- all the same to me.
But the people who pay me, they prefer to remain anonymous.
For obvious reasons.

Okay.
Okay, which pier?
Either Pier 89 or 90.
Damn it, which one is it?
I don't know. He could be walking to either one.
Fish and Wildlife busted a smuggling ring at Pier 89 five years ago. I'm on my way.
It's 89.
Okay, I'll be there.
I know you're repulsed by what I do, but it's a craft like anything else. If there wasn't a market for this kind of thing, I wouldn't do it.

Are you kidding?
You affect dozens of college students, hundreds.
That makes a huge difference.
I know, but...
Look, I want normal as much as anybody, but I've been a part of something not normal for years, ever since my best friend became a beast.
Do I miss it? No.
But did it form me, change me?
Yeah, it did.
So, I don't... I don't understand. What does that mean?
I mean...
I don't know what I mean.
But I do know that I can't deny that it's part of who I am now, the need to make a bigger difference, the very thing you convinced me of last year.
I want to find that.
I need that in my life.
And I need you to support that.
Okay.
As long as you don't get yourself killed in the process.

What is this?
Bordeaux and the rest of our honeymoon.
(chuckles) Please, take a seat.
Wow. This looks amazing. What is it?
Yeah. Uh, well, let me tell you.
(grunts) Voila.
Uh, v-vich...
Vichyssoise.
With sour cream and chives, uh, endive with candied pecans, and aubergine Pro-ven-cal.
(laughs) I think it's “Provençal.”
Oui.
Yes.
I wanted to go vegetarian after everything that happened, you know?
That's good thinkin'.
Please.
Oh.
Ah. To us.
To us.
Are you a little worried you're so exposed up here?
Uh, no.
No, I think we caught the bounty hunter, we're good.
Come on. Where there's one, there are more.
It's only a matter of time before somebody picks up on the trail.
$5 million is a lot of money.
Yeah, well, actually, I was a little disappointed.
I think I'm worth more than that.
Vincent, I am being serious.
Come on.
One mystery buyer puts out a bounty on a beast.
He has no idea it's me.
I mean, the-the poacher didn't even know it was me, right?
Yeah, but he was close.
And who's to say that you aren't the last beast standing?
Uh, exactly.
All the more reason why I should be worth a hell of a lot more.
(sighs)
Watch those worry lines.
Okay. You're not worried, I'm not worried.
Great. Fantastic.
Fine.
Still...
No, please.
Seriously, Vincent, you're not worried?
No.
All right, honestly, maybe a little.
But there's only so much worrying one can do, right?
I mean, there's Muirfield, Gabe, Liam, and now bounty hunters.
There's always gonna be something.
Still, there's got to be a way to stop it somehow.
So we can live like a normal married couple, without worrying about being exposed, too.
Okay, yes, but until that happens, this is who we are, my dear wife, for better, for worse.
