Editor: 
Previously on "The Flash"...
Welcome to Earth-2.
I met your doppelganger. She's a cold-hearted ice queen named Killer Frost.
The name is Vibe.
Reverb.
My brothers and sisters, I've brought us to this new world, ours for the taking!
[shouting] Whose world is this?
[all chanting] Our world! Our world!
Our world, our world!
[gunfire and zapping]
[dramatic music]
Reloading!
Ah! [groans]
David!
[groaning]
Back door! Captain's down.
Go, go, go, go, go!
[thudding]
[tires screech]
Down, down! Down, get down!
[whooshing]
[gunfire, screaming stops]
Some people are calling it the metapocalypse, the days when Central City was overrun by an army with powers beyond imagination.
But in these dark times, we must never forget our own strength, our own power to fight back.
[keys clatter]
That it is only in the blackest of nights that we can truly see the light... and know for sure we are not alone.
We are never... ever... alone.
We usually take these guys down one at a time, not 100 at a time.
And yet, you don't seem overwhelmed.
I know we can do it.
Guys. You have to come see this.
Cisco, what are you...
Caitlin?
[sighs] She's in shock.
A little... dehydrated and malnourished, but I think she'll be fine.
I'm okay.
What happened? How did you get away?
He... let me go.
I didn't think he would; I thought it was a trap.
But... he told me you were dead.
I'm not. I'm right here.
We're all here, together.
Snow.
Jay's not here.
You're safe.
He's gonna overrun the city. You can't stop him.
Yes, we can.
Listen to me, he's not going to succeed.
We've got this. This is our Earth.
You don't know that.
You don't know what he is capable of.
I know from being in the Speed Force that the universe is with us, not Zoom.
And if the universe is with us, how could we possibly lose?
Right, guys?
Yeah, yeah, right.
You've been through a lot.
You should get some rest, come on.
You were in the Speed Force?
I... when you were gone.
It's hard to explain, but we tried to get my powers back and when the dark matter lightning...
Okay, I'm gonna say it.
Um, we don't think he's being just a little too...
Overconfident?
Yeah, maybe it was his time in the Speed Force.
I mean, he's acting like he's invincible now or something.
Yeah, like nothing fazes him anymore, which isn't...
Realistic, no.
Somebody needs to talk to him before letting his guard down gets him hurt or worse.
He did bring me out of my coma.
That's bound to make someone a little overly chipper.
Well, like I said, somebody needs to talk to him.
Amazing job, Anupam.
This is exactly the kind of groundbreaking thinking I built this company for.
Well done.
[foreboding music]
[sonic wail]
[dramatic music pounds]
[overlapping chatter]
Everyone, evacuate! Now!
[women screaming]
Hurry!
[screaming, objects crashing]
Hey.
She's out like a light, huh?
Yeah.
Jay really did a number on her.
It's not like he exactly used kid gloves on the rest of us.
She'll be okay. She just needs time.
And for us to finally bring Zoom down.
Which we will.
Yeah, because the universe is with us, right?
Listen, man...
[dramatic music pounds]
[birds chirping]
[eerie music]
Cisco?
Hey. You okay?
You just vibe?
Yeah.
What'd you see?
I saw a bird.
Like, a dead bird.
[alert beeping]
Mercury Labs.
It's under attack.
All right.
[people shouting]
[boom]
Thank you, Mr. Allen.
I'm not stupid.
[small laugh]
Boom.
So how did you know?
Your real identity?
Yeah.
Come on, Barry, I'm a scientist.
We're paid to be perceptive.
And you're always a little too well informed when things go pear-shaped in this city.
But I don't believe we've ever met before.
Dr. Christina McGee.
Doctor Henry Allen.
I'm Barry's father.
Okay, now that the cat's out of the bag, did you happen to see who it was that cause your building to collapse?
I didn't see anything. It happened so fast.
Maybe the security cameras caught something?
Can we access them?
Mercury Labs does have a Crash-Survivable Memory Unit.
A what?
Virtually a black box for buildings.
It will have stored all the security footage right up until the building collapsed.
Okay, great, I'll go find it.
This wasn't some random meta-human.
Whenever Mercury Labs has been targeted in the past there's always been a specific reason.
Yeah, someone's after something.
Yes, and that someone is probably Zoom.
There may be one more possibility.
A few months ago, I saw Harrison Wells running out of my facility.
I know it sounds crazy, but I'm certain it was him.
Is there any way he could have anything to do with this?
A few months ago?
Sure.
Now?
No.
Yeah, there are a few more things that we could catch you up on, Dr. McGee.
Hey, my purse!
[engine revs]
That ain't yours, punk.
Big mistake.
You picked a bad time to play hero.
[dramatic music builds]
[groaning]
Dad?
Wally.
What the hell were you doing?
That guy just jacked a bunch of people so I had to go after him.
You could have got yourself killed!
I'm not just gonna let these guys get away with this.
I have to do something.
Wally, these are not just guys!
These are meta-humans!
Leaves this to the cops and The Flash.
The Flash can't be everywhere at once.
I... I have to do what I can to help.
I have to show him I was worth being saved.
Wally...
You are... worth it.
Really?
Am I?
'Cause last time I checked, I'm the guy who avoided his dying mother for weeks.
I'm the guy who shamed a bunch of other guys and illegally took their cars from them.
I'm the guy who caused The Flash to lose his powers and start this whole damn "metapocalypse" in the first place.
Wally...
Last time I checked, I've a whole lot to make up for.
That's what I intend to do.
[somber music]
Damn it.
Snow.
Oh.
I didn't know you were here.
What you doing?
Uh... Jesse asked me to run some tests to see if her genetic structure had changed.
Why did you ask Dr. Snow... to run tests on you again?
Because I got hit with a dark matter, okay?
I mean, that must have affected me somehow.
[pensive music]
You're not a meta-human.
What you are is a young woman with a genius-level IQ that we could use in our fight against this new wave of meta-humans.
Okay. All right, fine.
Fine.
[dramatic sting]
[gasps]
Snow?
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
[whooshing]
Is this it?
That's the one.
All right, great. Dad, Dr. McGee, Cisco.
Why don't you guys crack this open, see what you can find?
Sure.
We'll go see what kind of meta-human powers can take down a building like that and how to stop it.
Great.
Sounds like fun.
All right, I'm gonna go see if Joe needs any help in the streets. Everybody cool here?
Should be a piece of cake, right?
Hey, slugger!
Hey.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, sure.
What's up?
Well, I know you said that what happened to you in the Speed Force changed the way you see things, but you seem very optimistic, you know, with a lot of meta-humans running around tearing up the city.
What, did you see the future in there?
[laughs]
No... um... not this time.
No... I... look...
What I was shown in the Speed Force didn't just change my mind, it changed me.
I don't know... what you're seeing as optimism is, for the first time, I'm just not afraid anymore.
Great, that's...
But...
You know you still have to be careful, right?
What do you mean?
Well...
I don't... why are you trying to take something from me that I fought so hard to get to?
Barry!
I... you... you don't know everything that I've been through, Dad.
You haven't been here long enough to know.
I didn't mean... I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I think I do.
Hadn't been around.
Teach you how to drive or take you to look at colleges.
But I've done everything in my power to know who you are.
Barry, I don't want to take anything from you.
I believe in you.
This isn't about my not believing in you.
I know that.
And I'm fine. Okay?
Thank you, thank you very much for worrying about me.
I love you.
But I'm fine.
[alert beeping]
Come on.
What is that?
It's CCPD.
Zoom.
Barry.
Don't do it.
[whoosh]
You know, I never saw the crime photos of my mother's murder.
Well, I guess I didn't need to.
I have a ringside seat while you got whisked away.
Too delicate, I suppose.
[foreboding music]
Not just a hologram after all, are you, Flash?
Interesting.
I know you didn't call me up here just to banter.
Let's finish this.
Right now.
Actually, I did.
I called you up here to tell you you can't keep running from one meta to the next.
Around and around, like a dog chasing its tail.
I'll do whatever it takes to stop you.
If only that were good enough.
'Cause here's the thing.
I know you.
I know you, I know what's holding you back.
You and me... we're really just the same person.
[scoffs]
Yeah, you keep saying that, but it's not gonna make it true.
You'll see. We are.
Same tragic background.
Same reason for running.
Same desire to be the fastest, to be the best.
The difference?
You think your anger is dirty somehow.
You want to be seen as pure, the hero.
Doesn't it get exhausting?
Doesn't it get exhausting, Barry!
It was exhausting playing Jay, believe me.
I'm not pretending.
[electricity crackles]
[rumbling]
Now if it were me, I'd let that building tumble without a second thought.
But you, you'll never let that happen, will you?
That's why I'm gonna beat you, Barry.
Because you always have to be the hero.
And while you're playing the good little boy...
[dramatic music builds]
I'll be busy winning.
We can't let Zoom destroy another building.
We need to take him down.
Now.
And how do you propose we do that with an army of meta-humans laying waste to Central City?
We couldn't stop Zoom on my Earth.
What makes us different?
We're a team.
We start with the meta-humans, they're his armor.
We take them down first, then Zoom's more vulnerable.
Barry, we don't even know how many of his minions there are.
There could be hundreds, a thousand.
And all of them, they're all working with different powers.
It could take weeks to track them all down.
Guys, we don't have weeks.
So what we need do to is come up with a way to stop them all at once.
Again?
How?
Cisco, your goggles, your camera, they didn't work on Earth-2, right?
Yeah, it was a whole different frequency.
And the way you took down the Time Wraiths, that was based on frequency.
Hartley's entire shtick...
I think I'm smelling what you're stepping in.
Yeah.
So basically, we create some vibrational tech that can take down the Earth-2 metas.
Basically.
Oh, I gotcha.
Me too.
I'll help.
Okay.
I'll let you know if I hear anything from CCPN.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You guys... we got this.
[subtle uplifting music]
Barr, can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
[eerie music]
[thumping]
[dramatic music oscillates]
Birds.
Why?
It's like a Hitchcock movie in my head.
What's up?
Man, it's Wally.
Is he okay?
Not really.
Earlier, he thought it would be a good idea if he used himself as bait against a meta-human psycho.
Thought he could do things the way The Flash would.
Joe, I mean, he... he did tell me that he wasn't gonna waste the opportunity The Flash gave him.
I don't know if you can stop him.
I'm gonna have to or he's gonna get himself killed.
Look, he ain't you, Barry.
He can't just go Mach 50...
Mach 50 isn't a real thing.
The point is thinking you're invincible isn't any kind of armor.
Wally's already at a higher risk than I'm comfortable with, and him throwing caution to the wind on top of all that?
No.
We got to keep him safe.
So... in the Flash, talk to him.
Again.
Yeah, I'll talk to him. I'll try, I promise.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
[somber music]
I thought throwing things was Harry's preferred method of dealing with stress.
That is how frustrated I am right now.
I'm... just running out of ideas as to how to make this work. Where's Barry?
I need a taste of that "Walking on Sunshine" thing he's got going on right now.
[gasps]
No... No!
[whimpers]
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's me, okay?
Breathe. Breathe.
You're okay, all right? You're shaking.
I... I thought I saw him... Zoom...
I thought I saw him right there.
It's just me, okay?
Look at me, he's not here.
He's not here.
I see him everywhere.
Look, you literally just escaped a psychopath who kidnapped you, all right, so I think it's normal for you to have a severe reaction like this.
This is so much worse than that.
I... I'm afraid all the time.
I don't think I can ever move forward.
You will.
When?
Jay took everything from me.
My confidence, my trust, my sanity.
I don't think I'll ever be whole again.
Of course you will.
I promise.
[indistinct radio chatter]
Stealing is illegal, you know.
Detective West tells me that you've been fighting Zoom's army on your own.
Yeah. I want to help.
I admire what you're trying to do, but the best way to help is to just leave this to the police.
Like you did.
I do have powers, Wally. It is a little different.
This isn't your fight.
It's mine.
No, it's all of ours.
This is my city too now.
It's up to all of us to protect it.
[sentimental music]
Barry, we got a major meta-human alert at 5th and Main... get there.
5th and Main. Got it.
We'll continue this later.
[whoosh]
[epic music]
[sighs]
Why is it always so difficult to choose?
Barry, what it is?
It's...
Laurel Lance.
[dramatic music swells]
Laurel.
[chuckles]
Laurel Lance is dead.
On this Earth, anyway.
Poor Black Canary. Bye-bye, birdy.
Earth-2 Laurel.
You knew her doppelganger?
We didn't just know her, we loved her.
So... what do I call you?
You can call me Black Siren.
Zoom mentioned that you might be showing up.
If he told you what I can do, you should look more afraid.
And so should you.
Tell me, why did you take down Mercury Labs?
Because I like to watch things crumble and fall.
Guess what. You're next, red.
[sonic wail]
[dramatic music]
[groans]
You okay, Barry?
[sighs] Look.
Anything over 200 decibels will kill a human.
[groaning]
Was that too loud?
Perhaps we should quiet things down a bit.
[grunting]
[blows landing]
[groaning]
[groans]
You know, the sad thing is, I think Zoom's actually afraid of you.
And I didn't think that he feared anything.
[chuckles]
And you, you're hardly worth the chills.
How many metas did he send to try and kill you?
Well, it's too bad.
He should have just sent me because that way, you would have already been...
[tires screeching]
Get in.
[heroic music swells]
[engine revving]
Thought you might need a lift.
Yeah. Thanks.
You're welcome.
Why do so many villains that we go against use sound as a weapon?
What?
[laughs] Nothing.
You're gonna be fine.
Thanks.
So Wally just drove on up into the thick of it?
Mm-hmm.
Must have been some conversation you two had, seeing as though he did literally the opposite of what we wanted.
This I can hear.
It's not funny.
I'm sorry.
I'm in no laughing mood.
Look, Joe, I tried.
I told you I would try, right? I...
Wally's a determined kid.
Yeah, determined to get himself killed.
Or determined to help people.
And be glad, or you know, I would not be standing here right now.
Well, he was lucky tonight.
I don't want to see the day when he isn't.
We've got more than luck on our side, Joe.
You know you're not invincible, right?
Yes, of course, I know this.
[sighs]
Joe's being overprotective, but I get it.
Yeah, but it's like you think that nothing can touch you.
Like nothing bad can get in your way.
That's not true for any of us.
What are you saying?
Look, I know that you had an experience in the Speed Force.
And I'm happy that you think we're gonna win the day.
But I think a little fear can be a healthy thing.
It helps you determine which risks are worth taking.
I think that's something for both you and Wally to take to heart.
[somber music]
I met your little red friend tonight.
Aren't you going to ask me if I killed him?
You didn't.
You're good but not that good.
And yet I seem to be the only one of your top lieutenants still standing.
Like I said, you're good.
So why don't you go knock down a few more buildings?
Like I ordered.
What's the point?
The point is so that it seems random.
That way The Flash and his merry band won't realize what I'm up to till it's too late.
What are you up to?
No good.
[foreboding music]
Ow.
Sorry.
Ow!
There we go.
Are you kidding me with this?
Hey, at least it works.
Tremendous.
What is it exactly?
It's just a small source of joy, but more importantly, it's how we're gonna stop Zoom's army.
By giving them all electroshock therapy?
By giving them all dimensional shock therapy.
This is where I play stupid and you explain science.
Okay. Fair enough.
So all matter vibrates at its own unique frequency, right?
You disrupt that frequency, you disrupt the matter.
Like how an opera singer shatters glass with her voice.
Exactly. So we found out that all Earth-2 people vibrate at their own, more erratic frequency.
Higher frequency.
Different frequency.
Higher.
Higher frequency than we do.
Right.
So I ran this all past Hartley, right?
And he postulated that we could create a sort of dimensional tuning fork... VoilÃ ...
Okay, you didn't do it yourself.
Just let me have this one, okay?
Have it, have it.
Thank you.
So if you run around the city fast enough to create a refracting field, the device can send out a pulse that'll bounce off of it, split apart, and collide with itself over and over.
Amplifying it to an erratic frequency on the Earth-2...
Higher. Higher frequency.
Higher frequency on the Earth-2 spectrum.
And when that pulse hits anyone from Earth-2...
It'll disrupt their nervous system.
Earth-2 metas go night-night.
Even Zoom?
Even Zoom.
Harry and Jesse are from Earth-2.
How do we keep the pulse from hurting them?
Oh, Detective, I didn't know you cared.
Yes you did.
Uh, we designed these headphones to protect us from the pulse.
Beats by Wells. [laughs]
[alert beeping]
Cisco, it's your meta-human alert app.
That's the high-rise development on the west side.
Hundreds of people live there.
Ramon, we're up. Let's go.
Set that pulse off right now. Allen, you need to start generating that refracting field right now.
But Black Siren can take down this building at any point.
Wha... all those people, Wells.
How many more people are gonna die while we wait?
Guys, which is it?
I think I just got the worst idea of all time.
[ominous music]
I don't think I've taken down so many buildings at once.
Maybe you're not as powerful as you think!
[dramatic music]
What are you two doing here?
Why should you have all the fun?
I thought you two were dead.
Zoom thinks that too.
And we'd like to keep it that way.
For now.
You think you two can pull one over on Zoom?
Well, enjoy being dead.
I told you.
Give her a chance.
What chance?
She's not ready.
Excuse me.
Do you know what I'm capable of doing?
Try it, and I'll shatter your entire nervous system without breaking a sweat.
Wow, you really think you can take on Zoom.
We can.
You don't even know how powerful you are.
With a single call, you can take down a building.
I'd call that impressive.
But why... stop... there?
Why serve a master when you can be a master, when you can be a god?
We... could be gods.
[dramatic music swells]
All right!
All right.
We're synced up with whatever the heck that thing is.
Finally something we're both baffled by.
I'm kidding. That, my friend, is a 75KTSB 40,000-watt reverberating sound amplifier designed to single out the operating frequency of every single Earth-2 being on this planet... which, went contained and magnified by The Flash creating a sound pressure wall around the city, will render all of us Earth-2 beings unconscious.
Hence... the safety precautions.
I'm baffled by it.
[laughs]
Are we ready?
Yes, we are.
All right.
[device activating]
Here... we... go.
If I were interested in forming an alliance with you two, what's your plan?
Exactly?
We ambush Zoom at CCPD.
With our three powers combined, he'll be no match for us.
Hmm.
Well, I like the sound of that.
Great.
Then let's go.
There's just one more thing.
Reverb... catch.
You know, all doppelgangers... they're mirror images of themselves.
But you two, you didn't know that, did you?
Reverb is left-handed.
Well, I just... I just happened to... catch it with my right... run!
[dramatic music]
Oh, no.
What are we gonna do?
I don't think that there's anything you can do.
What the what?
I don't know.
Well, do it again!
[panting]
Cisco...
[alert beeps]
We're a go.
[frequency amplifying]
There's nothing on this Earth that can stop us!
[frequency wailing]
It's working.
[groans]
Yaaaahh!
Dad?
Dad, it hurts.
[whimpering]
No... no... stop...
It's okay.
No...
It's okay, honey.
[dramatic music flourishing]
Turn it off! Turn it off, it worked!
[sound stops]
It's okay, it's okay, we'll take care of him.
It's okay, Jesse.
He's gonna be okay.
Barry. We did it.
Bring them all in.
Copy that. I'm on clean up.
What's that? I can't... I can't hear you through the double-paned soundproof glass.
It's... it's kind of hard to make out what you're saying.
So should we tell Sara and Captain Lance about her?
No, I've seen what interacting with your family's doppelgangers can do.
It's not even Laurel.
No. It's just a poor imitation.
Speaking of, that was a pretty good Killer Frost you did back there.
Guess I was in the right head space to play a cold, vicious killer.
How you doing, are you okay?
No.
But I think I'm gonna be.
Being out there with you guys, fighting meta-humans, saving people...
It's the first time I felt normal in a long time.
Come here.
This is a group hug moment.
Yeah.
It is.
[peaceful music]
So all of Zoom's meta-humans are locked up in Iron Heights?
Most of them. Some are somewhere else.
I don't want to know.
No you don't.
And Zoom?
[whoosh]
The metas we spoke to said Zoom created a breach and escaped.
And how did he do that again?
Who knows, but he's back on Earth-2 now.
Earth-2?
That something else I don't want to know about?
No.
No.
All right. Well, Flash, thanks.
The man who saved Central City once again.
No, we're all just part of the same team.
Speaking of teams, where the hell is Allen?
Ooh... Sorry, man, sorry... hey.
Heard my name. Uh, what's up?
Good, well, you've got about 100 meta criminal cases to get through, so I would get to cracking if I were you.
I will get right on that.
Captain.
[snickers] Well done.
Thanks.
Listen, uh, I've been thinking about Wally some more.
Are you gonna talk to him again?
No, I'm not.
Why not?
Because he's your son, Joe.
I know he's my son.
I... look... what I mean is he's got your values.
He's got your inner drive to help people do what's right.
We're supposed to think we're something we're not until we become that thing.
That's the path that Wally's on.
I'm not gonna stop him from being the hero that he's gonna become.
I really don't think you should either.
[subtle uplifting music]
I can't wait till you have kids and they torture you.
I'ma laugh in your face.
[laughs]
All right, gramps.
Poppa.
What?
My grandkids are gonna call me "poppa".
[laughs] All right.
♪ Ah ah ♪

♪ When I was young ♪
What in the world?
What is this?
Blame Iris.
Okay.
I just figured that since Henry is officially back for good, we should celebrate.
And since Zoom is gone and the city is quiet right now.
Oh, I appreciate it, Iris.
Thank you.
Hi, Tina.
Hello, Henry.
Jesse.
Hi.
Good to see you.
Good to see you too.
You look... great.
Thank you.
I hope you don't mind that I invited Dr. McGee.
Seems like somebody's glad you did.
Mm-hmm.
So I guess you are invincible.
Told you.
[chuckles]
The Speed Force is with us.
Since I'm feeling extra invincible lately, what do you say you and I give this a shot?
Yeah, I would like that.
So is it true?
You saved The Flash's life?
Oh, I mean, I was just in the right place at the right time.
Proud of you, Wally.
You did good.
Thanks, dad.
[laughs]
What?
I'm just... I'm proud of you too.
Soup's on.
Hey!
Taking out a city full of monsters makes a man hungry.
First, a toast.
To family.
To family.
That's my kind of toast, short and sweet.
Let's eat.
[laughs]
[dramatic music oscillates]
Oh. You guys.
Great.
[overlapping screams]
Earth-2.
[epic music]
[dramatic music oscillates]
Cisco?
What... What is it?
What'd you see?
What do you mean "see"?
Cisco gets visions.
I don't understand.
What Cisco?
Earth-2 splitting in half.
Straight down to the poles.
Tell me I didn't just vibe the future.
Please tell me I did not just see the end of the world!
[foreboding music pounds]
Our story continues, Flash.
Henry!
Oh, my God.
[dramatic violin music]
Dad?
Dad?
It's poetic, returning to your childhood home.
Jay.
Don't do this.
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you! Take me.
Kill me!
No!
You still won't believe me that you and I are the same.
Come on.
Barry, look at me, son.
So I'm gonna have to make you believe me.
