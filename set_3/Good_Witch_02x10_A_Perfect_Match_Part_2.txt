Hey, Nick.
Hey, Cassie.
Let me take your coat.
Thank you.
I hope you brought your appetite.
I did.
Well, this is nice.
Oh, yeah!
Ah, the food looks great!
Mmm.
Why don't we do this more often?
You and Nick are welcome anytime.
So, uh, Grace.
Yes.
Did your teacher like your biology paper?
I got an A.
Surprise, surprise.
Aw.
And, Nick, I heard the good news.
A semester in London?
Well, it's a big trip, but he's up to it.
Well, if he's going. (CHUCKLES)
What's wrong with you?
I didn't mean to.
But you did.
It's the truth, is it not?
It's not your place to say!
It was an accident. I'm sorry.
Yeah, accidentally on purpose.
(SCOFFS)
Okay, okay, okay.
Wait, everybody to their neutral corner, all right?
So, what, you don't want to go to London?
I'm still thinking about it, all right?
Nick!
Excuse me.
Grace...
Well, that went well.
Hmm.
So much for a simple dinner.
Sam, this was never gonna be simple.
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
(CASSIE SIGHS)
Grace didn't eat much.
No, how about Nick?
He ate, but silently.
Hmm.
I still can't believe, as hard as he pushed to go to London, now, he may not even go.
Yeah, he's conflicted.
Maybe this isn't the best time to introduce something new to them.
We're friends and neighbors.
They're friends...
Well, there may be some bumps in the road, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.
Hmm.
You know, this isn't just something small.
It's not only one issue.
Grace has grown so fond of you, and you and I have a friendship that I wouldn't want to live without, so...
There are things to lose.
And things to gain.
(SIGHS) You don't know that for sure.
I know us.
Yeah? And what if it's bigger than us?
I think we should just take a breath and just deal with the issue at hand.
And what is that?
That these dishes aren't going to wash themselves.
(CHUCKLES)
Well, I'm glad you volunteered.
(CHUCKLES)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Oh! Can you see who that is?
It's John.
He's waiting for an answer on the Maldives.
And you have one for him?
I'm not gonna go.
(EXHALES) I'm surprised.
I mean, that dig is an opportunity that might not come around again.
Well, I had too many things pulling me toward home.
And you're happy with that decision?
Yeah.
Uh, the Maldives was tempting, but...
Middleton...
Even more so.
Well, I will try to make sure that your decision not to go is worthwhile.
Yeah, you better. (CHUCKLING)
(MARTHA SIGHS)
(CHUCKLING)
I need something.
Blue Vervain. It's good for stress and anxiety.
Well, I wouldn't need the tea if your cousin were doing her job.
Abigail?
Hmm.
The festival could be ruined.
And now, I can't find her to talk to her.
She's never where I think she'll be, and it's too late to find someone else.
Ah, I should have done it myself, but, you know, I have so much on my plate.
Oh, you're a born multitasker.
(SIGHS)
Cassie, I have to face the fact that for the first time in our town's history, the Middleton Lights Festival may go dark!
Oh, there's too much light inside of you to ever let that happen.
Aw...
Well, I'm afraid my bright and shining personality will not be enough to save the day.
You definitely can't do it alone.
You might need some of this later.
: Oh.
Hmm. Thank you.
(SIGHS)
But I don't think tea is going to save the festival.
(TARA CHUCKLING)
You made breakfast for me.
Well, first day at your new job.
Now, I've been thinking about it.
It really is the perfect job for me right now.
I mean, when we have a baby, I'll need something with flexible hours and not a lot of stress.
Well, I support you, whatever you want to do.
I do wish I had someone to talk to about things.
Hey!
You know what I mean.
I thought the feeling would go away, but...
I can't stop thinking about my mother.
I can understand that, but I don't think your mother is the answer.
People can change, if they really want to.
Trust me on this.
Leave the past in the past.
You're probably right.
And if you don't start eating soon, you're probably gonna be late.
: Eight designer cakes.
What was I thinking?
Ah, it's for a good cause.
And you can't say no to Cassie.
Stephanie?
Uh-huh?
Um, this is, uh...
This is my work station.
Well, it's just better to clean as you go.
Hmm, it's not better, it's just what you like to do.
Knock yourself out.
Thank you.
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
Tip to go to a job?
It's just a text from an old friend.
Oh, that's nice!
Yeah, I haven't heard from Cammy in a while.
"Cammy"?
We used to date.
Oh!
Ha! She's going to be in town for the festival.
(TIMER BUZZES)
Hmm.
That's me.
John, I owe you an answer.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I'm so flattered you asked me, and I know it would be an incredible adventure, but I'm not going on the dig.
(SIGHS)
Cassie, you'd be such an asset.
You need to do this.
To travel and to go from one adventure to another.
It's how you live your life. It's...
Well, it's what's important to you.
But it's not what's important to you.
Do you remember when we graduated college?
Yeah.
Big celebration.
It was.
Afterwards, when everyone was with their families taking pictures, I looked around the room and, in that moment, I knew what I really wanted in life.
And a degree, and speaking seven languages, and traveling all around the world wasn't gonna give me what I wanted.
A family.
I moved here, met Jake, and in more ways than one, I knew I was home.
And this makes you truly happy?
It does.
Just like traveling the world makes you happy.
Your life has really changed since the last time I saw you.
We're both doing what we love.
I'll see you at the festival?
Come by the Ferris wheel.
I'll make sure you get priority treatment.
(CHUCKLES)
Wow.
You turned down the handsome archeologist.
Things with Sam must be pretty serious.
I think you should worry less about my personal life and worry more about the festival.
Whatever do you mean?
Martha talked to the vendors.
Oh?
She's very concerned that they haven't talked to you.
But they talked to her.
She's considering canceling the whole festival, and that would be bad for everyone, especially you.
Nick, look. I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean to tell your dad that you're having second thoughts about going to London.
Please, talk to me.
Not everybody wants to talk about stuff.
But the stuff you don't want to talk about has to do with me.
Look, I had a feeling.
A feeling?
Yes, that you're going to get all the way over there and be unhappy.
My mom makes it look so easy.
What?
Whenever she tries to help, things get better.
Whenever I try and do it, things get worse.
I feel like a complete failure.
A failure?
Yes!
No! I'm the failure.
I bragged to everyone about how I was gonna spend a semester in London, and if I don't go, it'll look like I wimped out.
It might not be that bad.
My friends will never let me live this down.
I don't know, maybe I should go.
Just to save face?
What's the point of staying in town?
My dad's got a new job.
At the hospital.
It'll be just like New York.
Well, no, actually worse.
Now, he's the head of the whole hospital.
You think you're going to miss him.
It's been nice lately.
It's just the two of us.
That's why you're not sure you want to go.
Look...
No offense, but I wanna work this one out myself.
I've been thinking, maybe, we need to take a little break from each other.
Did you e-mail my "I'm not closing my practice" letter to all the patients?
Yes.
Any response?
A few people.
And?
They canceled their appointments.
(SIGHS) I guess, an e-mail is not going to convince people to trust that I won't leave them, like the last doctor.
You know, Jill was our first cancellation.
Yeah?
Maybe she can tell us what started all of this.
Don't worry, Dr. Radford, I will get to the bottom of this.
Good.
(PHONE DIALING)
Mmm, those look good. Are they for the festival?
For Abigail's store.
She hasn't asked me to cater the food for the festival this year.
None of the vendors I know have even heard from her.
And as I told Martha, I don't have enough time now to organize them all.
It does appear she has some work to do.
(CHUCKLES)
I miss being a part of it, but between my two businesses, I just don't have room for anything else.
Mmm, you have a lot more to give than you think.
I'm stretched pretty thin.
Too busy to do the cakes for the auction?
The children's library fund is a great cause.
I won't let you down.
Okay.
You seem stressed.
Well, it's not all work.
(EXHALES)
A woman Ben used to date texted him.
You're not worried that he's interested in anyone else?
They dated for over a year.
I mean, I know people whose marriages didn't last that long.
Hey, Sam.
Hey, what a nice surprise.
Hi.
I put a little treat in here for Eve.
Oh, thanks, but I'm not heading back to the office.
I've got a lot of meetings in the hospital.
Oh! Well, then, I put an extra treat in there for you.
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you.
I didn't expect the job to start until next week, but they want me in there now.
Sounds like a lot more work.
Well, it's pretty intense, but I got it handled.
And I like being busy.
Mmm, there's a difference between busy and overloaded.
You don't have to worry about me.
I always worry about people I care about.
My patients think that being Chief of Staff at Hillcrest means I won't be here.
Hmm, maybe you need to find a way to show them that they can trust you.
That's a tall order.
I think you're up to the challenge.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Tara?
(RINGING CONTINUES)
Hello?
Uh, no, you have the right number.
She's just not here right now.
This is her husband. Is this Donna?
Oh.
Okay, uh...
I will let her know you called.
We track individual sales of the day here with the total income here.
Oh, let me take notes.
(DOOR OPENING)
Oh, I forgot my phone.
Oh, I have paper.
Oh, I'm expecting a call.
You can use my phone.
Yeah, but, I don't know her number.
It's my mom.
Oh, I didn't know you were in contact.
She wants to talk.
She was supposed to call today, but, please, don't tell Brandon.
He doesn't know?
Well, he thinks I'll get hurt.
But not knowing what happened hurts more.
Yeah.
Yeah, when I was pregnant with Grace...
Oh, there was so many things I was going through that I wanted to share with my mom.
Growing up without a mother leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions.
But Brandon doesn't get why I need to understand why she left, and only she can tell me that.
People don't always know the reasons for their actions.
But if I don't talk to her, I'll never know.
Ah!
Hello, Martha!
It's locked.
But she asked me to deliver these cookies.
Well, she promised to meet me here, so we could finally talk about everything that she's not doing for the festival.
This is the final straw! I have no choice.
I'm gonna have to cancel the festival.
Now, I just have to figure out how to make the announcement to everybody.
I'll help you get the word out.
It's gonna be fine. Let's make all the calls.
Aw, those are lovely, George!
A perfect way to showcase the cakes for the festival.
Well, word is there isn't going to be a festival.
So why am I making these?
Sometimes, you just have to keep going, even in the face of doubt.
Faith?
Exactly.
Ah.
Hey!
Hey.
What are you making?
Cake trays.
I only have to make seven more.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
And those are for?
For the festival.
Hmm.
You know, I hear the view from that Ferris wheel is supposed to be breathtaking.
And I would really like to see that view.
Okay.
Have you talked to Grace yet?
I haven't, she's had a very full schedule.
I'm gonna talk with Nick tonight.
It's not just the kids that complicate things for us.
I know, but they're an important complication.
We gotta start somewhere.
You are very wise.
Oh, you think so?
So, Doc, you're here to help out?
Um, I would, but, um, I've got to get dinner for Nick and then I have a Skype meeting with a cardio specialist from the west coast.
Mmm.
Wow, great.
But good luck.
(LAUGHING) Okay.
Hey, what are you making?
Dinner.
(CHUCKLING) Looks good to me.
Hey, I can tell you don't want to talk about London, but can you at least help me understand what's going on inside your head?
It's my first trip on my own.
I don't know how I'm gonna feel, when I get there.
What if I hate it, or I can't cut it?
If I cancel, it will be embarrassing enough.
Oh, it shouldn't be an embarrassment.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Ah.
Voice mail.
There's, um, something else that I've been wanting to talk to you about.
(PHONE RINGING)
I'll... I'll get it.
(RINGING CONTINUES)
Hello?
Yeah.
He's here.
The hospital.
Hmm.
Yeah, it's Dr. Radford.
Yeah.
No, I've got five minutes.
Tonight? Sure.
Okay, we need to tell the vendors that are booked, the vendors that are on hold and everyone in town that the festival is canceled!
I can make the calls. I know most of them from the past festivals.
I think I need some more of Cassie's calming tea.
: Don't worry, Martha.
The town will understand. It was out of your hands.
(GASPS) Yes!
We need more hands.
Cassie said I can't do it alone!
It was always too big for one set of hands, but what about two?
If you're going to call all the vendors, why not call to confirm their services instead of cancel?
What do you think of Don Benjamin for new head of cardiology?
He's a great surgeon, but he's too hard on the nurses, and everybody else.
I don't think he's a great fit for the hospital.
Hmm.
Jim Hart's in town from Chicago visiting family.
Hmm.
He's got a good reputation.
I think I can get him on the phone tonight.
Ah, I hadn't planned to be here this late.
Oh, your assistant can order in food.
That way we can do the call, then go over the residents' evals.
I can do that in the morning.
After grand rounds?
Ugh, I don't think I'll have time for rounds.
I have to go by my office in Middleton, and I want to have breakfast with my son.
I know it'd be good for the residents to see you in action.
What do you think?
Hmm, they're very pretty.
But are they me?
Well, they could be.
You think they would go with that velvet dress I have?
The green one?
Some people would think you might not want to draw attention to yourself.
The festival is being planned just as it should have been all along.
Hi, Sam!
Hey.
I'm looking forward to seeing both of you together at the festival.
(CHUCKLES)
She sure is calm, for somebody whose leadership skills are being called into question.
Confidence is one of Abigail's strongest personality traits.
I was thinking, with the kids the way they are, and sensing you might be feeling a little bit rushed, we don't have to "go together" to be together at the festival.
Yeah, we can just meet there.
Well, we can meet up at...
Face painting.
(LAUGHING) Uh, no.
Aw, you'd look so good as a lion. (GROWLS)
(LAUGHING) Nothing says "Chief of Staff" like some whiskers.
Nah, I better pass.
Okay, um... Cotton candy.
Okay, but to be clear, I get my own bag.
It's nice to share.
I only get fair food, like, once or twice a year.
I'm not sharing. Not even with you.
Mmm.
Oh! Here's an idea.
Ah! Ferris wheel.
8:00?
Don't be late.
For you? I'll be early.
Oh, come on.
We might be down, but we're not out.
I talked to Jill.
Apparently...
I'm the one who said the office was going to close.
That's why everyone thought when you took the hospital job, you were closing here.
It was me.
Back up.
I made a little joke.
When Jill called, I said, "Let's get you an appointment while we're still in business."
Why?
I wasn't sure if you were gonna take the hospital job or not, and that made me nervous, and when I get nervous, I, um...
Make bad jokes?
I should have just asked you what was going on.
Yes, you should have.
But why didn't you tell me?
I'm superstitious.
Well, I don't like to talk about a job until I sign the contract.
Mmm-hmm. I wish I had known that.
I do, too.
What's that?
From Cassie.
She must be helping Martha organize the kids' craft area.
It's a big draw at the festival.
"I trust you will put these to good use with all the kids and their parents."
Lots of people, huh?
Yeah.
Everyone stops by to see what the kids are making.
It's different every year.
Thank you for coming.
: Hi!
Hey!
I brought both of you lunch.
Oh, that's thoughtful of you.
Join us?
I can't.
I gotta get back to work.
Oh, um, I meant to ask you, did you answer my phone yesterday?
Uh, no.
: Huh.
I had a recent call from an unknown caller, but no message.
I don't know.
Oh, um, there's only one sandwich in here.
What? I ordered two.
Uh, I'll go back to the Bistro and get the other one.
No, let me. I want to go stretch my legs anyway.
: Okay.
Hmm.
You're gonna tell her?
If Cassie needs another eight cakes next year, she has to tell us sooner.
Who knows what will happen next year?
Well, I imagine there'll be another festival, seeing as it's an annual thing.
A lot can happen in a year.
Yeah, but some things are constant, like annual things.
You never know how long something's gonna last.
: Okay.
Oh, no!
(GASPS)
This bottom layer has completely collapsed on itself.
By the time I get this to the festival, this three-layer cake is gonna be a two-layer cake, and it's gonna be a huge mess!
They'll have seven cakes.
Cassie needed eight!
She'll understand.
Ben, it's for charity!
I'll fix it.
No, I can figure it out.
Okay, I'll help you.
No, you don't have to.
What's going on with you?
It's Cammy, isn't it?
(SIGHS)
Cammy and I could have dated for five years, we would never have been serious.
I just spent the last three days locked up in a catering kitchen with you.
If that's not serious, then I don't know what is.
You get the other seven cakes to the festival, and I'll meet you there with the eighth.
Okay?
Okay.
Hey!
Hi.
How are things?
Oh...
Nick is pretty broken up about London.
He just needs to find the right adventure.
I think you're right.
I might know of something.
You're always looking out for Nick.
And me.
I care about you two.
Well, I've got to go to the office, swing back by here and pick up Nick, and I'll meet you at the festival.
8:00?
Count on it.
Sam?
Be careful tonight.
Biology?
No, physics.
Ooh.
Well, I thought you could use a pick-me-up.
Ugh, please. My brain is literally fried.
Oh, I should have made that an iced tea. (CHUCKLES)
Oh, Mom.
Mmm.
I really made a mess of things with Nick.
Mmm, I don't believe that.
I tried to help.
I thought that if I could get him to understand how hard it would be to be so far away from home, that he'd stay.
Well, sometimes, an opportunity for something great comes from something small.
You just have to keep your eyes open.
What's wrong, Mom?
I want to talk about your father.
(SIGHS) You know I loved him very much.
With all your heart.
When he died, a part of my heart died with him.
He loved you so much, Mom.
Yeah, it was once in a lifetime.
Which is why I was so surprised when I started to feel the way I felt about your father with someone else.
I, um...
I saw you and Sam.
Oh.
Look, as much as I like Sam, I've just never really seen you kiss anyone...
But your father.
Give me time.
Of course.
I want you to be happy.
I love you. Come here.
Um, I almost forgot.
I'll be busy with the cake auction, but it's important that John gets this.
I could give it to him.
That would be perfect.
Done.
So, are you, um, ready to go to festival?
(SIGHS)
What's wrong?
I have just officially told my teacher I'm not going to London.
I just wish I didn't feel like a total coward for backing out.
You just made a very tough decision.
That's not cowardice.
That's bravery.
Thanks, Dad.
(SIGHS) Look, there's...
Something else I've been wanting to talk to you about.
(SIGHS) It's Cassie.
I mean, you know that we've become really good friends since we moved here.
But now, we're both interested in something more.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Ah.
(SIGHS)
Dr. Radford. (SIGHS)
: Hey. NICK: Hey.
I want to apologize.
You already did.
I know, but...
Nick, I was trying to help, but maybe, I was pushing my feelings on you.
And by the way, you were right.
I am much happier staying closer to home.
You were trying to help.
It's over anyway. I just e-mailed my teacher.
Wait...
You're really not going?
Not going.
: Look, uh...
I can't go to the festival right now.
Why don't you guys just go on without me, and I'll meet you there.
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
: Wow! It's really coming together.
Yeah. Hey, save me a hot dog!
(CHUCKLES)
Thanks again for volunteering, boys.
And, uh, maybe save some for everyone else.
: Oh, busted.
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, don't mind if I do.
: Oh! No, no, no, no, no!
Yoo-hoo! You there, up in the tree!
The lights are too close together, they're all bunched up, can you separate them?
The tables look lovely.
Thanks, Tara.
Hello, Martha.
Hmm.
Hello, I...
(GASPS)
How did this...
This is not how I left it.
Well, it just needed a little more sparkle.
(CHUCKLES)
And a lot of hands.
Hands...
: My dad told me about your mom.
I think they're gonna start dating.
Yeah, I think so.
Oh, gosh, I've never imagined anyone with my mom, besides my dad.
Yeah, it's, um, weird.
(LAUGHS)
: Hey, you know, I almost forgot, I have to drop this off for my mom.
Her friend John is working the Ferris wheel.
He's an archeologist.
Whoa!
Yeah.
He's actually heading to the Maldives in a few months on an archeological dig.
That's really cool.
Hey, John.
Hey, there.
This is my friend Nick.
Nice to meet you, Nick.
Nice to meet you.
I was telling him about your upcoming trip to the Maldives.
Oh, yeah. Pretty exciting.
Uh, by the way, this is from my mom.
(SIGHS) Your mom found this in India.
That's Sanskrit.
We're studying about the Maldives in our World Culture class.
Most kids your age can't find it on a map.
It must be so cool to be an archeologist.
I love it, yeah.
I mean, there is a lot of grunt work involved.
I'm bringing a bunch of students with me on this dig, even a few from a Chicago high school for a couple of weeks.
Just a two-week shift.
Just to help carry equipment and assist the diggers.
Just two weeks?
Would it be too late to add another student?
Oh, there's always room for another set of hands.
So, what does the note say?
"For luck."
Thank you.
: Amazing.
Thank you for asking me to bake these cakes.
I think it was just what was needed this year.
Well, as it turns out, it's just what I needed too.
Hey.
So, it looks like my festival is coming together flawlessly.
: No, not flawlessly.
: Well...
: A lot of effort went into making this happen.
(YAWNING) I know.
(CHUCKLES)
All these years, Bonnie was able to make Martha think that Bonnie was doing all the work, when really Martha was calling the shots.
You helped Martha?
This year, with Bonnie gone, Martha wanted to take the festival back, but she didn't think she could do it.
So, I created a crisis.
When there's a crisis, you don't second guess yourself.
You just do what has to be done.
From this point on, the festival is back in the right hands.
Martha's.
Mmm-hmm.
But I did it all for Middleton.
Uh-huh.
If you'll excuse me, I have an interview to do.
He's from a big Chicago paper.
Loves doing stories on small business owners in small towns.
I'm thinking about expanding my business, adding an online component, reach a bigger audience.
You can't buy publicity like this.
No, you can't.
You're looking for Sam?
Yes, he's meeting me at the Ferris wheel at 8:00.
Well, he'd never keep you waiting.
Hello, I'm Abigail of Abigail's Flower Market.
Thank you for coming all this way.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
(FAIRGROUND BELL RINGING)
Hey, what's wrong?
I know you had your eye on this little guy, but I called him so...
The festival is a celebration, right?
That means "happy."
It's my own fault.
Look, I know you didn't want me to, but I contacted my mom.
I'm sorry. I know how you felt about her, but I needed to do it.
She told me she'd call me yesterday, and she never did.
You were so right about her, again.
I mean, she disappointed me again!
I... (SCOFFS)
You'd think I'd learn, but...
(SIGHS) I just feel so stupid.
Anyway...
I sent her an e-mail and I told her that I changed my mind, and I don't want to speak to her.
Ever.
I'm just gonna leave the past in the past.
You know, a candy apple might make me feel better.
I'll be right back.
(FAIRGROUND BELL RINGING)
Tara seems upset.
She is.
But I don't think there's anything I can do now.
Trying to protect people, sometimes we end up hurting them more.
I'm sorry.
You don't want one?
More for me.
Your mother did call.
That unknown caller on your phone...
What?
I was trying to protect you.
You lied to me?
I thought it was the right thing to do, but now, I see that I can't protect you from whatever your mother is gonna do.
But I can help you through it.
You may have ruined my one chance at reconnecting with my mother.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
That is looking amazing.
When you're done, we'll hang it, okay?
Oh!
Courtesy of Dr. Radford.
Hey.
Oh, hi!
I love the lanterns!
(LAUGHS)
You sent that box of stuff over and Sam got inspired.
I had a feeling.
(CHUCKLES)
Seems like you've done your own crafts as well.
Yeah, Dr. Radford's idea.
"Free well-check visit good for a year." Hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
He said he needed to show everyone in town that he was serious about being Middleton's doctor.
He thought this might be the right way to get the message out.
I think it just might be.
Have you seen him?
No, I haven't.
Oh, well, I'm sure he's going to be very happy when he sees I'm almost out of handouts.

We're all set to go.
Yeah, uh, Sam's not here yet.
Well, where is he? It's nearly 9:00!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
The cake auction closes in one hour, so make sure you've placed your bids.

Hello, everybody, and thank you for coming!
For those of you who don't know me, I am Abigail Pershing of Abigail's Flower Market, on Main Street.
And let me be the first to welcome you to Middleton's Annual Lights Festival.

(CROWD CHEERING)
So, if everyone could grab their coats and make their way outside to the Ferris wheel, we can get started.
What are you up to?
You'll see.
(MARTHA LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
: Thanks.
(ALL MURMURING)
: (OVER PHONE) 
(CROWD CHEERING)
: Three, two, one...
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)
