Call me Donatello.

He had no idea he was next in line after Kevin.
How would he? He hadn't gotten hit by the God power yet.
What about Amara? She's your sister.
I took responsibility for her, too.
Locked her away.
So you're just gonna let Amara win?
How is death by your sister a strategy?
I know her.
She's gonna eliminate you, and then she's gonna destroy everything that you've created.
She's told me this, personally.
You need all the help you can get.
The plan is to rescue Lucifer from Amara.
Then he teleports us out of Amara's hideout, and we convince Chuck to use him to fight her.
And how are we supposed to keep Amara busy while we're... liberating Lucifer?
Where are your thoughts?
Something's different.
All right, Metatron, come on!
It's okay, Sam. You go. I got this.

[ Banging on door ]
Lucifer!
You know, at some point in time, you're gonna have to come out and -- and talk to...
God. [ Clears throat ]
This is like the worst episode of “Full House” ever.
[ Volume decreases ]
: If Dad has something to say to me, I'll hear it from him.
Until then, I'll be in my room.
It's not your room.
It's my room.
[ Volume increases ]
Whatever.
We can do this.
Lucifer stole the throne.
His authority weakens the longer he's M.I.A.
The time is ripe for a coup.
That's why I brought you here.
Together, we can reclaim the throne.
Together, we can make Hell great again.
[ Snickers ]
Of course, I'll need your help recruiting others.
When the numbers are in our favor, we'll strike, and each and every one of you will have earned a place at my side.
[ Laughs ]
Told you he'd do this.
“He”? Do what?
What you always do.
Promise a return to Hell's former glory -- promises you never make good on.
How about a rundown of your recent rule?
First, you were Rowena's bitch.
Then Dean Winchester's.
Then Amara's, then Lucifer's.
A few weeks ago, you were cleaning these floors... with your tongue.
We could retake Hell, but why bother?
The world's ending, and this time...
Hell's ending with it.
[ Door opens ]
Unless you've got a plan to defeat the Darkness.
Well, then, this is just more of the same --
King Crowley's bad dinner theater.
If that's the way you feel, why did you show?
We wanted to see the monkey dance... one last time.
[ Door closes ]
: Talk to him.
Won't do any good.
Why not?
'Cause I can't give him what he wants.
And what's that?
What everyone wants -- my sister, my children, you humans -- an apology.
A big, wet “I'm sorry.”
Well, so give it to him.
It's not like he's asking for a weapon or for Hell or for Heaven.
He's asking for words.
[ Sighs ] I can't say I'm sorry if I'm not.
What he wants an apology for, I did it for humanity, for the world.
Look, Lucifer wants what everybody wants -- Amara gone.
Okay, let's just...give him a little time to cool off.
Okay, well, I don't know if you noticed, but a little time is not something we have.
The end is freakin' nigh.

Hmm.
Rowena.
Door not locked.
What all that astral projection bull for?
We're hardly on the best terms, Clea.
Before barging in, I just wanted to check for hex bags or a --
That.
What you want?
I'm working on a spell. It requires a second.
A second?
Well, why don't you ask Charisse or Melodie or Thomasin?
Oh, yeah, you torched them all in one of your impetuous little fits.
The world's ending, Clea.
[ Thunder rumbles ]
Well, duh.
The end times shouldn't bother you, though, Row.
You a rat.
Find your way off any sinking ship.
Damn right.
The spell I'm working on is Book of the Damned magic, and it can get us back.
We can buy ourselves a few more centuries of life.
Turn back the clock for us... before the world inevitably goes bye-bye.
You're scared.
Aye.
I came face-to-face with the Darkness.
The apocalypse bell's been rung a few times in our day, but when I looked inside her, I saw it.
Not just the end of the world, Heaven and Hell -- the end of magic.
Greek antiquity... or no deal.
Middle Ages.
I know, not the best time to be a witch.
Or a black woman.
And the Greek Age was better?
I'm a fan of the classics. I'll make it work.
Deal.
One of you is gonna have to, uh, go first.
You know what? Uh, Lucifer, y-you, uh... you agreed to have a sit-down if -- if God would show, so...
And, Chuck, you -- you did say you'd talk.
Him first.
I'm the one who's owed an explanation.
[ Sighs ]
Okay, let's -- let's try “I feel” statements.
Dr. Phil.
Huh?
: Oh, yeah, of course.
Obviously.
I am sorry that you feel... that I betrayed you, that I acted without cause.
I'm sorry that you can't see you gave me no choice.
I'm good.
You heard that, right?
W-We all know that you are God, um, but... maybe could you be a-a little less...Lordly?
But I am -- I-I'm the Lord.
Wow. There he goes.
I did what I had to do.
To create the world, I had to lock Amara away.
And when the Mark corrupted you and I saw that you posed a threat to humankind, I did the same with you.
No, you betrayed me.
You gave me the Mark to lock her away, and when it changed me, when it did what the Mark inevitably does... you threw me away.
No, Son. The Mark --
You always cast a jaundiced glance at humans.
The Mark didn't change you.
It just made you more of what you already were.
What I was was your son... your child.
Why should I put you first above all others?
Do you have any idea what it's like to argue with your father when your father is God?
Everything is a tautology with you.
Everything is, “Because I told you so.”
Everything is, “It 
 to be done.”
Pretty sure that's all fathers.
[ Clears throat ]
Okay.
Fine.
Big picture, as God, you did what you had to do.
But little picture -- you sucked at being a dad.
Okay, maybe I didn't handle everything perfectly.
But tell me... could I have kept humankind safe with you on the board?
I know about your little bid to replace me with the angels.
Okay, “New God,” what would you have done about you?
That is not the point!
I-I can't believe I'm actually about to say this, but, um...
Lucifer is right.
A-All he wants is an apology, a-and you're too concerned about being right to -- to give him one.
But apologies aren't always about being right.
Sometimes they're just about apologizing.
Yeah, a-and the great thing about apologies is you don't have to mean them.
You know, I-I lie and tell Sam I'm sorry all the time.
I'm sorry.
See?
That's...
Okay, enough from the peanut gallery.
[ Grunts ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Sighs ]
What?
What would you have done?
It doesn't matter.
You were my father, and you forsook me.
I did.
I was supposed to love all creation equally.
I wasn't supposed to have favorites.
But you...
You were mine.
I gave you the Mark because I loved you the most... because I thought you were strong enough to bear it.
And when I saw that I was wrong... when I watched my choice... devour my... most cherished son...
I hated myself.
And so I punished you.
And I am so sorry.
♪
Hey.
So...are we good?
Okay. Great.
So what now?
We trap Amara, put her back in the box.
Wait, what?
Yeah. Well, you were right.
She needs to be destroyed.
But I won't kill her.
Why not?
Amara's been caged for billions of years, but... you know, she was always there.
She had to be there -- you know, yin and yang, you know, uh, dark and light.
English, Chuck.
[ Sighs ]
There's a harmony, a balance in the universe.
Light needs dark, dark needs light.
If you blow one of them up, then, I mean...
It wouldn't be a good thing.
It'd be really not a good thing.
Like, end of reality, not good.
Okay, so we gift-wrap Amara.
I mean, we got the team back together, so --
: Not quite.
We're still a few members short of the original lineup.
Yeah, first time, it took the combined strength of me and my brothers to weaken Amara before...
Daddy-o finished her off.
Yeah, even then, it was close.
No, with just the two of us, we'll lose.
Okay, so, what, we'll need more group therapy between you and the archangels if we want to have a shot?
Well, Michael's in no condition to fight.
And it's outside of my power to bring Gabriel and Raphael back.
But you restored Castiel.
Archangels are different.
They're the stuff of primordial creation.
Rebuilding them, it's -- it's time we don't have.
All right. So what do you need to win?
What do you got?
So what do we bring to the table to make up for archangel power?
We could try and find more Hands of God.
A little redundant.
Well, what about Crowley?
Big demon power, former king of Hell.
He was a player in his day.
Stealing my moves, Dean?
Let me guess.
You got Lucifer back in the fold.
He snapped you here.
No, it wasn't Lucifer.
Ah-ah-ah!
It's time to sober up.
You smell like a Dumpster outside the Liquor Barn.
What's this? Concern for me?
I appreciate your attempts at bro-mantic rekindling.
But I think we both agree that ship has sailed.
That's not what this is about.
We need your help.
We have the angels.
And here I thought I had made real inroads with you guys.
You thought wrong, Serpent.
Serpent. We loathe you.
We'll always loathe you.
Welp...
I came here to ask a good-faith favor of you folks, but as you are... clearly less than kindly disposed, perhaps you'll, uh, lend an ear to my very own Jiminy Cricket.
Hmm?

[ Breathing heavily ]
Hello, brothers.
Sisters.
Castiel?
It's me.
Rowena. I mean, she's a snake, but she's a powerful witch.
And she's got the Book of the Damned.
We've got the owl feather and the yarrow root.
Check and check.
A jaw of pig?
Check.
What are you doing here, Giant?
Give it!
Not till we've talked.
You walked right into a powerful coven.
Ah, it takes three for a coven.
Witch's den... without a weapon.
I'll turn you into a moose -- an actual moose.
You can't.
Read his aura.
He under some potent protection.
Never seen that before.
Hear the man out.
Well?
We need you.
Getting these groups to enlist and then work together, it's not gonna be easy.
Couldn't you just compel them?
I invented free will for a reason.
So we're tying our hands on principle?
No, you can't make an effective soldier by force.
They have to choose this fight.
But they're gonna want to know they're backing a winner.
So...
So... [ Chuckles lightly ] We're gonna play the God card.
[ Laughs ] God's back.
You've tricked me before, Samuel.
Why would I believe a word you say?
It would explain that aura of protection.
Not no regular magic.
Clea, dear, is this how it's going to be with us in Crete?
Even if God's back, why would I care?
Hello, pagan here.
I serve magic, not God.
Sorry.
Not interested.
I am.
What? I can't serve both?
Let's hear it from Him.
In good time.
Do I have your support?
I can't even look at you, Castiel.
You befouled yourself with the Deceiver.
You know, every second that I've spent subordinating myself to Lucifer, it's been a torment.
It's destroying me, it's burning through my vessel.
But I would do it all over again, because through me, he and God, they will defeat the Darkness.
That's my role in this fight.
It's God's fight.
You can play a part in that fight, too... if you join me.
No.
Row, you brought me a plan to escape.
This here's an opportunity to fight and win.
She's right.
Nobody's talking to you, big and tall.
I can enlist others.
Sister witches.
You're mad.
We don't stand a chance against Amara!
Rowena, honey... there is a chance.
Game of thrones. It's musical chairs.
Still...
I wanted it -- to go out with the crown on my head!
And that's what you offered them, a chance to stroke your ego?
And you wonder why they said no.
Well, we've got something better -- a plan.
Now, you can sit on the sidelines and watch the world die... or you can fight.
You know, to be king again, maybe you need to remember how to be a soldier.
What's the plan?
We assemble our band of brothers, hit Amara with everything we've got.
Then when she's weak...
I finish her off.
So... a page from the original playbook.
This time with witches and demons subbing for archangels.
Exactly.
I still don't like it.
But why trap her when you can kill her, you know?
I-I mean, you got to admit, there's a lot less room for error if you shoot to kill.
I explained why.
Right, but why keep her in play?
So she can escape and we can go through this all over again?
Dean, what is this about?
I -- Nothing.
Am I the only one thinking rational here?
It's about her.
Sam, it's about his girlfriend.
Okay.
Shut up.
I mean, think about it.
Dean Winchester meets the biggest evil in the universe, and he takes a pass?
Come on.
Now he wants Daddy to do what he couldn't.
Is he right?
Oh, I'm not getting into it with him.
Not gonna happen.
Hey, Dean.
Come on, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
We opened a vein for you two.
I tried to kill her.
And it didn't work.
Maybe it didn't work because you didn't want it to work.
Maybe you didn't want to kill her.
You want God to kill Amara because you don't want Amara to be killed?
Yeah, maybe there's a part of me that just can't hurt her.
But if she's already dead...
Then she's already dead.
Right.
Well, that got weird.
Dean...
[ Scoffs ]
...we always sweat this stuff, these choices.
But, for once, we have God on our side.
I mean, for once, we can actually just do things his way.

Simple... bordering on insane.
It's suicide.

It's good to finally meet you in person.
Sorry about, well, everything I've ever done in my life.
Really, y-you can't have been a fan.
Oh, yeah, I've been quietly rooting against you both for some time now.
Although, I can't deny you're one of my guilty pleasures.

Oh, 
All right, no flirting, and no fighting.
: Yeah, and no deals.
No talks about who is owed what if we survive this.
Nobody likes each other.
It doesn't matter.
We only have the fight ahead.
Amara's looking for me.
But I'm warded against her, for now.
The second I drop the warding, she'll show.
She'll be expecting a fight, and we'll give it to her.
Shock and awe. Shock and awe.
You have your troops in position?
[ Clears throat ] Yes, Rowena?
Fabulous plan...God, but doesn't this strategy strike anyone as a wee bit un-strategic?
Shouldn't we at least try to catch her off guard?
Is that sequence set in stone?
Demon, angel, witch power?
Seems to me that the first response should come from the most disposable force.
: Right! Good argument, Doggie.
Demons first, it is.
The weakest should go first.
Naturally, that means the witches.
Enough.
: After that, it's Lucifer's turn.
Physical attack, one on one.
What about Cass?
Oh, don't worry.
Your pet's safety is my highest concern.
Trust me, he's on board.
Once she's been weakened, I will take the Mark back from Amara and use it to seal her away.
You ready?
Yeah.
Wait, what?
God and I talked about this.
Someone needs to bear the Mark.
Well, that should be me.
I-I've had it before. I'm damaged goods.
Exactly. You've already been tainted.
I can't transfer it to you.
Sam volunteered.
First Cass is making kamikaze side plans and now you?
You couldn't have talked to me?
We did talk.
And what happens when the Mark turns you psycho, then what?
You...lock me up where I can't hurt anyone.
And you throw away the key.
Sam, no.
Dean, you told me you couldn't beat Amara, that it would have to be me.
Well, this is it -- me.
I'm just saying, angels can hurt her.
It's worked before.
If you call giving Amara a mild case of the pukes working.
We're trying to disorientate her as much as hurt her.
You underestimate witchcraft, Fergus, always have.
If anything, she's inoculated.
Full-scale demon attack.
That's our “X” factor.

We talked about this.
It's time to do the smart thing.
So, what am I supposed to do, just sit by and watch?
