Can you hear me?
Dean.
Cass?
Hey, is that you?
Hey, can you hear me?
All right.
[ Groans ]
Lucifer is gone.
Amara ripped him from my body.
To where?
I don't know.
Come on.
Are you, uh...
H-How do you feel?
Ohh.
You know when you're driving and a bug hits your windshield?
I'm the bug.
So, what Amara said about you...
Dying.
Yeah, whatever she did to me, I can feel my spark, my light fading.
And when it's gone...
Okay, well, t-tell us how to fix you.
You can't.
I-I-I suppose she could, maybe, but that's never gonna happen.

I didn't know dogs had breakfast.
Cass is back.
Just curious -- has anyone bothered to look outside?

What is it?
It looks like the sun is --
Dying.
Why would Amara do that?
The sun is the source of all life on earth.
Without it, everything just... just wastes away.
Let's get the hell out of here.
[ Snaps ]
You.
Still got a few tricks up my sleeve.
I'm not dead y...
: Oh, whoa.
Okay. I got you.
I should probably sit down.
Yeah. Come on.
[ Groans ]
All right.
Okay.
What do we do now?
[ Bottle clap clatters ]
Really?
[ Sighs ] Really.
What?
We hit Amara with everything we got, and she walked it off.
So...
So it's last call?
That's right.
Look, man.
If you've got something for me to punch, shoot, or kill, let me know and I'll do it.
I'll do it till I die.
But how are we supposed to fix the friggin' sun?

You know what? This isn't gonna be enough.
I better make a run. [ Sighs ]

You want to?
No!

Charles, I'll put the kettle on.
My mom always said, there's nothing a nice wee cup of tea can't fix.
Be right back.
I'll stay here, find our Plan B.
Okay.
Cass, come on.

She's using you.
It's what she does.

She's been...nice.

Now's kind of all we got.
Whatever.
I'm not calling you Dad.

All the way.
Right.

Now, Fergus

Walked before his first birthday, but he hated pants.
Hated them.
He'd run 'round the village, his wee banger just flapping in the breeze.
Adam and Eve were the same way.
Kids.   Kids.
I'm so glad the world is ending.
Samantha!
W-What are we doing?
Nothing.
Exactly.
Amara's out there eating the freaking sun, and -- and we're doing

Yes. Anything.
That's my better idea, because anything is better than 
Sam. I get it.
Even if we could lock Amara away, it wouldn't do any good now.
I'm dying.
And when I'm gone, a cosmic balance between light and dark -- it's over.
All right.
[ Slams table ]
Then if we can't cage her, we have to kill her.
Bingo.
[ Engine rumbles ]
How you doing? You good?
I mean, you know, the whole Lucifer thing.
I was just... so stupid.
No, no, no. It wasn't stupid.
You were right.
You were right to let Lucifer ride shotgun.
Me and Sam wouldn't have done that.
Well, it didn't work.
No, but it was our best shot, and you stepped up.
I was just trying to help.
Well, and you do help, Cass.
You know, I --
You know, sometimes me and Sam have got so much going on that... we forget about everyone else.
Well, you do live exciting lives.

You're cool with this?
'Cause, you know, last time...
Look, Chuck's dying.
Uh, no offense, God.
Yeah, no, I -- I'm dying.
So, we don't really have a choice.
I mean, look. Y-You've got darkness and light.
Y-You take one side away a-and --
It upsets the scales -- the whole balance of the universe.
Exactly. But you take both away, and now both sides of the scale are empty, so...
Of course. It's balanced.
Right. Yes. Okay.
Uh, and look.
Hey, I'm game, but how exactly are we gonna do this?
I mean, Lucifer hit her with a-a hand of God, and, well, we saw how that turned out.
: Yeah.
She does seem impossible to destroy.
Right.
Is she, Chuck?
[ Sighs ] Well, I...
I mean, well...
I...I-I --
Chuck!
Charles!
[ Sighs ] All right. Fine.
The Darkness might -- 
 have a weakness --
Light.
He tells us now.
What?
I-I just wanted to trap her.
I didn't want to murder her.
Okay, but now that we're trying to end her, how much light are we talking about?
I don't know.
10,000 suns set to supernova.
Well, y-you're God.
So, just God them up.
Look at me. I'm... not in the best shape right now.
Okay. Uh, that's all right.
Uh, we just need other ideas.
Um...
Rowena.
What about the Book of the Damned?
[ Scoffs ] This is beyond...
Okay, Crowley?
Oh, I got nothing.
Well, what about souls?
They fuel your demon deals.
Souls are living batteries.
They're full of energy. They're full of light.
Each one is as powerful as...
100 suns?
H-He's not wrong.
Okay, so if we got this kind of juice, then what?
You get me enough souls...
I can build a bomb.
Would that do the trick?
Uh... maybe.
All right. Plan B.
Okay. How many souls are we talking here?
The more the better.
Even if you could get that kind of firepower... you really think it would work?
: I can ask the angels.
Heaven is full of souls.
Okay. Uh, what else we got?
Ghosts.
Well, they're just souls with baggage, right?
Yeah, but we would need a whole lot of them.
Waverly Hills.
[ Chuckles ]
Waverly Hills Sanatorium.
Of course.
Thousands died there.
Ton of ghosts.
This is desperate... and stupid.
Well, desperate and stupid's pretty much all we got right now, so...
Fine.
I'll go raid Hell and see what's left.

Souls or no souls.
They're sealing Heaven, and they're "dying with dignity".
Well, that's awesome.
All right, Crowley. What about you?
Well, I 
 all the souls we needed.
What do you mean "had"?

Hey.
Wait a second. H-How did yo--
What are you doing here?
I saw you boys at Waverly Hills, and call me a curious kitten, but with, you know, credits about to roll, I got to ask -- why you boys busting ghosts?
Why do you care?
Dead folks -- kind of my thing.
So... spill.
We're collecting souls to build a bomb.
To blow the Darkness to hell.
Okay.
Okay?
Uh, w-what does that mean, "okay"?
Means way things are going, I'm about an hour away from reaping God himself.
So you're here to help us.
Little tip -- you want souls, call a reaper.

: Hiya.
Hello.
Oh, I like your dress.
It's pretty fancy for the park, but at least you made an effort.
Do you want to feed them?
I shouldn't.
I've been feeding these birds going on 20 years now.
They're practically family.
And I know that makes me sound like a crazy old bat, but...heck.
My husband died a couple of years ago, and my son keeps slipping me these brochures for retirement communities -- a.k.a. where they send old folks to die, but not to make a fuss about it.
So you hate him.
Well, a little bit.
Sometimes.
But you know family.
Even when you hate them, you still love them.
Well, this is exciting.

How many souls are in there?
A couple hundred...thousand.
I raided the Veil.
Like I said, dead folks -- kind of my thing.
We good?
Very.
Super.
: See you around.
Yeah. You will.
Just hope it's not today.

: So, what now?
Well, now we have the bomb, so we just got to find Amara.

Well, what are we waiting for?

We could always shove it up your --
Hey.
I mean, you could.
You won't carry the bomb.

No, I got to do this alone.

Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.
Of course.
Thank you for everything.

Well, I can't just stand by and watch the world, my friends, and my family die.
So if becoming a part of you takes me away from that, then I'm in.
You... and that bomb in your chest?
