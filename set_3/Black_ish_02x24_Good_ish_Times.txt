: 
: Babe.
[Grunts]
Ah, hey, baby.
Yeah, hey.
I've been thinking, you know, with you being pregnant, maybe you should take it easy, focus on you and my baby.
Why you keep saying "my," Dre?
You know we haven't gotten the swab back yet.
You know I do not like it when you make that joke because the subtext is you're cheating on me.
Subtext?
I... I was going to say maybe you should take some time off because you worked so hard during all of your other pregnancies.
Well, that's really sweet, but can we afford it?
We'll figure it out.
I'm pretty sure the layoffs at work are behind us.
Oh.
Well, this brings me great sadness to do this, especially since you grabbed me this delicious Egg McMuffin on your drive into work, but I really have no choice.
Lucy... we're laying you off.
What? S-Seriously?
Oh, my... oh, my God.
Okay, that was a big lie.
[Laughs]
Whew!
[Laughs]
God, you got me going.
Good one.
It, uh, it didn't bring me great sadness, but you 
 still laid off.
That part was true.
: What the hell is going on?
I thought the layoffs were over.
: Oh, no, no, no.
The tighter the ship, the bigger the profits.
Besides, Daphne really hates Lucy.
What?! We're getting our nails done together at lunch.
Well, that's gonna be awkward.
Now, turning to Charlie.
So, that's what's up?
You brought me back here so you can fire me?
You think by telling me in front of all these people, you think I ain't gonna make a scene?
All I got left is my God and my goatee!
Aaah!
Hey, Charlie!
[Grunts]
No.
Charlie.
[Grunts]
Calm down, Charlie!
Aah!
Oh, no, no, no.
Ugh.
Aaah!
Charlie, you are not fired, okay?!
I was actually gonna say good job on the Forever 21 campaign.
Actually, that was me.
Oh, that was a good job.
I've seen it everywhere.
On buses, schools. It's all over the place.
Really nice work there, Lucy.
Okay.
Well, now that that is taken care of, it is time for birthday announcements.
Oh, well, looks like we're not just celebrating Lucy's last day.

No, no, no,

Hey, baby, how was your day?
Uh, not good. I actually had to s...
Good.
Listen, you're never going to believe what happened to me at my doctor's appointment.
Dr. Gonzales told me that I have a geriatric womb.
Uh, to your face?
Told me that I'm of advanced maternal age.
To your face?!
Yes.
Oh, baby, come here.
It was awful.
Relax, baby.
Just means your wife's uterus is old.
What?
Thank you, Ruby.
Like "Antique Road Show" old.
Like probably watches "Murder, She Wrote" and has a landline 
Mama! We get it.
[Laughs]
: That's crazy.
Look at her.
She is a beautiful, vibrant, curvy, vivacious young woman.
Hey, hey, pump your brakes, Pops.
Not only is this my wife... but she is asleep.
Bow! [Claps hands]
Huh? Oh, my God.
I'm so exhausted.
Dre, m-maybe I should take that time off.
Really?
Well I think you taking some time off is a good idea, sweetheart.
And stand-up move on your part, son, letting your wife kick her feet up while you hold your family down like a man.
Mm-hmm. I agree.
Her body obviously needs rest.
Well... Look at her.
She's falling apart.
Okay.
Listen here, son.
There's a good chance I may have to carry this baby, and I'm willing to do it.
The doctors say I have the uterus of a 16-year-old Latina.
[Laughs]
Uh...
: Mmm, smells good, Grandma.
Mmm, what's on the menu?
Well, it's Ruby Tuesday, so you know what that means.
Another gravy-heavy experience.
Dad, you need to make the down payment for my summer trip abroad.
And we need new bow and arrows for "Hunger Games" camp.
We're sending them to "Hunger Games" camp?
Isn't that ex... violent?
I don't know, and I don't care.
All I know is they take them away for two weeks and I don't see them.

That's a lucky baby in that dusty womb of yours.
Oh, and don't forget my deposit for summer school.

Broke, living in the projects at my parents' house.

Hell, I'm scared, too, and, no, you ain't gonna be no nother statistic.

Damn! You ain't gonna believe what happened to me today.
You got your paycheck cut in half?

No, I found a really good parking spot in front of the building.
Man, you people have an incredibly fatalistic outlook on life.
Hey, Mrs. Evans. Hey, Michael.
Hey, what's going on?
I just left the principal's office.
Apparently, your son staged a walk-out for the school lunch monitors.
They got us down there busing tables and washing trays for cheap.
Then tell them what happened.
Julio and his cousin Julio said that they'd do our job for half the pay.

More importantly, where did this happen?
Because there is clearly only one bed in here that we all sleep in.
Okay, everything is going to be fine.
Boy, do you have the slightest idea what it means to have a child?
Did you even consider the cost?
The diapers, the formula, the medical bi... shots.
We'll skip the shots.
We skipped the shots with J.J.!
We'll need the shots. We need the shots.
We already got 82 people living in this house.
We don't need an 83rd, no matter how small.
And with our luck, it'll have Thelma's appetite... and face.
Hey, J.J, can I rap to you outside for a second?
Oh, sure.
Oh, all right.

Once Thelma gives birth to this baby...
All right, look, everybody, I will be able to take care of Thelma and the baby forever.
