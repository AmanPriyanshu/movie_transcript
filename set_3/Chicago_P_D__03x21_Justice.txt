Yeah, I shot you!
I didn't do anything!
You shot my partner!

My partner's been shot. Offender's been shot.
Sean, are you okay? Sean!
Are you hit anywhere else?
Sean, please talk to me!
Just show me!
Please don't die! Please don't die!
Sean!
How many shots?
Four? Maybe five.
And then Roman, he screams at me to go.
He said that?
Yes.
So I chased that little prick to that corner, he fires at me two more times.
I tell him to stop and then he turns, looks over his shoulder, something silver in his hand, so I fired.
You kept sight on him the whole time?
No, not when he rounded the corner.
But I only had my eye off him for a few seconds, it's the same kid.
You get a look at him as he approached the car?
Maybe a glimpse. Mostly just arm and torso, gun and muzzle flashes.
Silver gun, it looked like a .9.
Did you see where the asswipe tossed the piece?
What?
Can't find it.
You all right?
Yes. How is Sean?
He lost a lot of blood.
Marine Unit is en route to find the gun.
You hit him twice from 40 yards away in low light? Nice job.

Okay? List everything that happened.

We're running their address for any historical in-service calls.
Roman and Ellis are both in surgery at Med.
Ellis' parents are there.
You got surveillance footage?
Yeah.

It's unreal.
Just like Philadelphia.

That's right.
And Officer Burgess? How's she holding up?
As well as can be expected.
What kind of a cop is she?
A plus.
I'm gonna need the General Progress Reports from the incident... plus any CRs on both Officers Roman and Burgess.
They're active cops, they're gonna have complaint reports.
Yeah, I get it.
We have 42 hours to either charge or release Mr. Ellis.
Yeah, I'm aware.
Feed you the info as I get it.
I appreciate that, but because of the profile of the incident, we'll be doing a parallel and independent investigation.
My people are already talking to the victim.
This is a clean shoot, Peter.
I sure hope so.
You get me those reports ASAP.
Mr. and Mrs. Ellis?
I'm Detective Halstead, this is Detective Lindsay.
They're saying Michael shot the police.
Yeah, he did.
That couldn't happen. It just couldn't.
That's what we're here to figure out.
Does your son have access to a gun?
No! No knife, no gun, no nothing.
Not in my house.
You have to believe us.
Michael doesn't have a mean bone in his body.
He's a Chicago Scholar. He's on the Honor Roll.
There's no way he could've done this.
My son didn't do this! [crying]

I know you and I ended pretty rough, but, hey...
I still care about you a lot and... if you need anything at all...
I'm here. I got your back.
Okay?
Tell us what happened, Michael.
This guy ran around a corner.
Fired a gun a couple of times then ducked off into a building like 20 feet from me.
I started to run 'cause this kid was shooting and I didn't know what was going on.
Next thing I know, I hear this woman's voice yelling so I turned and ran.
Then it felt like I got punched hard in the back.
That's all I remember.
Now they telling me I might never walk again.
[whispers] Oh, God.
[crying] My baby.
Michael, did you have a gun?
No.
What were you doing down by the water?
I was just going for a walk.
This girl I've been seeing, she broke up with me.
I just wanted to be alone.
That lady cop... shot the wrong guy.
We finished the IPR, separated by family members, known associates, neighbors, and schools.
We did not find one witness who would say this kid was anything but an Eagle Scout.
Gang Investigation says they don't have him affiliated with anyone.
Not one gang card or disbursal on him.
Gunshot residue test on Ellis came back inconclusive, because of the water he fell into.
[phone rings]
Patel. Yes, sir.
Okay.
Boss needs an update.
He's on his way.
No weapon.
No continuous line of sight.
No independent witnesses to any part of it.
What do we have?
Officer Burgess.
We actually have more evidence against her than Ellis.
She made a positive ID.
The single most unreliable type of ID, eyewitnesses.
Oh, come on, we all know what happened that night.
The other guy Ellis said was shooting?
He's not on any cameras.
And the building he supposedly ran into?
One door, triple locked from the inside.
Houdini couldn't have gotten in.
No gun. Shot in the back.
You rush to edict this kid and we get it wrong...
This city's gonna explode.
You know what I can't figure out?
Is why Ellis did it.
It doesn't add up.
How do you graduate from having no priors to trying to kill two cops?
We may never know.
I need to know.
'Cause until I do, there's too many cracks in the case to bring charges.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.
Michael Ellis is free to go home once he's discharged from Med.
You're making a mistake.
We're gonna keep investigating.
Don't blow smoke up my ass. You caved.
This case is gonna get shoved in a file cabinet somewhere.
That's where you're wrong.
Someone's getting charged.
I just don't know who yet.

Yes, it's a stainless steel Beretta 92.

I did. The fired evidence from the crime scene came from this gun.
So this gun, found in the river, is the same gun that shot Officer Roman?
Correct.
Hmm.
Can you determine from this photo, People's exhibit 11, the make of the gun Michael Ellis is holding here?
That is stainless steel Beretta 92.
A stainless steel Beretta 92.

Bottom line is that kid shot at my friends.
Might as well have shot me.
But why did he?
I can put him at the scene.
I can put the gun in his hand and that's enough, but I still don't get why.
'Cause I look in Ellis' eyes and I see what the jury sees: someone's son.
Not an attempted cop killer.
What is it?
I think we got motive.
Location of the incident is five miles away from Ellis' house.
If he liked walking by the river or lake so much, why would he come here?
The south branch is less than four blocks from his house.
Ellis had a wallet the night he was shot which was inventoried. Inside there was a CTA pass which he didn't use the night of the shooting, so we couldn't build a time line of where he was prior to the incident.
Then we ran his CTA card for historical information.
Lo and behold Ellis visited that same location of the shooting 16 times over the last four years.
So we ran everyone that was arrested in the area and then we ran victims.
Could you just tell us what you found, please?
Dewan Motley.
Who's Dewan Motley?

He was a live-in boyfriend of one of Ellis' aunts.
Basically, a whole lot went down between Dewan Motley and the CPD at this exact same location six years ago.
