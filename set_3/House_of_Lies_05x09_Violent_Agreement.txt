 doesn't win the offer first.
Correct.
We're gonna blow her right out of the water.
We screw people over all the time, but if we're just gonna hand the whole thing over to Skip Galweather, what's the point?
The point is money, Jeannie.
Skip just called, and the Kohl brothers are going with Monica.
Until they sign on that dotted line, we can still win this thing.
You still have a connection in Cuba, right?
I don't know if Cuba's ready for the Kohl brothers.
Let's make 'em ready.

You're creeping me out. What's up?
Seth Buckley is leading the polls, and by extension...
Your pen1s?
My pen1s.
What a shock.
Slapping around that boy band has turned Seth into a social media sensation.
[chuckles]
Can I give you a little word of advice, Clyde?
I really came in here to gloat. I don't care about your advice.
Proceed with caution, my friend.
Okay.
Social media can be a fickle mistress.
Mm-hmm.
One minute, you're being called the King of the TED Talk, and the next, VagBreath69 is telling you to "choke on a druid's cock."
This is the exact type of break we needed.
See, people are taking a closer look at him.
Seth Buckley is going to be the new mayor.
And VagBreath69 is going to be his chief economic advisor.
f*cking knew it was you. Marty!
Clyde's been saying mean things about me on social media again.
I have.
Aw.
Isn't this nice?
Couple of co-workers just easing into their morning.
Yeah.
Maybe reading an online article or two.
Sippin' a nice cup of joe.
You know what? I've actually recently switched to tea, and I got to say, digestively speaking...
Pretty certain we're about to get yelled at, Douglas.
: What the f*ck is wrong with you guys?
Should I move away from you?
If you cherish your life.
Yeah.
Of course. I apologize.
Why haven't I gotten the PowerPoint on the f*cking Cuba pitch?
I e-mailed it to you yesterday.
Well, I haven't gotten it.
'Cause the Internet in this building is f*cked.
Doug...
I-I'm on it, Marty.
I've e-mailed I. T. a bunch of times, I haven't heard anything...
E-mailed. [chuckles]
Where's my head? I'll call them.
In the meantime, I guess, I'll just go sit in my office in front of the computer and wait for the thing.
All right. We'll be in touch.
Wow, you don't see it coming again?
: Or you dickheads could pitch it to me right the f*ck now!
Cuba strategy for the Kohl brothers.
Let me hear it.
With the trade ban lifted, demand for hotel inventory is about to shoot through the motherfucking roof.
That's 1.5 million American visitors per year, trying to fit into 60, 000 hotel rooms.
Yeah, resort development is the tip of the spear.
Okay? If they can establish a foothold in Cuba, the Kohl brothers can extend their tentacles into many arenas, such as...
Agriculture, energy, polymers and paper.
: A vast, untamed frontier, just off the coast of Florida.
Kohl brothers are gonna eat this sh1t up.
Now, the tricky part is gonna be navigating Cuban bureaucracy, but Ron Zobel's got that covered, right?
He better.
[ringtone playing]
Hey.
So guess who called in sick again?
f*cking nanny.
[coughs]
"Oh, I don't want to get Phoebe sick."
No, she went with stomach flu.
Is that Jeannie? Hello, Jeannie.
: Yeah, Ron Zobel says hi.
So I checked around and I got no hits on a replacement sitter.
I think I'm just gonna take a mommy-daughter day.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Uh, give Phoebe a kiss for me, okay?
You do the same with Ron Zobel.
Ron. Just the man I was looking for.
Oh, you want me to double my output of PSLs?
PSLs?
Pumpkin spice lattes.
[chuckles] No.
Uh, I'm good there.
Listen, I was wondering about your Cuba contact.
Mm-hmm.
Has he been able to arrange a sit-down?
Yeah, one second, because, you know, this requires focus, and you do not want to over-cinnamon, Martin.
God, no.
So, Ron?
Yeah, Orozco and I have already had our preliminary discussions.
Man, you really need to taste this.
I don't want a f*cking latte.
Because if you've only ever had the kind from Starbucks, man... [chuckles]
Ron, just how preliminary have these discussions been?
Yeah. I have not broached the topic of K and A's interest in Cuba.
Great.
I mean, no sweat.
Not like there's a ticking clock on this f*cking thing.
Listen, I know you're looking to get Skip's dick hard about Cuba ASAP.
But listen to me, I have put major time and resources into cultivating Orozco, predating my employment here.
You hedgey m*therf*cker.
Come on. I mean, obviously, I know it'll be a huge win if we can parlay Cuba into an offer from the Kohls to buy K and A.
Yeah. Because you'd be sitting in the captain's chair, right?
If the sale goes through.
But if not, I need some guarantee.
Um, how about I guarantee I will stomp a mud hole in your ass if you don't get this guy on the phone right f*cking now.
Is that the kind of guarantee you're looking for, Ron?
I was thinking more like a larger equity piece.
I f*cking swear...
You know I've been a good soldier.
Okay? And I've eaten a lot of sh1t from you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But don't confuse me with being a patsy.

Cuba moves forward on my terms or not at all.

I know that your guys are all about untapped markets.
Hey, Marty, did you ever watch

Man, I loved that show.
There was this one episode where this Japanese sailor gets washed up onshore.
He was played by this white actor. [chuckles]
Coke-bottle glasses and "ching chong" accent.
Oh.
Super racist.
Yeah, hilarious.
Uh, well, anyway, he imprisons the castaways because, get this, he still thinks it's World War Two.

It's 1965; the war's been over for 20 years!
Nobody told the guy. Yeah.
Nobody told the guy.
Take off the Coke-bottle glasses, Hirohito.
War's over.
You lost, move on.
When the Kohl brothers hear what I have to pitch, they're gonna be all over it.
No, no, no, no.
You're not quite getting it. I'm gonna speak slowly.
This was never a real competition.
So whatever "Hail Marty" you're planning on throwing, don't bother, because it won't change a goddamn thing.
Why? Because I've got my thumb... boom... on the scale, and... I don't want you to win.
So all that sweet talking you were doing at the beginning, that was just bullshit?
Well, no.
But then you actually started to want it, and I couldn't resist picking up that football.
I'm Charlie Brown? I'm Charlie Brown?
Ah, yeah. Ha, ha, ha.
Okay, well, it's always a pleasure to see you, Skip.
I will send you a box of cigars when I am building hotels with Marriott in Cuba.
Wait, what?
"Wait, what?"
Huh? That got your f*cking attention, didn't it?
That's right, Uncle Marty has a plan that is gonna make the Kohl brothers' 
 wet dream a reality.
Holy sh1t.
Cuba, that's, like, a billion-dollar opportunity.
I serve that up to the Kohls, they'll lift me up on my back and parade me through the streets!
Viva la Galweather, baby!
Monica already brought us Cuba this morning, slowpoke.
Oh, sh1t, did I yank away that football again?
She's actually got a very smart plan, centering around resort development.
Once they have established a toehold in Cuba, the Kohl brothers can spread their many tentacles into other arenas.

What? Why?
Because I said so, Edgar.

I didn't, uh, think you'd be here.
I thought you were eating out today, JR.
No? Good. Great.
Great, great, great to see you.
[clears throat] This is JR, my office mate, my pal, my mentee.
Not your mentee, Doug.
: Well, doesn't matter.
Uh, JR, this is my cousin Edgar.
Um, Edgar grew up a couple towns over from me.
Spent our formative years together.
Even lost our virginity to the same girl.

What was her name again?
I don't remember.

You don't remember.
Classic Edgar.

Yeah. Oh, God, listen to him.
Straight off the plane, already has to check Facebook.

Sorry.
All right.
Nice meeting you.
You don't remember her name?
Get your head in the game, Edgar.

Okay, I like where your head's at.
[laughs] Oh.
[humming]
Guys. Guys.
: Yeah.
What the f*ck are you doing?
Oh, yeah, what are we doing?
It seems that Ron hedged his bets and gave Monica our plan on Cuba.
So we are taking the measured response of trashing his office before we do the very same to him.
[chatters excitedly]
Marty, that... that doesn't make any sense.
Jeannie, if you're gonna try to stop us, you should keep in mind it is twice as much fun as it looks.
[chatters excitedly]
: Marty, Marty.
Marty, Ron gave you the keys to Cuba, right?
So... why would he do that if he's just gonna turn around and give them to Monica?
I do not f*cking know, Jeannie.
But what I know is that Skip f*cking Galweather had details about Monica's plan that matched ours exactly.
So if you don't mind...
Ha!
No, no, no, no!
God.
Um...
Okay, look, I don't know if any of you heard that my cousin Edgar is visiting from out of town.
Truth is...
...he's not really my cousin.
Yeah, I know that, Doug.
Well, sure, now that I told you.
Are you serious? No.
Hey, Doug?
I think I might know how Monica figured out our plan.
Okay, your server was definitely compromised.
: Jesus, Doug.
Of all the ways you could have f*cked over this company...
This is by far the least surprising.
Hey, let's not forget who brought Monica into our lives in the first place.
I mean, f*cking Monica, right?
So I'll run AMP to remove the malicious files.
No, no, wait, hold on, don't... don't do anything.
Just, um, leave it in place for now.
Monica can still read our e-mails.
Correct.
Which is something you could use to your advantage since she doesn't know you know.
Would you ever consider coming to work here, Bruce?
I mean, we're gonna have an opening soon.
[laughs nervously] No, we're not.
He's joking. He's kidding.
No, I-I... I understand how difficult it was for you to wrangle this meeting, and I-I appreciate it, but I'm not gonna call...
I'm not gonna say it. Um...
[quietly] You're the magic man.
Okay? Yep, there you go.
Bye-bye.
[phone beeps]
Um, was that the magic man?
Seems that Ron was able to get us five minutes with the Kohl brothers.
What did you have to give up?
You haven't grown too attached to Phoebe, have you?
For five minutes with the Kohls? Phoebe who?
Right?
[door opens]
Oh, hey, Dad. Hey, Jeannie.
What was that?
What was what?
[laughing] Okay, y'all were watching some p0rn. Okay.
You were supposed to be home an hour ago, you realize that?
You know what, go do your homework, okay?
Go on.
I'll go do my homework.
: Good night, Roscoe.
You got it, Mr. Kaan.
I got you. Good night, Jeannie.
Good, good.
It did not come off insanely paranoid.
Listen, Monica hacked into our server, okay?
You think she's above pumping her own kid for some insider information?
[Jeannie scoffs]
Phoebe and I had a pretty interesting day.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
We went to the park.
And we saw this old man, who was, uh, in this amazing suit.
Like, a pin-striped.
Like, Yves Saint Laurent.
I don't know, I felt like he must have been, uh, a dynamo in '73.
[Marty chuckles]
And he... it was like he got all dressed up to go to work, and there was just no work to go to, so he... he sat down and fed the pigeons.
It's actually kind of sad.
Not for the pigeons.
[imitates rim shot]
Not for the pigeons.
[laughs] Jeannie, we're not 83.
I know.
And if it gets to the point where, you know, we're buying birdseed...
Obviously, it's not gonna get to the point where we're buying birdseed, but I just... you know, we've never had that kind of time before.
We get bored, we'll just go back to work.
Is that what you're planning on doing?
Because I thought the whole point was that-that... that we're not supposed to jump right back in.
Okay, then we don't.
That...
Okay. Great.
Great.
So when would we be going?
And how long will we be there?
[scoffs] It's supposed to rain early next week; should I be packing an umbrella?
I don't know, Douglas.
If it rains, you can always buy an umbrella in Cuba.
Can I? Uh, it's a communist country.
Are umbrellas even available?
You know I can't think when I'm wet.
By the way, if you guys are going this week, I will be joining late.
Campaign has a lot of big meetings about the shape of the administration, and Seth is gonna want my input.
Oh, well, if you're not going, maybe we should just skip the whole Cuba thing.
Yeah, you know what?
Let's just cancel the Kohl brothers meeting, too.
Actually, Marty, you better call Monica, tell her we surrender.
You know what, f*ck, before I forget.
'Cause we have to be so careful about our e-mail and everything, I want to deliver this the old-fashioned way.
Douglas, for you.
Oh, my God, is that a snatch alert?
[chuckles] Very funny, Clyde.
Very funny.
Mm.
Boy, you really want to open that thing, don't you?
Huh?
What is wrong with you?
I'm not saying it definitely is, but there's a possibility that is an actual snatch alert.
[elevator bell dings]
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna put this exactly where it belongs.
Right here in the, uh... in the trash there.
Right there, yeah.
Okay... Oh. You know what?
I'll, um, I'll meet you downstairs. I forgot to...
Your snatch alert?
Uh, oh, no, no, no!
[grunts]
Last meeting didn't go as expected?
: When I was eight and Sean was nine, our father locked us in our room.
Told us there was only one candy bar.
Said whichever one of us was still standing in an hour got it.
What kind of candy bar? Doesn't matter.
We did that every night for a year.
[chuckles] That's a lot of candy.
Stop talking, Doug.
: Humans are animals.
World is a jungle.
Our father wanted us to understand that.
We're not sitting here today if not for him.
Great man.
Oh, yeah.
Great man.
You can tell from that story that he sounds cool.
What's he up to?
We're vigilant about not forgetting that lesson.
That's why you still beat the sh1t out of each other.
It's always nice to hold on to a piece of your childhood.
Are we done bullshitting?
Thought we were talking about Cuba.
We are. May we?

Now, we understand that Monica Talbot made you a lot of big promises, but she doesn't have what we have.
An actual Cuban contact.
Excuse me.

Am I interrupting?
Marty, did you think I wasn't gonna find out? What is this?
A little end-around?
Little League. Excuse me.
I'm so sorry. I apologize.
I told him it was over.
Did you tell them why?
You know, why you insisted on them spending $100 million dollars to buy Talbot &amp; Company as opposed to us?
You didn't tell them?
That's fine. I'll take care of it, Skipper.
You see, Skip thinks I'm an asshole.
And Skip is right. He is.
Playing with other people's money just to pursue a personal vendetta?
It's not cool, Skip.
: Ain't cool, Skip.
You see, he doesn't really believe that Monica is the smarter play.
He's just upset because, a long time ago, I hurt his little feelings.
[chuckles] I chose Monica...
You're a f*cking pussy.
That's the word, yes.
I've been saying that for years, thank you.
I am not a pussy.
Look, I don't give a sh1t about you.
And I don't give a sh1t about the skinny girl with the whisper voice.
[whispers] That's Monica.
: I do give a sh1t about Cuba.
Our grandfather had substantial holdings there.
All repatriated after the revolution.
