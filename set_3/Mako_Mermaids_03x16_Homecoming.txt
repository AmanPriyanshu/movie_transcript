Ms. Chadwick?
Ms. Chadwick?
We're almost done.
I'll need to pack that now.
Of course.
This one's always been my favorite.
I'm certain it has a fascinating history.
: There must be something the pod can do about the dragon.
: I've seen what this creature can do.
Without the Jiao Long bracelet, I don't like their chances.
You don't have to worry about the dragon.
It's gone?
The mermaid council just announced its plan.
When the moon rises, they will enter the moon pool and unleash the full power of Mako.
 No more dragon.
Just like that?
They seem pretty sure it'll work.
So where's Mimmi?
She needed some time alone.
How come?
I heard about Chris.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
It's probably for the best.
There's my big, tough sis.
Why's it doing that?
It's her.
 My children.
You saw her... right?
What's going on?
I have no idea.
This time...
Ah, Weilan.
Always a delight to see you.
Problem?
Okay, we have tea and talk.
I need a break from tinkering with this most stubborn mechanism.
What's wrong with it?
Ah, wound up too tight... like you.
It would take a magician to make it work.
You put up the painting.
: Ah, yes. Look nice.
Also, got new stock in. Many bargains.
You don't have anything that can kill a dragon, do you?
 Kill a dragon?
Like in the Jiao Long legend.
That's not what happened in the legend.
But you said--
No.
The dragon was not killed.
: 
: 
As close as you are now, and she spoke to us.
But Weilan said Nerissa was--
Weilan only said that Nerissa disappeared.
No one knows for certain what happened to her.
I am sure that she was trying to communicate with us.
Why would she do that?
What if the dragon didn't kill her?
: What?
What if our mother is alive and reaching out to us?
What if she needs our help?
Now, hang on--
Mimmi might be right.
A long time ago, a Chinese mermaid fell in love with a land boy.
Another pod heard about it and decided to punish the mermaid and the pod for letting it happen.
So, guess what?
They turned the land boy into a water dragon.
The Jiao Long Dragon.
: Now, here's the good bit.
The mermaid used a bracelet to break the spell and free the land boy.
Does anybody see where I'm going with this or do I have to draw diagrams?
What if our mother is under the same kind of powerful spell?
And what if the bracelet could free her?
Guys, come on.
The dragon is a serious threat.
It took Evie's tail.
It could have taken my tail, and Mimmi's, but it didn't.
After what we saw this morning, I'm sure our mother is calling to us.
She needs our help.
We should talk to Veridia.
Do you think it could be true?
It's the only thing that makes sense of everything that's happened.
We need to get that bracelet.
Now, why didn't I think of that?
: Well, the books seem to have sold well.
Very well, Ms. Chadwick.
I think the tour's going to be a great success.
I'll call a taxi to take us back to the hotel.
I'll meet you there. There's something I need to do first.
: Veridia, please?
We know what we saw.
I understand that you want your mother back, but you have no proof that she is alive.
We both saw her. She spoke to us.
I have no doubt that you think you saw something--
We did see her! She's alive!
You need to give us the chance to save her!
I have the welfare of the pod to consider.
We are part of the pod, too.
I'm sorry... but the risk is too great.
We must destroy the dragon or we will never be safe.
Yes, I'm ready now. I'll be waiting outside.
What happened to all the stuff?
I'm sorry, but it's all been packed away.
Where's Ms. Chadwick?
She's just left.
Where did she go?
She didn't say.
If you want her book, you can buy it online.
Good afternoon.
We need to find her.
There can't be too many places where a rich, famous, underwater explorer would hang out.
That's not all she is.
Meaning?
 Where would a mermaid hang out?
We can't let them do this.
The council's decision is final.
 I'm sorry.
But she's our mother.
I know this is hard for you to accept... but what if the council is right and the dragon is just a dragon?
But what if they're wrong?
: We thought we'd find you here.
You should really do something with this place.
It hasn't changed at all since I was last here.
We like it this way.
Suit yourselves.
This is where it all began for you, isn't it?
This is where you became a mermaid.
I was here with two friends... under the full moon.
It must have been quite a surprise.
Surprise?
One day, you're a normal teenage girl, and the next, you're... this.
Was it really that bad?
First dive over Mako reef was amazing... like all the best feelings in the world all rolled into one.
We felt so special.
Then everything becomes about keeping the secret.
And you don't know who to trust, so you don't trust anyone.
It was us three versus the world.
What happened to your friends?
We grew up.
Found other interests.
Even mermaids move on.
You miss them... don't you?
Mermaids share a secret that bind us together.
When you were swimming on the reef with your friends, didn't you feel like you were sisters?
Think how bad you felt when you lost your friends.
Imagine how bad it would feel to lose a hundred sisters.
You came here because you were drawn here.
 Don't you see?
You're just like us... a Mako mermaid.
Let us have the bracelet.
Please?
Everything I find, I donate to the foundation.
It would take days of filling out forms if I asked to take the bracelet.
So... why bother asking?
: Careful. It's fragile.
And that, too.
 It's in that blue box.
: Take care.
Turn that off, now!
Hurry up!
What is going on?
: I don't know.
: Ah, this is ridiculous! Will you please open the door?
: Oh, thank you.
You have to teach me how to do that.
Careful with that.
Thank you.
Good luck.
: Yes, that, too, and careful.
There has to be some other kind of magic that can break the spell.
Even if there is, we don't have time to find it.
We have to get that bracelet.
You mean, this bracelet?
Any idea how it works?
The Jiao Long painting didn't show instructions.
Who's going to use it?
I got pretty close to the dragon last time.
It has to be a mermaid.
Go for it.
No!
We'll stop this!
Now, Mimmi!
She's here!
I can feel her!
I can feel her, too!
Zac and Mimmi are out there with the dragon.
You have to stop this.
Give them a chance to save their mother.
Please!
It is too late.
It is beyond our control!
Mother!
Mother!
Come back!
Mimmi!
: Mimmi!
: Mimmi!
: Mimmi!
Mimmi!
 Mimmi!
: Mimmi!
My children.
: When the battle with the Eastern Pod turned against Aurora, she used a spell to turn me into the dragon.
Then she made me attack Weilan's pod.
I can't tell you how awful that was.
After the Eastern Pod were defeated, I lay in a deep sleep.
As the years passed...
I dreamed that my children had found each other.
Rita always thought there was a reason we were left so close together.
Me on Mako, and Zac on land.
Once you found each other, your connection, your love, touched me... and began to lift the spell.
It took a long time, but one day, I came awake, and then I saw Weilan.
See?
You did bring the dragon.
And you just love being right.
Mmm-hmm. 
Many years ago, I left you here... not knowing if I would ever see you again.
It was the hardest thing I have ever done.
I will never leave you again.
So you're telling us that last night there was a massive, magical storm, this bracelet destroyed the dragon, and no one took any photos?
Cam!
It's a beautiful story.
You must be so happy to have your mother back.
I'm still having trouble believing it.
Bring her in for a meal anytime. On the house.
You know what the really weird thing is?
I now have two mothers.
Are you going to tell your parents about Nerissa?
I think I will.
They took me in and gave me everything.
They deserve to know where I came from and... who I really am.
I think they'll be good with that.
Hello?
Huh!
 Magic.
You want to know my secret?
I can't believe Veridia gave you a moon ring.
I think it suits me.
I suppose you'll be wanting lessons?
Know any good teachers?
I guess the bracelet worked.
I'll never be able to thank you enough.
What made you change your mind?
You have very persuasive friends.
No, you keep it.
I'll enjoy watching Mr. Singh figure out where it went.
Will you come back one day and meet our pod?
I wouldn't miss it.
Plus, I think I've got some friends who might be interested.
Mako is their home, too.
Speaking of pods, I was thinking I might go back to Shanghai.
Start the Eastern Pod again.
Would you like some company?
You're leaving Mako?
Not forever.
Besides, I could never leave you on your own.
Who'd keep you out of trouble?
You and Zac will be getting to know Nerissa.
And I was thinking that I could learn to cook some real Chinese food.
Not those awful Pot Noodles you make, though.
You? Learn to cook anything edible? I don't think so.
: Aw, give the girl a break.
: Yeah. My cooking's not that bad.
: You're right, it's not bad. It's terrible.
 
: Hey!
