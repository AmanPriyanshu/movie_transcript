I'm offering to lead the Royal forces to victory, and he treats me like a common spy!!
I only told you about Andrea because it seemed clear that your country has betrayed you!!
It is my great honor to welcome you to this army.
Thank you, sir.
I'll be needing the intelligence from your man in the city.
You can't talk to Townsend!
I can find out everything you need to know about that woman, about Andrea...
(dull thud)
Who robbed you?
It was Robert Rodgers.
Which way did he run?
: 
Keep it there.
(groans)
You didn't provoke them?
Provoke them?
(chuckles)
I was readying for bed.
They rode in out of the night.
Identified themselves as Queen's Rangers.
And then immediately set to wreaking as much havoc as they could.
(whinnies)
(horse screaming)
(grunts)
I suppose things could have been worse than a few bruised ribs.
And broken pride.
The Queen's Rangers are not known for their delicate touch, Father.
You stood your ground.
But if there is a next time...
What is that?
I would have thought that obvious.
I bought it on York Island.
The spirit of Christ will never move us to war against any man with outward weapons.
They attacked you.
And we cannot let them taint us.
The Society of Friends do not harbor arms.
Now take that away.
You are right, Father.
I will not need outward weapons.
What was it that Woodhull said?
I need only my eyes, my ears, my wits.
So you've chosen a side?
No, no, they chose for me when they came into this house and dealt violence.
God as my witness, they will pay.
I said not to hurt the old man.
The whole regiment is searching, Captain, but we're spread thin.
Are we sure Rogers is moving west?
After he robbed me, he ran off west.
He can't have gotten far.
He was wounded and blind in one eye.
I know, I blinded him.
Falkoff, push towards the coastline, then cut up to your perimeter.
Rogers dies today.
(twigs snap)
(footsteps)
Set their hounds to me, did you, farmer?
(grunts)
(muffled shouting)
Shh!
Take a circle till you come to your own tracks.
You forgot my rules, Eldridge.
(chatter)
There must be some way.
I bet Martha could spot the telltale.
André's forger was very good.
The paper is ours. The printing is an exact duplicate.
And there were 12 crews to disperse it.
Well, 11 after we stopped Lieutenant Gamble at Moodna Creek.
Yes, and André managed to slip a considerable sum past our lines, which is why we must now travel to Philadelphia.
To... to Philadelphia?
And you're going with me.
Since there's no telling how many counterfeit bills are already in use, 
And he needs you to testify the same.
Sir, you want Congress to declare bankruptcy?
To save itself, yes.
I suppose it can't be helped.
But it could have been avoided.
Culper Jr. obtained his intelligence nearly a week before we could act upon it.
But, sir, the route is secure.
It's circuitous.
It's as fast as we can make it.
Culper Jr. passes his gains along to his father in Oyster Bay.
And that same day, Culper Sr. picks it up and prepares it for the dead drop in Setauket.
Why not send Lieutenant Brewster direct to Oyster Bay, 
But that would cut Culper out of the chain.
And reduce the transfer time by half.
Many mickles make a muckle.
The little things add up.
He's been dead for hours.
Does appear that he is heading west, though.
So shall we.
Rogers isn't the only man who can hunt.
He'll stay off the main road, likely use the coastline as a guide.
But he won't survive without provisions and rest.
We'll scour this island, clear every mud hut standing till we find our notorious Mr. Culper.
Woodhull, you may return home.
(clicks tongue)
(horses neigh)
Hyah!
: 
The commander thinks that the ring is moving too slowly and, frankly, he's right.
Washington wants Culper out.
I need you to make contact with Samuel Townsend.
Let him know that from now on, he'll be dealing directly with you.
Right, that's going to be a problem.
I know. It's not personal against Culper.
It's a strategic decision.
Yeah, I know. I can't do it.
Caleb, I need to leave for Philadelphia.
I can't debate with you.
Samuel Townsend cannot see my face.
What?
Come on, the two of you.
Oh, this can't be good.
Right, so a couple of months back when I went to New York to get Abe out of prison... that stubborn little b*st*rd refused to go, right?
No, wait!
Said he recruited a man in New York.
Look, there is still a chance.
Townsend?
Right. Except he hadn't.
You see, Culper Jr. was still on the fence.
So I met him at his old boardinghouse.
But he didn't trust me and he sure as shite didn't trust Abe.
Then why would he risk his life to warn us of the Hickey plot?
Because after I left, we gave him a push.
Abe knew the Quaker needed convincing, right?
So he had me scoop up some Connecticut lads, row out to Oyster Bay, play like we were Queen's Rangers, and ransack the old man's place.
Only it got out of hand.
(groaning)
It was Woody's idea. It wasn't mine.
But it worked, right?
Oh, my God.
And if he finds out the truth, he'll quit.
Yeah. Well... yeah.
And this was Abe's idea?
To do that to Townsend?
Yeah, he's definitely out.
Come on.
It ain't as bad as what we did to him.
Hmm? Throwing him into a cell.
Putting the fear into him.
Oh, God.
Yeah, it's probably where he got the idea.
Ben.
I can't go to Washington with this.
I agree.
Ben.
Oh, you agree, do you? That's wonderful.
So what do you think we should do?
Ben, send me.
What?
He hasn't seen my face.
Send me.
(sighs)
And if you have reservations about that, comfort yourself with the fact that this man has left you no choice.
Hey, that's...
(clears throat)
(birds chirping)
"Nor can we find the necessity"...
What was that last part, my love?
André writes, "We are thankful for the information transmitted and hope that you will continue," but to allow him "to prescribe a little more exertion."
He wants details about Washington's camp.
He wants a map of the batteries at West Point.
Does Washington not ride for Philadelphia as we speak?
Perhaps you can... -
These will not be the terms of my defection.
I am a general.
He wants what?
Bountiful monetary compensation and property indemnified from any loss should he be discovered.
Ridiculous.
We have to give this man something if only to show good faith.
You have to see things from his side.
His side? And what is his risk? Nothing.
If I am to stay this course, then I need to know that my demands will be met.
He wants a battlefield command.
Concern yourself with what I want, John... details on Washington's camps, status of all rebel ships on the Hudson, confirmation...
Regarding the identity of the spy named Culper.
I don't know any Culper. Intelligence is Tallmadge's business.
Well, you know him. It wouldn't be too hard to inquire.
And why should I exert myself for André when he has done nothing for me?
Because if you don't, this won't move any further.
Too thick a stone wall and Arnold won't...
Why should I guarantee him a command before he's done anything to earn it?
Because you opened this line of communication.
Major André...
I don't trust him.
I don't care how many times he ate at your father's table.
Or how well acquainted you are with her sheets.
Arnold will give us what we want or he will remain with these rebels.
And when they are defeated, he will be branded alongside Washington as one of history's greatest traitors.
"Sums must be held until a generous effort has been made."
A generous effort?
What are you doing?
I don't know, Peggy.
I don't know anymore.
Yes, you do.
Benedict, you appealed to Washington and he betrayed you.
No.
He suggested that I apply for a court-martial to clear my name.
It was Joseph Reed who manipulated the postponement of the trial and I let...
I let my anger cloud my judgment.
No, my love.
Your anger is justified. You are in the right.
Yes.
Yes, and when I prove that and when I clear my name once and for all, I won't even need the British.
As you said, Washington is coming.
That's the key. He has the power to overrule this postponement.
But he is riding here to meet with Reed and the rest of Congress.
Yes, and before he does so, he will be obliged to attend a party in his honor here.
And that is when I will convince him, man-to-man.
(chatter)
: 
 so just mind things while I'm away.
If they want to buy something, check the price and take their money.
I won't be gone long.
Just headed home for the Thanksgiving Day.
(bird warbling)
Abraham.
Oh, how wonderful!
How wonderful you've decided to accept my invitation after all.
Did you bring the family?
Oh, I made extra just in case. All right, well...
Come in. (chuckles)
(sighs)
You're gonna have to leave.
Leave?
Yeah, the Queen's Rangers are moving down Long Island again.
We're gonna have to go right now.
: 
Better safe than sorry.
You're going to go stay with Robert for a while, all right?
Robert might already be on his way here.
Well, then I can stay here until he shows.
Why don't we wait until he arrives and then we can all go together, hmm?
(sighs)
(bird screeching)
You burned it down?
Look, we did what we needed to do, all right?
Well, now it's my turn.
(breathes deeply) Stay hidden.
Yes, ma'am.
Abraham. Abraham.
I appreciate your caution...
(whispering) Does Robert have a key?
(rattles)
Evening.
Are you Samuel Townsend?
Yes.
I am a friend of your son's.
Would you mind if I come in? It's quite brisk.
Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.
: 
: 
I know this is a bit unorthodox.
It's all right. It's all right.
Abraham is also a friend of my son's.
Of course I wouldn't expect the two of you to know each other.
We do.
We do.
Mr. Townsend, my name is Anna Strong and I have come from General Washington's camp in Middle Brook.
And now you have to go.
No, I'm afraid you'll have to.
: 
:
No, it can't.
Will you give us a moment?
How did you even get here?
How do you think? Brewster.
Don't worry, he's been ordered to stay out of sight.
Your secret's safe. But Ben knows.
And it's another reason you're being cut out.
(whispering) Cut out? Cut me out?
I'm... I'm General Washington's man on Long Island.
Now, look, if this has anything to do with what has happened between us...
No, this isn't about that.
This is an order from Washington.
Letters take too long to reach him and we've already suffered because of it.
Accept it, Abe. You're out.
Mr. Townsend, as I was saying, I have come directly from Washington's camp and Mr. Woodhull can verify that.
 to be transmitted by a more direct route.
I will be the new courier.
You?
Mmm.
(scoffs)
This is all very confusing.
It does seem so, doesn't it?
First Abraham, then Austin Roe, and now a woman?
Who's Austin Roe?
(scoffs)
(panting)
(panting continues)
(music playing)
(laughing)
Oh, poor Neddy dreads the postnuptials.
He's convinced he'll lose his nerve on the big night.
Why wait until then? Just get it over with.
My husband purchased four ounces of Spanish fly for our first night.
Right before the thing fell off.
(laughing)
You'll have to excuse Becky.
She's drunk.
Welcome to Penn Mansion.
A pleasure to be here.
So kind of you to have us.
Pardon me.
I see you received our invitation.
On the road, in fact.
Thank you for welcoming me into your home.
Of course. Your Excellency, 
I believe I am acquainted with Miss Shippen, but it cannot be that this exquisite young woman is the same 14-year-old girl who sat across from me pushing away her string beans.
The general was once a guest in our home.
He couldn't stop drumming his fork and knife at the table.
Yes, it is a habit I'm afraid I've still yet to break.
General Arnold, I have one request tonight.
A dance with your intended.
Though I might ask for a moment of your time in private.
Yes, there is someone first who begs my attention.
He's coming right for you, Becky.
No, you.
My beloved.
So good of our host to admit you without an escort.
Are you having a good time, Martha?
Yes. Yes.
I've had the pleasurable company of these upstanding young women.
Excuse me, ladies, Miss Redman.
Now, George, if I could have a moment.
(whispers)
He actually showed. The stones.
Pardon me.
Madam.
This is going to be a long night.
We might as well enjoy it, then.
My God, look at the size of this place, eh?
Becky.
Billy, is something wrong?
These new clothes the general insisted on, they's a little tight.
Ah, right, well, why don't you go and do what you must, eh?
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on His Excellency.
: 
Yes, well, we don't often see such beautiful things in camp.
Margaret Shippen.
Ah, yes, soon to be Arnold, I understand.
I'd expect nothing less from the intelligence major.
Tallmadge, yes?
Yeah.
My fiancé speaks very highly of you.
You seem to command his respect.
Well, I merely hope to deserve it.
Mmm, another fan of Cato.
It's Benedict's favorite play as well.
So are you alone, Major Tallmadge?
I am.
Pity.
Care to dance?
I am at your service.
I should think so.
Will you excuse me, ladies?
Thank you.
: Your Excellency.
Had the peonies brought in for Peggy's sister's wedding.
There were a few extra.
Mmm.
George, this court-martial business.
Now, I know you wish to remain impartial, and I respect that, but if you could only see to bringing up the date...
Benedict...
You asked me to step aside.
Now I am willing to do that, to marry that woman, to move on with my life, but I cannot do so until I've addressed these accusations. Please.
My love, new guests have arrived.
Excuse me.
Of course.
(crickets chirping)
(distant dog barking)
(snoring)
: 
: 
I don't even think we need to really be discussing this right now.
There's other things on the table.
Ah, the little sh1t beat me here.
: 
:
Look, we don't have time to discuss this, all right?
Oh, the Rangers, I see.
: 
Agh!
Up against the wall.
(gasps)
Up, all of you.
Do as he says.
Now!
Let her go.
Drop your iron.
You drop yours.
Caleb, do it. It's all right.
Abe? What the... what are you doing here?
I know, shh. Stop it.
Get out of the way.
I know him!
All right?
It's all right.
What in God's name is going on?
Of course you know him. It's Austin Roe.
No, it's Robert Rogers.
Made an impression, didn't I, Mrs. Strong?
Rogers, we are on the same side here.
What?!
But if you hurt her, you die.
You're in no position to threaten me.
I warned you not to follow me, boy.
What's he talking about, Abe?
And who are you?
His name is Brewster, his name is Rogers, but none of our names are gonna mean sh1t past tonight once the Rangers show up.
We all just need to leave.
We're not going anywhere.
I came here to see Robert Townsend 
And neither are any of you.
What do you want with my son?
Same thing all these children want... information.
Look, Simcoe is coming here.
Well, Long Island's a very big place and we've got plenty of time.
:
(woman screaming) No, no!
(whimpering)
:
: 
Fugitive... burly, bearded, wears a patch over one eye.
Have you seen him?
How dare you come in my... ah!
I haven't seen him.
(woman crying)
: 
18 homesteads. Not bad for a day's work.
We'll be at this for weeks unless we narrow the search.
He nearly put a round through your skull, Falkoff.
: 
Not every town is Setauket.
Most haven't collected all the guns.
(crying)
(grunts)
On our way to Monmouth we passed a town popular among Quakers. What was the name?
Oyster Bay.
Quakers don't carry guns.
That's the idea. Let's go.
How many more must I oblige?
Oh.
Master at yet another field.
I expect such deftness when you come to dance with Congress this week.
Joseph.
It's wonderful to see you again, madam.
Now, rumor has it, sir, that you've come about the money.
Retire and recall all bills.
Your spies are better than mine.
I had hoped to count on your support.
I noticed you speaking with our host.
As would be expected in his home.
General Arnold was merely inquiring as to the date of the court-martial.
And so once again the man tries to evade the proper channels.
I don't fault you, sir.
Arnold is just trying to take advantage of your good nature.
The postponement has lasted long enough, don't you think?
I need that time to gather evidence.
Every rock we overturn reveals new facts begging to be brought to light.
That's his hurry.
I'd advise you to let this play out naturally, sir.
You have become quite deft yourself, Joseph.
Well... it seems I've misplaced my wife.
Excuse me.
I never liked that little weevil.
Yes, but now you see the problem.
I do.
If I support Arnold...
You lose Reed's support in Congress.
Well, that is not the problem.
The problem is the very certain fact you will have to make at least one of them unhappy.
I wish to remain impartial.
You wish to be liked.
No, not liked, I... respected by the men.
No, George, you want to be liked.
: Excuse me.
Ahem, General, sir.
Tallmadge. I hadn't seen you.
Thank you for the invitation here this evening.
My pleasure.
It's a grand affair.
I've not attended many to which I can compare it, but I can't imagine most feature a lacquer finished dance floor.
You've truly spared no expense.
Is there something that you wish to say, Major?
Or do you presume to know the content of my private ledgers as well?
Uh, no, of course not, sir. I would never...
If you are uncomfortable in my home, Major, then you can leave at any time.
Sir, I...
(ticking)
Father?
Mr. Townsend, welcome.
Do it, son.
Arms on the table.
 you recently penned a letter to our plucky farmer here concerning a Major John André and the young woman who recently turned his head.
What's her name?
Who is this woman?
Oh, you haven't met her before, have you?
She's one of your merry band.
Let her go.
Maybe I haven't introduced myself.
My name is Robert Rogers and I don't aim to be here all night.
What will you do with the information?
I'm gonna use it to get close to André.
You won't get close enough.
I'm not talking to you!
: 
And once they catch you and torture you, you'll give away this ring and I cannot let that happen.
I was leading the Queen's Rangers against the Iroquois 
:
You let this lot do what we do best and we'll get André for you.
But if you do not put that gun down, you will not be walking out of this room alive.
Now, we are all gonna stand up and walk out of this room slowly.
You're him.
We're...
What?
What?
It's you.
You're the Queen's Ranger.
Shite.
What?
No.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are!
What is this?
Here we go.
Woodhull, is this true?
Yes, it's true. I told him to.
Why?
To manipulate me.
To trick me into undertaking this business.
Yeah.
You lied.
Yes, I lied. I had no other choice.
You always have a choice.
How would you know? You never chose, I chose for you.
Because you couldn't do it yourself.
Mr. Rogers.
The woman's name is Philomena Cheer.
She is an actress.
You will often find her at Rivington's on Wall Street.
Ah, yes, the actress.
I remember her. I can use her.
Well, it's been a great pleasure 
 but if you don't mind, it's getting to be that hour of twilight.
So, you, unprime your firelock.
No chance.
I have already got what I want, so I can kill anyone I like.
But it just seems such a shame to waste a bullet on this, eh?
So blow your powder out your pan.
That's it.
I used to like you, boy.
I did.
But I warned you not to cross me.
:
: Like you said, it'd be a shame to waste a bullet.
An armed Quaker.
Who'd have guessed it? (laughs)
You gonna kill me, "Friend"?
: 
You leave this house.
Hah!
(clicks)
Bollocks!
(laughing)
Bloody Quakers.
(chatter)
You have been avoiding me all night.
You're drunk. You look horrid.
What is the matter with you?
I'm sorry, Peggy.
About all of it.
All of what?
I didn't know how to tell you.
Tell me what?
About Freddy.
Freddy?
You heard from Freddy in New York?
And André.
Becky, what are you talking about?
Philomena?
Becky, who's Philomena?
Oh.
Are you all right, dear?
Mm-hmm.
: 
We need you and you know it.
Yes, and it wasn't personal, all right?
Robert, listen to me.
You won't have to deal with Abe anymore, only me.
You think that I would trust any of you?
(distant horse neighs)
(horses neighing)
It's not over. It's not over.
Come on, come on.
Abe, come on. Woody, come on. Get over here.
(whispering) Come on! Come on! Down, down, down.
: 
They're Quakers.
Okay, all right, let's go.
No, no, no. If Simcoe takes him captive, we'll never get him back.
Then what?
Look, we can't just leave them.
We're looking for a man goes by the name of Culper.
Have you seen anyone?
Yes, there was a man.
He broke in, he demanded supplies.
And left his weapon?
He called that a gift to protect ourselves from any... unfriendly elements, he said.
Yes, seems to think himself quite the jester.
He had another weapon which he took with him, along with a bite of our turkey.
His name wasn't Culper, though.
It was Rogers.
Keep riding west, then?
No.
But he said Rogers...
Left his weapon.
The last man to follow Rogers' tracks took a blade to his throat.
I prefer mine intact.
Well, then where to?
Setauket.
Shh.
All right, let's go back inside.
No.
I need to talk to him.
You're not...
Let me talk to him.
No, you're gonna make this worse if you go back in there.
(chatter)
I've given this much thought.
You see, I must put this country ahead of everything else.
And aggravating valuable members of Congress at a time like this is no small matter.
But neither is turning away this army's most devoted, honorable men.
I will speak to Knox and the other generals.
We will get this matter settled quickly.
You will have your day before the Board of Inquiry.
It is the least you are owed.
Thank you.
Thank you, George.
Come back here at week's end.
I'll be here with Mary and Thomas.
We're coming to you. Samuel Culper's finished.
Abe...
No.
I know what failure looks like, Caleb. The ring is done.
So am I.
You didn't fail, Abe.
You served.
No one could have done what you did for as long as you have.
I have yet to dance with the hostess.
Miss Shippen... would you indulge me?
Ah, Billy, there you are.
Had to undo a few stiches.
Right. Why, did he not have you measured?
He did.
Spent the whole day with him, too.
He didn't even notice.
Suppose we've all so many mickles and muckles on our minds, it's the things right in front of our eyes get missed.
