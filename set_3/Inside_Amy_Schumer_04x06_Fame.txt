Meet you? I just want a photo.
Wow, you should really be nicer to your fans, Jeez.
Hi, can I have a small black coffee?
Name?

Oh, you're Fat Amy from that singing movie.
Pitch something?
No, that's not me.
Yes, it is... I didn't see it, but my brother didn't like it.

Amy? Amy Schumer?
Yeah.
Can I have a selfie?
Oh.
Can you do something funny?
Like, can I pretend to grab your boob?
Ow!

Fat Amy? Fat Amy.
Fat Amy.
Thank you.
Oh, my gosh, uh, can you call my brother?
It is his birthday this summer.
Sure.
Gonna call him?
I can't from my phone. I'm working.
You want me to call him from my phone?
Yeah.
It is 213-555-5555... 5.
Uh, it went right to voice mail.

Hey, Cashew. Uh, it's Amy.
Here with your sister, she's working really hard.
She gave me your number, so, hi, happy birthday this summer... okay.
That wasn't funny.
All right, well, I really have to run, thank you.
It wasn't good, can I take another one?
Yeah, here, let me do it.
You're not cute.

I'm just kidding, see, I'm funny too!
You should make me the show, everybody says I'm just like you, a piece of sh1t.
Okay, thanks.
I hate to be that girl, I'm so that girl right now, though, but, um, can, um...
You want a picture?
No, can I have $100?
I am such a big fan.
I, like, loved you since "Chelsea Lately."
I'm not on that show.
Maybe consider being nicer to people who like you.

Do you have smaller bills?
No.
Must be nice.
Hi, are you Amy Schumer?
I love your legs.
Thank you.
Can I eat one?
What?
What, do you think you're better than everyone else now?
Is that it?
No.
Let me eat your leg.
It wasn't good.
I lost it!

Yeah, that's why I wanted smaller bills.

Why are you ruining my episode of "Katfish"?

I thought I was being katfished by someone pretending to be a model.
But then, I felt like love is about taking a chance and... here you are, and I'm so glad I did.
So, all that stuff you said about being nominated for an Oscar, that was true?
Of course, why would I lie?
That's, like, a really cool thing to get.
And all those awesome stories about you eating shrimp at craft services?
I guess those were all true, too.
I would never lie to you, Amy.
