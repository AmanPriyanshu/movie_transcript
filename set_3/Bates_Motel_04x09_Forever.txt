Yes?
I'm Emma's mother.
She came here, but now Emma hasn't heard from her since, and her phone's been disconnected.
[both grunting]
Rebecca Hamilton?
Yes?
DEA.
I don't want to lose you, Dr. Edwards, but don't you think that it's possible that I might make even more progress if I'm near the person who makes me feel complete?
We're going to start with three sessions a week.
I'll sign your release.
 but I will always remember that you helped my mother at a time that she was so confused.
I love him, and you have to deal with it!
Don't you think she deserves to have a man in her life?
[groans] Agh! I hate you!
Norman?
I'm not leaving this house tonight.
[birds chirping]
You made coffee... I was on my way to do that for you right now.
Yeah.
Yeah. Made a pot a while ago.
It should still be good, if you want one.
You sleep okay?
Mm-mm. Not much.
Alex, that was the hardest part.
Things will be better now.
How so?
Because that was the first time the three of us were under the same roof together.
It was bound to be hard for Norman.
Okay? But we're through it. We're through it.
We ripped off the Band-Aid.
It's gonna be better now.
But having him here is not the solution.
He should be back at Pineview.
He's going back to Pineview.
I'm gonna take him to therapy today.
That's not the same, and you know that.
I don't know that. I'm not a doctor, and neither are you, so you don't know that either.
I'm... I'm never gonna be that guy who just tells you what you want to hear, okay?
And I don't want you to be that guy.
I don't feel safe leaving you alone with him.
That's ridiculous.
I don't think it is.
No. That is so ridiculous.
You are overreacting.
What if I'm not?
It's just... no one knows Norman like I do.
We... we are two parts of the same person.
There's no possible way he could ever, ever in any way hurt me, ever.
He... you're just so wrong.
I really hope I am.
[door opening]
[swallows, sighs]
[inhales deeply]
No, no, I've got to get to work.
You're not gonna take a shower or anything?
No, I'll do it at home, okay?
Can we talk later?
Okay.
Norma, I'll see you later.
Okay. Yeah.
Alex slept on the couch.
Oh, it's fine.
You should go upstairs and get dressed or we'll be late for therapy.
Okay, honey. Okay.
I'll go get ready.
[crackling electricity]
Do you want to put up the Christmas lights later?
I waited for you to do that.
I know you have very strong feelings about Christmas lights.
Okay. Yes.
Then, uh, sure, we can do that.
Maybe we could ask Alex to help.
You're joking.
[sighs] Okay.
I know last night did not go well, but we can't get caught up in that.
And I believe in you. I believe in Alex, and I know this can work.
It's...
I mean, it's gonna feel shitty for a little while, but we can get through it, right?
We can live through it.
You know, just think of Alex as someone you could share the burden of your crazy mother.
My mother, she barely knows this man, and then she just ups and marries him.
That's so like her.
Oh, and I found out that she married him for the insurance... to pay for all of this. Did you know that?
That he was paying?
No, I didn't know that.
Hm, well, it is not exactly normal, is it, to marry someone for their insurance?
Well, perhaps she felt like she had no other choice.
Uh, no.
No, I don't think that is it.
What is it, then?
That the marriage is, uh... is real!
"Oh, hello, here's your new dad.
"Oh, look at the sheriff.
Here we all are together, one big, happy family."
Would that be so bad?
Yes, it would, because it is not real.
It is all about her fear of being alone.
And so when I went away and she was alone, the Sheriff... whoo, old Alex, he had no problem stepping in.
I've always had this feeling that he's hated me, and now I know why.
He wanted to be with her.
Oh, he couldn't wait for me to be locked up in here and pay for it so he could just get to her.
Oh, let me tell you, though. He has got a big surprise coming when he realizes just how difficult she can be and how damaged she really is!
Everyone sees this part of her that is normal and friendly and happy.
But I see what is really there.
That she is as frightened and tiny and fragile inside as a baby bird...
And that she's lived her whole life that way because she can just be crushed by disappointment.
Oh, but she doesn't let anyone else see that but me.
He's got no idea what he's got coming for him.
What'll happen next is that he won't measure up to her standards.
She'll start to pass judgment on him.
Not like this or that.
She'll criticize him.
And after a while, he'll leave.
He'll run away. He'll be gone.
Her heart will be broken, and then it'll be little old me picking up all the broken pieces...
If I can.
[phone beeps]
[cell phone buzzing]
Hi. You okay?
Alex, please, he's... he's trying really, really hard.
It's gonna be fine. I promise.
Yeah... the important goal here is to get him better, and having him home right now, it might seem right short-term, but it's just... it's...
You don't know that.
Okay, ask the doctor what he thinks is best.
Five minutes of marriage doesn't give you the right to make decisions about my son.
I... I'm not trying to do that, and you know that.
I'm... I'm... I'm shining a light on the truth, whether you want to see it or not.
I hear the judgment in your voice.
You're not giving him a chance, and it hurts me.
I... I'm not trying to hurt you.
 you don't want to make room for him or something.
No... that's ludicrous.
Is it? 
Yes, yes, it is.
[melancholy music]
Yeah. I... I got to go.
Okay? He's... he's out. I got to go. Bye.
Hey, let me get that. Here.
It's full of scarves and hats, see?
Not gonna break.
But I left the boxes of books upstairs.
Will you give this back to Norma?
I borrowed it, and she left this in the pocket.
She's probably been missing it.
Yeah, no problem.
Thank you.
What is it, Mother?
What happened?
Nothing.
I feel like this is all my fault and I've ruined everything.
No, honey, no... no.
You are my whole life.
You always have been.
Other people are just gonna have to understand that.
You are my son.
I am your son, and I always will be.
Yeah.
Oh, thank you.
My client has considered your offer and is willing to cooperate, depending on the terms, of course, but let's clarify our deal first.
We'll give you Bob Paris's murderer in exchange for no jail time, probation only.
Not if she's an accessory.
I can't make that deal.
She's not.
Yeah.
But she knows who did it.
What if my client were able to prove that the murderer was Sheriff Alex Romero?
You can give us Romero?
Yeah.
How?
My client is willing to wear a wire.
And why would he confess to her?
Because we've had a long-standing romantic relationship.
What's up?
Thanks for meeting me here.
Hi. Just a... just coffee, thanks.
What's going on?
Um...
I don't think, uh... I don't think Norman should be out of the mental institution.
I think he might... I think he's dangerous.
And honestly, I'm... I'm afraid to leave Norma alone with him.
Okay, now, I'm... I'm only curious, but have you ever seen him exhibit violent behavior?
[sighs]
Yes. Yeah, I have.
I don't think he should be home either.
Okay. Well, Norma can't, uh... she won't see it.
You're, uh... you're preaching to the choir.
And I don't want to do this, but it might come down to us having to have him committed.
You mean behind Norma's back?
Well, she's never gonna do it herself.
Now, I can start legal proceedings to have him formally committed if I get the signatures of two family members.
You mean you and me.
I don't know if I can do that to her.
Well, I'm afraid something more's gonna happen if we don't, Dylan.
Well, let me... let me try and talk to her. Okay?
[washing machine whirring]
[sustained beep]
Oh, God. I didn't hear you come in.
Where's Norman?
He's down at the motel.
What's wrong?
I, um...
I found this...
In the pocket of your coat.
Emma was worried you might be missing it.
Yeah, I was missing it. What?
This isn't your earring, Norma.
This is Emma's mother's.
She was wearing it in the hospital.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right.
I would never wear that.
Can I have it?
No, you can't.
I don't know what your problem is, Dylan.
Why did you have it, Norma?
I just found it outside.
I must have put it in my pocket.
Then why were you pretending like it was yours?
It didn't seem worth explaining.
Why are you making such a big deal out of it?
You need to listen to me, Norma.
You're just talking a bunch of nonsense.
I don't need to hear it. I have enough going on.
It's just a stupid earring.
It doesn't mean anything.
Then why were you keeping it?
Stop hiding, Norma!
I'm not hiding! What is wrong with you?
Why did you have that earring in your pocket?
I told you why!
Stop lying to me!
What do you want from me, Dylan?
I want you to face the truth that's...
It's right in front of us!
Norman is sick!
He's seeing a doctor!
He's seeing a doctor...
No! He shouldn't be...
.. three times a week!
.. out of the institution!
He's dangerous!
You don't know that!
I know enough!
Why do you keep doing this?
Because I'm afraid of what's gonna happen, of what's already happened.
Stop being dramatic!
You're just inventing all of this.
You're making sh1t up because you're jealous of him!
You always have been!
[sighs] I'm sorry.
It's not just me.
Romero thinks the same, that Norman should be committed.
Dylan, wait. Wait!
How do you know how he feels? How do you know that?
Because he told me.
Okay? We talked. He... he's worried just like I am.
He thinks that when it comes to Norman, you can't see clearly.
What?
You're... you're so blind to the... and you're trying so hard to protect him that you can't see what's right around you!
So the two of you are getting together behind my back?
Why? What's he gonna do about it?
What... what... does he want to commit Norman without telling me?
You should ask him.
Dylan, tell me.
Just... just talk to him, okay? Leave...
Dylan, I'm your mother!
You've never been a real mother to me!
Never!
Look, I... I have tried, okay?
And I... I know that you've tried, too, and I... I can't do... I can't do this anymore.
I'm done, Norma.
Dylan.
Please give me the earring, please.
[door closes]
[door closes]
Dylan?
What... what's happening? What's going on?
What... what...
Dylan!
Norman, you're not well.
You need to check yourself back into Pineview.
Please. Mom's never gonna do it for you.
You have to do it for yourself.
What are you talking about?
Don't say anything to him.
Good-bye, Norman.
Dylan.
Dylan, what's going on?
What's happening?
Mother?
[dishes rattling]
Mother?
What just happened? Tell me.
Dylan doesn't think that you should be home.
Why?
'Cause everyone thinks they know more about you than I do.
They're wrong.
Everyone?
Does Alex think this too?
Yeah. I'll handle it.
I have to go. I'm gonna to talk to Alex.
Okay.
You stay here until I get back, though, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Mother?
I could get those Christmas tree lights out, and we could both start on that tomorrow.
Yes, honey. I would love that.
I love you, Mother.
I love you.
Hey.
I thought you were going to, uh... to Indianapolis.
Meh. I realized it was foolish for me to try and run.
So what now?
Well, now I'm gonna eat my lunch and then get back to the bank.
Do you remember when, um... when we first met?
It was at Bob's.
Yeah, I remember.
[chuckles] I hope you do.
Afterwards we, uh... we went back to my place, and I don't think we got any sleep at all.
You do remember that part, don't you?
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
There is one thing that I never quite understood: how you and Bob were friends in the first place.
I mean, you knew what he was doing, that he was in the drug trade, and you were the sheriff, but that didn't, like, really matter, so I never quite understood that part, how that worked, your... your morality.
Bob Paris was in the drug trade?
I didn't... I didn't know that.
[scoffs] Was it because you two were friends from when you were kids?
But apparently that didn't really matter when you put a bullet in his head.
Why did you do it, Alex?
So how did it go down?
Where'd the DEA catch you? Was it here?
Where's the mic?
I just want to make sure I'm heard.
Where is it?
All right, come here.
Uh, this is... this is to all my friends over at the DEA.
I've done nothing but be helpful to you, and it's 'cause of me that you made dozens of arrests, and you shut down the drug business in this town, and now you want to come after me?
Well, you can all go to hell. All right?
Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
Your wife's here.
She's in your office.
Hey.
How dare you.
What?
How dare you go behind my back to my own son to try and get Norman taken away from me?
Who the hell do you think you are?
Someone who loves you and is worried about you.
And Norman.
That's nice that that's how you frame it in your head, but how it looks from here is that you are an incredibly presumptuous and arrogant man who thinks he knows what's best for me and my son.
Wow. I'm sorry you see it that way.
No one who loves me could ever do this to me.
No. That's where you're wrong. He's dangerous.
He's my son!
You don't think I would know if he was dangerous?
He had an axe in his hand, and he wanted to kill me!
Yeah, well, are you dead?
The point is, he didn't! He was angry!
He took it out on the shed and on my door.
You know, [sigh] we were happy when we were in a bubble, but life isn't a bubble.
You know, the second that a little reality crept in, that was it for you.
Bam. So much for the stupid bubble.
You can spin it however you want, Norma.
It doesn't make it the truth.
You just... you can't see clearly here 'cause this is about Norman.
Yeah, because he's my son!
You're gonna plant yourself on the mountain like you're God and tell me how things work with my son?
Wrong. You crossed over a line, and you are never crossing back.
I will never trust you again.
No, you left me no choice.
And you left me none.
[ominous music]
[wind whistling]
[dirt thumps]
[water running]
[door creaks open]
Where have you been, Mother?
I was worried about you.
Just, um...
What? What happened?
You were right.
It's not gonna work with Alex and me.
I'm sorry, Mother.
It's okay.
Another day, another dollar, whatever.
Leftovers okay, honey?
[ragged breathing]
[crying]
[sobbing]
I'm so sorry, Mother.
I just came to say good night.
Come in, honey.
[sighs]
[sniffles]
I think maybe we should move somewhere else.
So much has happened here.
We have tried our best, Mother.
We really have.
I know we love this old house, but I don't think you can say it's been a good place for us.
I don't know. In some ways it has.
Well, why are we both broken right now, Mother?
Life is hard, but we still have each other, and we will always have each other, and nothing will ever change that, and that's everything.
Do you remember when you said you wanted to go and move to Oahu?
That it was safer because it was an island?
[laughs] I do.
I remember.
Then why don't we go there?
[laughs]
Because we have no money.
Well, so we save up.
We sell what we can sell.
The furniture in this place must be worth something.
We just walk away from the house.
We let the bank have it.
We buy two tickets to Oahu.
We get jobs there.
We get a little apartment and walk on down to the beach every day and live on macadamia nuts.
[laughs]
[both laughing]
You always loved new beginnings, Mother.
Fresh starts.
I don't think I can start over, Norman.
I think you can, Mother.
You will.
We'll just do it together.
Are you serious? - Mm-hmm.
You really want to do it?
Yeah.
Yeah. I do. I really do.
Yeah, it sounds crazy, but... but nice.
Look at us, Mother.
We are very charming people.
[both laughing]
The hospitality business on the islands will just swoop us up.
[laughs]
I just think we can do anything as long as we're together.
We're supposed to be together, aren't we, Norman?
Are we?
Yeah.
Yes, we are, Mother. Forever.
