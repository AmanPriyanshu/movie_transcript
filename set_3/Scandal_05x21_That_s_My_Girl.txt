How the hell did you mess this up?
[Cheers and applause]
: Thank you!
We're here to nominate a president... [Cheers and applause] and I've got one in mind.
[Cheers and applause continue]
Sounds like you've got someone in mind, too.
You better be enjoying this, Mellie Grant.
[Laughs] I am!
The next president of the United States.
Hey, hey, hey.
I got your call.
I mean, this isn't the ideal place to kill him, but I think I can make it work.
And don't worry, I won't do it in front of Ella.
Michael and I are getting back together, so that means you and I are done.
What is going on, Cyrus?
Between you and me, nothing anymore.
I'm sorry.
Don't.
Don't say that, all right?
Just tell me.
Whatever I did, I can make it up to you, I promise.
It's not gonna work out, Tom.
Hey!
You made it!
We did.
[Sighs]
Big night.
It is.
I'm so happy you're here.
Hey, come on.
Come on, come on!
Let's go. Let's go.
Mellie Grant will be a leader.
Mellie Grant will be a uniter.
And Mellie Grant...
Well, trust me, everyone, she was born to do this job.
[Cheers and applause]
[Crowd chanting "Mellie"]
Jake.
Hey.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm getting ready for the game.
[Chuckles]
You realize you're meant to be onstage in five minutes.
I forgot to thank you.
You stood up to Command, stared him down.
Far as I can tell, you're the first person who's ever done that.
Go big or go home, right?
Come on, put your tie on.
The President's about to announce you.
I don't want you looking like a gigolo.
[Chuckles]
[Sighs] Jake?
I'm not coming.
What are you talking about?
[Cheers and applause in distance]
I'm taking myself off the ticket.
You're joking.
There's no need for it, Liv.
I'm sitting here practicing my speech, and all I can think is "Why?"
Why run for Vice President when frankly, I'd rather flip patties at Gettysburger.
You'd be the second most powerful person on the planet.
And completely miserable.
I-If I still feared your father, yeah.
Your name is on the poster.
We announced you.
Check out this house that's for sale.
I drive by it every day on my way to the office.
It is the most normal, unremarkable house I've ever seen in my life, and I desperately want to live in it with you.
Have you lost your mind?
It's three blocks away from an equally unimpressive high school.
I can coach their JV baseball team, help them reach unimpressive heights while raising three unimpressive kids with you.
I'm running a presidential race.
Yeah, and why is that?
"Why is that?!"
If it's to prove something to your father, you've already done that.
Come on, Liv! Dare to be normal!
Put the tie on.
The world is our now.
We can literally do whatever the hell we want!
Put the tie on!
That's real power, Liv.
Not this other crap.
[Scoffs]
I have not gone through what I've gone through, worked twice as hard for half as much, only to end up living an unimpressive life!
Mediocrity is not an option for me!
I don't want that, and neither should you!
I see.
[Cheering in distance]
So, it wasn't about saving me at all, was it?
It was about saving your ticket.
[Cheers and applause in distance]
I've gone from being his bitch to yours.
Put the tie on.
[Cheers and applause in distance]

Well, the time has come.
It is my distinct honor and privilege...
[Sighs] Thank God.
All set?
To introduce to you...
You betcha.
Your Republican presidential nominee, Senator Mellie Grant!
And the next Vice President of the United States, Jake Ballard!
[Cheers and applause]
♪
Have you heard?
Vargas just announced his running mate.
Who is it?
Abby, who is it?
[Cellphone rings]
You were never gonna put David Rosen on the ticket.
David Rosen? God, no. I'm trying to win, Liv.
You used me.
Oh, please.
This was a mutually beneficial arrangement.
We both got the vice presidents we wanted.
I can still take you down.
How would you do that?
One word... Harrisburg.
Two words... Andrew Nichols.
[Cheers and applause in distance]
Let's focus on the positives here instead.
One of us is getting back to the White House.
I got to run.
: And Vice President of the United States, Francisco Vargas and Cyrus Beene!

I have spent a lifetime keeping you safe from harm, a lifetime worrying about your fate, a lifetime making sure that the path in front of you was clear of debris.
You are Rowan's greatest achievement.
You've become exactly the woman he raised you to be.
You have to be what?
Twice as good.
You held power in your hands.
You were power.
You had the Oval.
My baby had the Oval.
You will look at all the possible outcomes.
You'll understand what needs to be done.
You will pick a side, and then you will handle this situation in the manner we both know it needs to be handled.
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue power.
You will burn it down and never look back.
The apple does not fall far from the tree, Olivia, poison though it may be.

Yes.
And?
He said, "One of us is getting back to the White House."
