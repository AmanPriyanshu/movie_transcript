That's my book.
I'm sorry. I was just skimming through it.
You were drooling.
You don't strike me as a girl that likes to read smut.
Men have become these like passive little boys.
Oh, have they?
When you get back, you have to have the talk.
I'm slowly dying here without you.

Good morning.
Oh, yes, it is.
Why? What happened?
Rafe was pulling out of the driveway when I got home this morning.
Looks like the good girl had a bad girl night.
It's not what you think.
It's exactly what we think.
Was it epic?
It was... fine.
Fine?
Yeah, it was just fine.
Fine is sh1t.
Fine is not what you need right now.
I want every horrific detail, but first I gotta go pee.
Get me a coffee?
You didn't tell her, did you?
About what?
The surprise party.
Oh. No, I wouldn't do that.
Because she was asking if the three of us wanted to hang on Saturday, so I thought maybe she suspected something.
No, I would never do that. I know how to keep a secret.
Good to know. Too bad Rafe doesn't.
What can I get you?
Yeah, can I get a medium sugar free mocha with almond milk?
I need to take this.
Please tell me you sent the check.
