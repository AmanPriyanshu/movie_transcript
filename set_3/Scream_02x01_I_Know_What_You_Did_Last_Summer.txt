You can't do a slasher movie as a TV Series.
Ever heard of Brandon James?
Who's Brandon James?
??? and the murderer started.
Lina, Rachel, even my girlfriend Riley.
???
A few times, actually.
??? ??? ??? ???
She turned out to be Emma's half sister.
Piper?
Hey, sister.
(screams)
I have one more surprise for you.
(gun shot)
Thankfully, my BFF, Audrey, put a bullet in Piper's chest.***
And Emma finished her off.
???
Piper told Emma she had one more surprise for her.
Piper!
Why is your DNA on the inside of the mask?
???
(Telephone ringing)
(Meows)
(Ringing stops)
Hey there, girl. So, my date tonight... hot but dumb.
He completely judged my ringtone.
(Girl laughs) 
Becca, please, I'm not you. I don't "hook up."
(Scoffs) Butterscotch? Wait a sec. Where's Butterscotch?
I'll call you back, okay?
Butterscotch?
(Banging, cat meows)
Butterscotch?
Butterscotch?
(Suspenseful music playing)
Kitty?
(Stairs creaking)
Kitty?
Butterscotch?
(Screams)
(Sighs)
Butterscotch?
(Meows)
Hey! There you are.
Hey. Come to me, girl. How'd you do that, huh?
(Meows)
(Phone beeps)
Call Becca.
: 
(Line ringing)
(Phone rings)
(Screams) Becca!
(Sighs) That's not funny!
Really?
What about this?
Is that funny?
No.
(All gasp)
(Audience gasping, screaming)
Why?
Because I'm so sick of your slut-shaming!
(Screams, body thuds)
(Phone vibrates)
(Phone vibrates)
(Phone vibrates)
(Woman screaming in movie)
(Screaming continues)
(Phone vibrating)
: 
Hey, did you just send me some creepy texts?
I wouldn't put it past a creepy guy like me, but no. What were they?
He was trying to scare me.
Huh, that's weird.
Hey, I was actually about to head out to Emma's welcome home party, and I figured maybe I could swing by and we could just caravan over together.
Sounds like a plan.
Is it a bad idea to ask Emma to interview for the podcast tonight?
Noah, that's a horrible idea.
No talking about your podcast or the incident.
Okay, which incident are we not talking about?
All the murder stuff, or what happened to her at school after?
Either. Neither. Don't freak her out.
Okay, okay, okay. I'm on my way.
(Indistinct chatter)
: I'm so freaked out.
: I know!
: It was insane!
: You're telling me.
(Phone vibrates)
(Phone vibrates)
No more fun to be had here, guys.
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.
Thank you.
Oh!
Sorry, dude.
It's okay. I didn't know if anyone was here.
No way. You're that...
Audrey, right? The badass that shot Piper Shaw in the head?
Technically, not the one who shot her in the head.
We both go to George Washington, but you don't know me. Can I get a pic?
Sure.
It's lame, I know. It's just...
You really impress me, dude, and I hate everyone.
Thanks.
Sure.
Um, the front door needs a key.
Um, can't find the key. I can walk you out the back?
It's so crazy how no one even suspected Piper, right? That's what everyone says.
You know, that's what they say.
Hey! Who did that?
Some moron must've snuck in...
(Door opens)
Get out of the booth, idiot! We're closed!
(Suspenseful music playing)
(Singing continues)
The keys, the keys!
We have to get out of here.
Someone's wearing the mask and he's trying to... (Screaming)
(Screaming repeatedly)
(Muffled) Audrey! Audrey! Hey!
Audrey! Audrey!
: She stabbed me.
(Gasps)
She stabbed me!
What? Oh, my God! What did you do?
(Siren blaring in distance)
You're alive?
It was a prank!
What?
A prank, a prank!
Get up, get up. You're okay. Get up.
Come on, come on. Get up, get up. You'll be okay. It's okay. Get up.

Season 2 Episode 1


(Siren blaring)
: Behind the tape, please.
: Is he okay?
Him? He's got a small puncture wound.
The strappy thing holding his camera deflected the blade just enough.
He's going to be fine, and you seem fine, too.
So, I think we're just about done here.
She gets a license to kill 'cause she shot Piper?
I know you're new here, officer, and from a big city, or whatever...
Actually, I'm from Lakewood originally.
Then, you should know, around here, someone gets stabbed, someone gets arrested.
Uh, that's not true.
Plus, you two attacked me.
It was a joke!
Less of a crime, more of a 
 clip.
Right.
So, goofball assault versus desperate act of self-defense.
Desperate act of self-defense wins.
And you were live streaming, so she's got evidence to win a civil suit.
My advice... walk away.
(Siren blaring)
: 
(Laughs) Audrey just broke the Internet, again.
Yeah, and not a word to Emma. Okay? It's her first night back.
We don't want to freak her into another meltdown.
She probably already saw it. My phone has been blowing up for, like, an hour.
Hey! I've got our Internet hero.
Oh! That was awesome, bi-otch. Up high.
Yeah, get this out of your system now, Jake.
There's no post-gaming when Emma gets here.
: Not a word, Jake, not a word!
She just texted. She'll be here in a minute.
Sandalwood, a hint of citrus...
Someone's very excited to see Emma this evening.
Beer in the fridge?
Yes, please!
: You're a tough bitch, Audrey.
I thought they broke up.
They did, sorta. It's complicated.
But you and I are going to have to find another crash pad for "Brooke and Jake's special time."
Well, my parents fly out to Mexico tomorrow morning.
Maybe you could come by before school?
Hm, I have a better idea.
(Knocks on door)
That's her.
: Come on, get ready. Light the candle.
Hey, Em.
Hey.
Welcome back.
: What's taking so long out there?
: Jake, shut up!
Are you wearing cologne?
Maybe.
: Hey!
Welcome home, girl interrupted!
Tact.
No, it's a compliment 'cause Angelina's hot.
Guys, it's okay. I had some issues and I dealt with them.
And, now, I'm back here because I want to get back to normal.
Okay? It would really suck if you guys started acting all weird around me.
It's really good to have you home.
I love you.
It's so good to have you back.
Hey!
So, how long are they gonna let you live here on your own?
My aunt Tina's supposed to check on me once a week, but she's a flake.
I haven't seen her in a month.
Thank you for tonight.
And for keeping in touch.
It means a lot.
We said we were still friends.
What friends don't write, right?
(Chuckles)
I told my mom I was spending the night at Audrey's house, but...
Just stick around here.
Yeah.
We could...
Talk.
(Door closing)
(Bottles clattering)
Cool.
Uh, pay no attention to the incredibly awkward entrance by the gawky comic relief guy with zero timing.
It's a school night. We should wrap this puppy up.
Noah Foster, killer of parties.
Well, at least some things are how I left them.
It's your first night back, so I'll let that one slide...
If...
If what?
If you let me interview you for my podcast. You're the only one of the Lakewood Six who hasn't been on it yet.
The Lakewood Six?
Yeah, that's what everyone's been calling us recently.
I coined it, actually. It caught on pretty quick.
It's not genius or anything, but it's catchy.
Noah, I have to let all of that stuff go.
I get it. It's just... that was the biggest thing that ever happened to us.
Yeah, and the worst.
You know, to be honest, I have never listened to your podcast.
Sorry.
(Ringtone playing)
Hello?
: 
You too can menace girls for just 99 cents with this nifty voice modulator app.
I'm really just bored.
Thought you could get away with murder, didn't you? Well, you can't.
Did you like the feeling of that ice pick in your hand?
Do you like being a creeper?
After what you did, you deserve it.
(Ringtone playing)
Looks like those two at the movie theater met up on the comment section of my podcast.
Yet another reason to reconsider inheriting a psycho killer's web legacy.
Hey! The Morgue is not her podcast. I'm just co-opting her listeners.
Right now, I'm using it to help figure out exactly who those pranksters were.
So, be grateful.
The girl's name is Hayley, and she apparently goes to our school, but how are you doing this?
They got into a back-and-forth with a bunch of nasty trolls, who thought it'd be real funny to spook the local hero: you.
The thread begins with...
"Let's show the world Audrey Jensen isn't much of a bad-ass."
And that would be a fail. The funny thing is, the guy who instigated the whole thing didn't even show up.
Wow.
Never read the comment section.
I just think it's hilarious.
What, you're putting this on the murderboard?
They wore Brandon James masks and attacked you, one of the two survivor girls who ended Piper's rampage.
Can't you see? It's all connected.
Look, Noah, you are officially obsessed.
Okay? And I'm sorry that this got you so worked up.
Get some sleep.
Sleep is overrated.
: 
You know what's better than breaking into school for night swimming?
Sneaking in for skinny dipping.
(Giggles, sighs)
I'm scandalized.
My dad will turn into a walking after school special... if I get home too late.
Then, why don't you make it up to me?
Be my date to the Lakewood Days Carnival.
You can't hide me forever.
Well, I wouldn't have to... if you hadn't blackmailed my dad.
He moved a dead body.
He hates you.
And, as pathetic as that is, there's less than nothing I can do to change that.
'Cause you don't have the lady balls to do anything about it.
Lady balls? Ew.
Do you know what I think?
You enjoy this sneaking around, like how you did with Mr. Branson.
Dick. You know, I can't believe for one brain-dead second I actually thought that this could work.
It can't.
We're done.
Fine! Walk away. 'Cause you know what? Jake's got a plan.
I'm going to prove you wrong, and your dad's going to love me.
And you know what? That's two birds, one Jake, baby!
And when you find out, you're gonna come crawling back!
Good luck with that.
You'll see.
(Quietly) I love you.
I know I broke things off really suddenly.
I just...
(Sighs) ...had to get away from everything.
You don't need to explain that to me.
I really missed you guys.
I really missed you.
I missed you too, Emma.
I feel safe with you.
: 
(Gasps)
It's okay. It's all okay.
I'm so sorry.
Can we just sleep?
Of course.
(Pig squealing, faint)
(Squealing continues)
(Pig squealing)
(Squealing grows louder)
(Squealing continues)
(Girl laughing)
(Laughing continues)
(Flies buzzing)
(Buzzing grows louder)
(Screams)
(Laughing)
(Breathing heavily)
Kieran?
(To himself) All right, Brooke.
Time for the Jake to prove you wrong.
(Screams)
Help!
(Groaning)
Oh, no... No, no, no...
You said would spend a night at Audrey's and when you weren't there, I was scared.
I'm sorry. I was just having fun.
I know kids lie to their parents about stuff, but you don't do that.
It's not you. You've always been honest with me.
Yeah, well, everything is a little bit different now.
Look, last night... it was your first night home after three months, and I was happy to let you be with your friends, but...
This morning, I wanted to do something nice for your first day back at school.
When I couldn't find you, it kinda felt like you were running away from me.
I... I guess I was, a little.
I want to change that.
I hope we can.
I don't know, Mom.
Okay? I have to go to school.
(Door opens, closes)
(Sighs)
You took that guy down, Audrey! We watched it, like, 20 times!
Oh, wow! Maybe I could stab you, too? Morons.
It's a new extension of your celebrity. You were already a hero.
Now, you're an Internet hero. It's an exponential leap.
You always find the silver lining.
Okay, I've got a good one.
My down-low affair with Jake Fitzgerald is officially over.
What? Since when?
Last night.
You okay?
Let's just not with the concern and the feelings.
I'm only telling you 'cause Jake's going to tell you anyway, and I probably come off really bad in his version.
How's Jake?
Wrong question.
Anyone seen Emma?
She's on her way.
Maggie found out she spent the night at Kieran's.
Ugh, Maggie drama.
It's her first day back to school since the infamous meltdown.
The last thing she needs is more tension.
: Hey!
Emma!
You look fantastic! Fantastic!
So good! Wow!
Wow. All right. Enough with the eggshells. Let's go.
: 
(Breathing heavily)
(Sobbing)
Hey... you good?
Yeah!
I'm fine.
So, it was a complete breakup?
Fast and painless.
It wasn't painless.
Oh, please. It was time.
New subject. How was last night with Kieran?
(Scoffs) I haven't seen him all day. Does that answer your question?
I don't know. We fell asleep together, and then...
I woke up and found him curled up on the couch.
Kind of adorable. Kind of sad.
Yeah, more sad. And I texted him to apologize, and all he did was respond with, "Ha-ha."
Then, nothing. I don't know. I guess I thought I could hit the reset button and start all over.
Well, boys are not iPhones. I wish they were.
Hey, Em. Welcome back.
Hey, Zoe.
Hey, Sigmund and Sigmunda Freuds!
Anyway, did everyone enjoy the reading assignment?
Noah's got a little crush.
Really? You liked it? I didn't.
I thought it was dull. I mean, mesocortical dopaminergic pathways are fine and good, but how does psychology relate to our living lives?
That's what turns me on, and that's what I want to turn you guys onto.
Let's think outside the textbook.
Emma! Good to have you back.
What part of psychology would be helpful to you in your life?
Uh... dream analysis?
Excellent.
Why do we dream? Why do dreams matter?
Why would that psycho skill evolve with us?
Phantasmata and dreams help us process our leftover fear and anxiety.
It's, like, the garbage disposal of the psyche.
Nice, Zoe. Dreams are personal, right?
So, let's make it personal. How about what this town has been through?
Is it giving any of us nightmares? Scary but necessary.
We are churning through what holds us back.
Just like 
: Seriously, Noah?
A movie about a knife-fingered psycho slashing kids in their dreams?
It's necessary?
The only way for Nancy to face Freddy and learn the truth is through her nightmares.
Scary but necessary.
But do we actually need horror movies like we need our dreams?
They work the same way. Maybe that's why the dream motif is so constant.
And here he goes.
Movies like 
Taking subconscious fears and externalizing them is what horror is all about.
You go to the movies, it ends, the lights come up, and then, everybody goes home feeling better.
Or they go home to the horror of their actual lives.
Now, this is the kind of dialogue...
(Whispering) He's new. Sheriff's son. Super creepy.
Let's continue on this. I want you all to start keeping a dream journal.
Keep them by your bed.
(Whispering) In case you want to talk through stuff.
So, when we're talking about dreams and we're referring to the id, ego, and super-ego, does anybody know which one of those three the dream analysis will fall under?
Anybody?
: 
You got what Miss Lang was saying about paradoxical sleep, right?
Yeah, isn't it fascinating?
I mean, it's, like, in direct opposition to the hypnagogic sensation theory we studied last week.
Is it? I wouldn't know. I wasn't there for that class, or a lot of other classes, actually.
Um, I was wondering, would you mind helping me catch up?
Yeah, totally, but are you sure you don't want Noah or someone else to help you out with that?
I think he has ulterior motives regarding his podcast, so...
Besides, you're one of the few people at this school who doesn't stare.
Okay, yeah, I'm in.
Hey! I haven't heard from you since this morning.
It was fun.
I'm sorry.
I saw you on the couch. I hope I didn't weird you out.
I didn't want to wake you. That's all.
I'll see you later.
Yeah.
(Phone dings, vibrates)
You're too focused on the ending.
I'm sorry?
I'm talking about your horror viewpoint from psych class.
It's too basic. You read 
Comic books.
Horror comic books. Take Madder Red from 
We're not sure if he's a hero or still a blood-lusting freak.
Could be both. Every issue has a twist leading to a cliff hanger.
The dramatic conundrum keeps generating bloodshed.
And there's always another issue... and another...
Kinda like Lakewood.
Killing never ends.
I agree. That is a broader perspective.
That never happens to me.
So, this happened.
Uh, what exactly?
It's no big deal. It's just another stupid prank and I should ignore it, right?
Ignoring anything is certain death.
We should go to the cops, immediately.
No, no, no. Noah, I don't want to go...
I just wanted... Noah, come back here with my phone!
(Breathing heavily)
(Groans)
(Grunting)
(Camera beeps)
(Breathing heavily)
(Suspenseful music playing)
(Faint police radio chatter)
I get it. It's scary. You're a local hero.
It increases your street cred, but makes people want to mess with you.
I know what you're thinking. It's probably the pranksters from last night.
Which is probably right. This is a stupid waste of time.
They called late in the night. They keep texting.
It's more than just a prank.
Hey!
Why don't you get your friend a soda?
Oh, okay. Yes, sir. Right away.
He wants to file a report, but it's not up to him.
Re-read this. If you want to file it, you sign it.
I'm going to get a refill.
(Door opens)
(Phone vibrates)
: You know, that clip is still blowing up.
We could use that digital influence and my podcast to crowdsource and find the caller ourselves.
Stop, Noah! Just stop.
Have you ever thought that maybe it's your stupid, crazy podcast that did this?
Crazy? The Morgue? You've been on it, like, seven times already.
Yeah, but maybe it's time to stop obsessing over these murders.
It was just a crank call, Noah. Let's go.
(Scoffs)
Piper is dead.
We shot her. That movie's over.
Roll credits. Leave the freaking theater.
???
You know you can admit that you miss Jake, right?
I'm pissed that he turned into the kind of guy that made me care.
He's been MIA all day.
He's torturing me.
He really made you care?
He changed, Em. He stepped up.
You were gone. My dad was going through all this legal crap.
Jake was kind of my rock.
It's hard to imagine Jake being anybody's rock.
A lot changed since you were away. Life went limping on.
(Sighs)
You should be glad you have Kieran.
He really missed you.
Yeah, I think my freak-out really freaked him out.
He's been dodging me all day.
Last night, it was like he thought I was going to break or something.
I don't know. Maybe he just sees me as the broken girl, and he's just not up for it.
We're all breakable, Emma. At least you had therapy.
The rest of us just partied the crazy away.
You're probably the strongest one of us all.
No, not Kieran. He's granite.
Trust me, he's breakable.
Kieran doesn't go into his dad's room. That's how breakable he is.
He just hides all that stuff. You both do. You're both a mess.
Now, grab me a trash bag. You get one teddy bear. One!
This is absurd. Take your pick.
Okay, I got the point.
(Both laugh)
(Knock on door)
Romero-thon tonight. Are you in? Or are you still pissed?
Nah. Figured I'd turn in, you know?
Get my dream journal on.
Okay, still pissed.
So, I might have gotten a little yell-y scream-y earlier.
You only get that mad when you know that I'm right.
Shut up and walk me through the murderboard.
And we're back. That text at school today was your most recent contact, right?
That's right.
Okay, here's that text.
And, over here, I've included the comments of the third prankster from my podcast.
Note the parallel verbiage, the repeated phrases.
Uh, bad-ass, killer, bloodletter. Too close for coincidence.
I'd wager that your texter and the third prankster are one and the same.
So, some demented troll with a grudge is out to catfish me?
Or this demented troll, as you rightly put it, was Piper's accomplice.
There was no accomplice.
I disagree. I think someone helped Piper, and I think they're still out there.
I think that this prank and those calls may lead us to that person.
(Suspenseful music playing)
I was stupid.
No, you weren't.
I was. It was dumb to think that we could just pick up where we left off and act like nothing ever happened.
That's what I was going for.
Yeah, I know.
Because we both tend to act like we're fine when we're totally not.
We should stop.
Yeah.
We should.
We could help each other.
Talk about it.
Your dad... my mom...
That'd be good.
We do that and...
Who knows? We could...
Get normal?
Get better.
People call me a final girl, but we're all final girls in Lakewood.
And final boys.
Right, because we survived.
And, now, we're here to help each other find... find a way to get back to normal.
: The final thoughts of one of Lakewood's final kids.
This is Noah Foster and you're listening to The Morgue.
Holy frack! That was brilliant!
Good, because that's all you're going to get.
Uh, I didn't know what you would think about it. I hope it doesn't freak you out.
Audrey... hell, everyone thinks it's kind of obsessive.
Well, it kind of is.
Everybody has their way of dealing with what we went through.
Yeah.
Noah, what is this?
That's a pig farm.
Pretty sure it belongs to Troy James, Brandon's brother.
Weird. Where is it?
(Banging)
(Grunting, panting)
(Banging)
(Grunting)
Screw you, stupid lock!
(Panting)
(Suspenseful music playing)
No! No, please!
Please, no! No, no! No!
No! No!
Please! No!
(Engine stops)
Okay, this is not the mall, Em.
Well, I wasn't gonna tell Noah that I was having nightmares about a pig farm that belonged to the James family, and I was not coming here alone.
Yeah, but we couldn't have done this in the daylight?
Or tomorrow? Or, you know, never?
I just need to figure this out.
I'm just gonna take a quick look.
Make sure it's the same one from my dreams.
And then, we can go.
Promise.
(Laughing)
Emma, I just...
Brooke, I've had nightmares about this place since I was little.
I need to see it.
Wouldn't you?
No, actually.
Why am I dreaming about this place?
Okay, you wanted to see the creepy barn. You saw it.
Now, let's get out of here.
(Suspenseful music playing)
Is somebody living in that house?
(Machine whirring)
(Whirring stops)
What are you doing? No, no!
No! (Grunting) No!
It's not my time to die!
No! Die!
Screw you! Screw you!
No! No!
No, no, no!
(Suspenseful music playing)
(Phone vibrates)
(Suspenseful music playing)
: 
I think we could work together... teach them a lesson...
You and me... I don't even care if you're one of them...
They need to know what it's really like... We're outcasts... make them pay... Your friend, Audrey...
Your friend... Your friend... Your friend...
(Breathing heavily)
(Sighs)
(Ringtone playing)
: 
You and Piper had quite the thing going, didn't you, killer?
(Phone vibrates)
(Phone vibrates)
(Phone vibrating repeatedly)
(Suspenseful music playing)
Is anybody home?
Hello?
What are you doing? No, no, no.
(Sighs)
: Hello?
I'm sorry to barge in. I'm looking for Troy James.
(Floor creaking)
(Static)
(Suspenseful music playing)
(Creaking)
(Screams)
Emma!
