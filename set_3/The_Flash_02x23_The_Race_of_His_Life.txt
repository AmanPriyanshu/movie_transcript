Editor: 
Who are you?
My name is Jay Garrick.
Before I arrived on your Earth, I was in a fight with a man named Zoom.
He will do whatever it takes to ensure he's the only speedster in any world.
[growling] Never forget: I am the fastest man alive.
I get these feelings sometimes, these vibes.
I saw Jay. He's Zoom.
Who's the man in the iron mask?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
What do you say you and I give this a shot?
Yeah, I would like that.
I've always measured my success by counting the number of victims I've had.
But now I think I'm going to start counting the number of Earths I conquer instead.
Tell me I did not just see the end of the world.
Dad? No. No!
This is what's gonna make you just like me.
Jay? No!
No!
Dad?
Dad? Hey! Hey! Hey, look at me. Look at me. Dad.
Don't leave. Not again. Not again. Dad! Come on. Come on. Come on.
It's all right. No.
Dad.

[sobbing]
[choked] No, Dad.
I told you family was a weakness.
You feel the anger, don't you, Flash?
And now... the two of us are the same.
No! No!
There you go, Flash!
Use your anger, just like I did.

Henry suffered two great losses in his life.
He lost his wife, Nora, and he lost Barry.

Henry Allen was proof that love can get you through the darkest of days, and that love will keep him alive in all of our hearts.

Hey.
Hey.
I thought maybe you should eat something.
I'm not hungry. Thank you, though.
Yeah.
Barry, um...
I had no idea that you were The Flash.
What you did for me, all the things that you've done for everyone, this whole city...
And now this with your dad and Zoom.
I'm so sorry.
Thanks, Wally.
If there's anything you need, you just say the word.
All right.
Guys, Zoom's still out there.
We need to come up with a plan.
The man can crack open breaches to Earth-2.
I mean, if he can do that, what else can he do that we don't know about?
Right after he killed his time remnant, he told me I was "almost ready."
Almost ready for what?
I don't know.
Yep. Classic psychopath.
Why can't they ever just say what they want to do?
We also have to figure out why I keep vibing Earth-2 being ripped to shreds.
Seriously.
It's like I'm watching "Transformers" in 4-D, but, like, ten times more realistic and with much better acting.
Look, if you can vibe the future, we need to stop Zoom before that happens.
I'm gonna get some air, all right?
I got it.
When I was in the Speed Force, I felt like I'd finally come to grips with her death, with not saving her when I went back.
And then the moment... where I'm finally at the place I can move on, my father's taken from me.
How am I ever supposed to find peace with that?
I don't know, Barry, but you're gonna have to find a way to do that, or it's gonna tear you apart.
I just miss him so much already.
[whooshing]
Zoom.
Barry, no!
Bad time, Flash?
Thought I'd give you some time to mourn.
This ends now.
Not yet.
There's always more to take, Barry.
You're gonna stay away from them.
Well, that's completely up to you.
What?
When we first met, I told you that Zoom needed to be the best.
You just didn't realize I was talking about myself.
Is that what this is about?
A race, Barry, between you and me... to see who's the fastest.
You win: this is over, and you get to be the hero.
I'm not racing you.
Then your father won't be the only person you love that I'll take from you.
Think about it, Flash.
All I want to know is who's the fastest man alive on either world.
I'll be waiting.
[whoosh]
So Zoom wants to race you?
He's obsessed with being the best.
Why would we trust him?
He just wants to race.
You know, it actually makes sense in a completely-off-your-rocker sort of way.
That can't be everything he wants.
It isn't. This Magnetar that's being developed by Mercury Labs...
Turns out, it can act as a pulsar.
Whoa.
What is a pulsar?
Nah, that's not dangerous at all.
That's what happens to Earth-2.
What happens in my vibes is because of this machine.
That thing is powerful enough to destroy a planet?
A lot more than just a planet, if it has the right power source.
Like what?
Like me.
That's why he wants to race.
He wants to siphon the energy I create when I run.
He wants to siphon the energy off both of you.
When Jay captured me, he said that he used to measure his success by counting the number of victims he had, but now he was gonna measure it by counting the number of Earths he conquered instead.
He doesn't want to just destroy Earth-2; he wants to take out every other planet in the multiverse.
How many are there?
Infinite.
Yeah, well, he can do that?
If he can create a breach to Earth-2 all on his own...
He can get to all of 'em.
One pulse to destroy them all.
I guess I don't have a choice.
I have to race him.
And I have to win.
Bare.
Don't race him.
It's not that easy.
Yes, it is. You just say no.
We find another way to stop him, together, like we always do.
And do what, Joe?
Just sit around and wait for him to kill somebody else?
Wally? Iris? You?
No. No way.
He needs you, Bare.
He needs your speed again to get what he wants. We have the advantage here.
All I have to do is beat him, Joe.
That saves the multiverse, this whole city, all of you.
I won't let another person I love die when I can prevent it.
This... isn't just about racing Zoom, is it?
You want to kill this guy.
Of course I want to kill him, Joe.
I want to do a hell of a lot more than just kill him.
I want him to suffer for everything that he's done.
And he's going to.
Come on, Bare.
Think about what you're saying.
I have to be willing to do whatever it takes.
I'm sorry, but I'm racing him, whether you want me to or not.
