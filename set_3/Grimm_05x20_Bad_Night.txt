No. What is it?
It's a very dangerous organization.
The guy who broke into your house last night was one of them; he was going after Hank.
Oh, my God.
And we're afraid now they know about you and Hank, that you're the next target.
So pack whatever you can.
Enough for a week.
What? I can't just leave.
You are not safe here.
Hank'll be by in a half hour to pick you up.
I will be right outside in my car until then.
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay.
Just do not use your phone.
We can't assume that those are safe.
But I didn't do anything.
Unfortunately, knowing Hank is enough.
So lock the door behind me.
Do not open it again unless it's me or Hank.

Yeah?
We've got a problem.
Burkhardt is here, and he's taking me to a safe house.
Why?
Because of Hank.
They figured out that Tony was here for him.
Do they suspect you?
No, why would they be taking me to a safe house?
Now I'm supposed to pack for a week.
What do you want me to do?
Cooperate. Pack for a week and go.
That's enough for now.

So, I guess we didn't meet by accident.
I really felt something for you, Zuri.
Hank...
You unlocked the door.
No, I-I-I didn't, I...
Stop.
You unlocked the door and you gave Tony my phone.
You don't understand.
They made me do it.
Hank, I love you, but they threatened me, and my brother.
I just did what I had to do.
I love you, Hank.
I love you.
I'm so sorry.

Yeah, I'm sorry too.

Where am I?
Doesn't matter where you are.
What matters is what comes next.
"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood," and you cannot travel both.
So which is it gonna be?
Occultatum Libera.
Guess she chose the rough road.
Okay.
I'm going to get a cup of coffee.
She's all yours.
So you don't wanna talk.
Then I guess you won't be needing your mouth.

It doesn't get much better from here.
With 38% of the votes counted, Channel 8 has declared Sean Renard the new mayor of Portland in what appears to be a landslide.
Let's go live now to the Benson Hotel.
I'm told that Police Captain, and now Mayor-elect Sean Renard is on his way down and that he will be making a victory speech.
In fact, here he comes now.

Now, first and foremost, I would like to congratulate my opponent, Steven Gallagher, on a well-fought campaign.

No, no.
No, come on. I just got off the phone with Steven and he conceded and congratulated us.

That's right.
I want to thank you all, all of my supporters.
And to the people of Portland, those who voted for me, and those who did not, it is time for us to overcome our differences and to work together to make Portland an even greater city than it already is.
