(Gasps)
I didn't build our city.
I failed it.
No!
: This is your responsibility now.
My responsibility?
(Whoosh)
Aah! Aah!
You want survive? You kill.
To forge himself into a weapon.
: Mr. Queen!
: Oliver Queen is alive.
As something else.
What happened to you on that island?
How did you survive this?
What do you want? Aah!
I do what's necessary.
(Brakes screech)
You're no hero.
You're a killer.
There's more than one way to save this city.
: What makes you so sure I'm gonna help you?
Who needs two bullets in the chest?
: Are you ready to die?
 real 
Oh, my God.
In six months, the organization's vision will be complete.
And it would take everything...
You might just have a chance.
No, you can't!
Why should I trust you?!
You should make up your mind.
You have failed this city.

Season 2 Episode 00



Original Air Date on October 2, 2013
Oliver Queen is alive.
The Starling City resident was found by fishermen in the North China Sea.
(Reporters shouting at once)
Queen is the son of Starling City billionaire Robert Queen, who was also onboard but now officially confirmed as deceased.
When Oliver Queen returned home 
The Oliver you lost might not be the one they found.
: Okay, what else did you miss?
Super Bowl winners--giants, Steelers, Saints, Packers.
A black president--that's new.
What was it like there?
(Water lapping)
Cold.
Walter and I are married.
And I don't want you to think that either one of us did anything to disrespect your father.
Where did you get these?
Thank you, daddy's A.C.L. tear.
Ollie!
No one's called me that in a while, Speedy.
Worst nickname ever.
My brother and my father died.
I went to your funeral.
You can't come back here and judge me, especially for being just like you.
 me--the best I could do with what I had to work with.
So what'd you miss the most?
Steaks at the Palm?
Drinks at the Station?
Meaningless s*x?
Laurel.
Everyone is happy you're alive.
You wanna see the one person who isn't?
Hello, Laurel.
Hunt has an army of lawyers, and they are ready to bury us.
You and I against many.
I love those odds.
Why do you hate me?
Laurel was tough.
Why are you here, Ollie?
To apologize.
I never meant-- she was my sister.
(Sara screaming)
Sara!
Aah!
Sara!
I couldn't grieve because I was so angry.
That's what happens when your sister dies while screwing your boyfriend.
It should've been you.
I'd hoped that you'd rot in hell a whole lot longer than five years.
No! No! Help!
Dad, she's out there!
She's not there!
She's gone.
Did you even try to save her?
Did you even try to save my daughter?
: Okay, let's go, partner.
Fine.
Let's go.
(Clears throat)
How much do you know about your own so-called friends over here?
Well, I guess they never told you that they've been screwing while you were gone.
Look, man, I--
Tommy...
It's okay.
What the hell?!
(Thud)
Mr. Queen!
(Taser crackles)
Did he make it to the island?
Did he tell you anything?
(Crackling)
Uhh! Aah!
(Robert grunts)
I'm not the man you think I am.
I didn't build our city.
I failed it.
(Groans)
Did you father survive that accident?
(Exhales deeply)
Make it home.
Make it better.
Right my wrongs.
But you gotta live through this first.
Survive.
(Gasps)
No!
(Gunshot)
What did he tell you, Mr. Queen?
He told me I'm gonna kill you.
But he couldn't allow anyone to 
Nobody can know my secret.
(Bones crunch)
Aah!
(Thud)
It was his dying wish that Oliver would make them pay 
Five years on the island of Lian Yu had prepared him mentally and physically.
It would his mission to rid his city, one by one, of those who were using their powers to destroy it.
You remind Grell, I put him on the bench, I can take him off.
I will turn him into a cautionary tale.
Yes, Mr. Hunt.
And this attorney--
(electricity crackles)
Uhh!
Get in the car!
He needed to live in the shadows.
He would have to become someone else... something else.
You're gonna transfer $40 million by 10:00 p.m. tomorrow night.
Or what?
Or I'm gonna take it, and you won't like how.
(Slaps hand)
He was wearing a hood.
A green hood.
And he had a bow and arrow.
We'll put out an A.P.B. on...
Robin Hood.
He said he would be back here by 10:00 p.m.
Make sure you're here first.
He's never gonna get in.
(Electricity powers down)
(Elevator bell dings)
Uhh! Uhh!
You missed.
Really?
(Metal clanks)
(Helicopter whirring overhead)
Tell me you saw that.
Untraceable?!
It is $40 million!
Find it!
(Exhales deeply)
How did he do it?
But Oliver never imagined the extent of the disease... or just how far it had spread.
My son knows nothing.
You know, Robert didn't tell him anything that could hurt us.
And he has no idea that the yacht was sabotaged.
: Who's that?
Where'd he come from?
Working from his father's list, Oliver Queen systematically took down 
Please! No, please!
Marcus Redmond, you failed this city.
Please don't! Please don't!
Aah! Aah!
You're gonna testify in that trial.
You're gonna confess to having Victor Nocenti killed.
Please, no! Aah!
This guy gets more airtime than the Kardashians.
This city used to be different.
People used to feel safe.
Afraid we're gonna be next?
(Siren wailing)
Freeze!
Bow down, hands up.
(Clank)
A modern day Robin Hood.
Jason Brodeur.
Adam Hunt.
Warren Patel.
Tell me you see a connection, Moira.
He's not targeting the rich.
No, he's not.
He's targeting the list.
I miss Tequila!
(Cheering)
 Bratva, 
And after earning their trust...
Pleased to meet you.
 about the criminal underground.
I felt closer to you when you were dead.
Look, I know it was hell where you were, but it was hell here, too.
You gotta let me in, Ollie.
You gotta let 
 in.
: Oliver.
I wanna introduce you to someone.
: What do I call you?
: Diggle's good.
So...
You're ex-military?
Yes, sir.
105th Airborne out of Kandahar. Retired.
I don't want there to be any confusion, Mr. Queen.
My ability to keep you from harm will outweigh your comfort.
(Car door opens and closes)
(Car horns honk, tires screech)
(Gunshot)
Aah!
(Woman screams)
Uhh!
(Thud)
After saving his bodyguard's life, Oliver decided it was time to let him in on his secret.
You're that vigilante.
Starling City is dying.
It is being poisoned by a criminal elite who don't care who they hurt.
And what are you gonna do?
Take 'em all down by your lonesome?
No, I want you to join me.
Here's the security footage from the Exchange building shooting.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?
Wait, go back 10 seconds.
What is that?
(Taps button)
I'll be damned.
: What the hell is going on?!
: What's happening?!
Oliver Queen, you're under arrest on suspicion of obstruction of justice, aggravated assault...
What?!
Acting as a vigilante, and murder.
Who's your attorney, Mr. Queen?
Dinah Laurel Lance, Your Honor.
You hate the hood and you hate Oliver, and you want more than anything for them to be the same person.
Are you the man in this picture?
No.
 did 
I didn't want to talk about what happened to me on the island because the people that were there tortured me.
(Gasps)
How did you survive this?
There were times when I wanted to die.
(Gasps)
In the end, there was something I wanted more.
You don't--
Laurel, you don't have to go.
From Diggle as the vigilante.
An arms dealer was attacked across town tonight by the vigilante.
In light of that, all charges against your son are being dropped.
Thank you.
Ow! Uhh!
Variable acceleration.
Fighters work at the same pace.
You switch it up, throw your opponent off his game.
That was nice.
Where'd you learn that?
His name was Yao Fei.
(Thunderclap)
He soon discovered...
Aah! Aah!
First he met Yao Fei...
(Speaks indistinctly)
Also on the island?
Do you know what this island is named?
Lian Yu.
Mandarin for "Purgatory""
Aah!
He sent him to meet another ally.
(Gasps) Twitch and I will open your throat.
(Strained voice)
Yao Fei sent me here, and I'm pretty sure it wasn't so you could kill me.
Everybody is in this life for themselves.
Learn that at Australian spy school?
No. I learned that here.
You have no skill, no strength, no training.
I told you, I'm not a soldier.
Aah!
(Laughs)
Aah!
(Panting)
There might be a fighter inside of you after all.
You know, one of these days, you're gonna be straight with me about what really happened on that island.
Absolutely.
Aah!
Aah!
But not today.
Felicity Smoak?
Queen Consolidated's I.T. superstar.
I was at my coffee shop surfing the web, and I spilled a latte on it.
These look like bullet holes.
My coffee shop is in a bad neighborhood.
So a friend of mine is running a scavenger hunt.
I first need to get through this.
This is a military-grade cryptographic security protocol.
My buddy Kevin is starting an energy drink company.
Could you please do a spectral analysis?
If it's an energy drink, why is it in a syringe?
I ran out of sports bottles.
I was hoping you could look into something for me.
Discreetly.
I'm your girl.
It was information too dangerous to hold.
: Let me talk to him.
I think we're past the point of conversation, Moira, which means something must be done about it.
: Please help me welcome Mr. Malcolm Merlyn.
He was also Tommy's father.
My wife would've liked you, Laurel.
Their relationship was complex.
Well, I wish I would've known her.
She passed away before Tommy and I became friends.
She was killed, Laurel.
There's no need to be polite about it.
Secrets he would do anything to protect.
(Grunts)
: It's done.
And he won't be harmed?
Nor will he ever discover your involvement. You have my word.
What's done is done.
No, Moira.
It's just beginning.
(Man, modulated voice)
We must send a message.
(Arrows whoosh)
(Squish)
But when he drew Oliver into a fight, his purpose was curiously specific.
I know about the list, and the man who authored it wants you dead!
Aah!
Uhh! Aah! Uhh!
Oliver knew he was dealing with 
The other archer told me that somebody compiled the list.
I always assumed it was my father.
I think there's someone else out there, someone who's more of a danger than the archer.
And I am gonna take him down.
Leo Mueller, you have failed this city.
Maybe you can make a difference if you think beyond the scope of those pages.
I'm sure your father wouldn't mind.
No, you don't get it.
My father died so that I could live.
Every name that I cross off this list honors that sacrifice.
Oliver, there's more than one way to save this city.
Not for me.
It sounds like you have a narrow definition of being a hero.
I'm not a hero.
Aah!
Enjoy the fruits of your labor.
(Groans)
A family of thieves.
Drop your weapons!
I got this!
No! Uhh!
It wasn't his fault.
(Breathes heavily)
I turned my son into this.
If your dad could've seen you this week, the way you cared about the people he had hurt, the way you stepped up to try to help them...
I'd say he'd be pretty damn honored.
I can't imagine you want the death of an innocent young woman on your hands, not with your principles.
Aah!
: No!
Hey!
Uhh!
 to use as leverage against Yao.
No.
Let the girl go.
: Kill her!
No!
Shado, along with Slade Wilson, 
She coached him in skills she had learned from her father.
Showoff.
: Missile one locked on the jet's heat trail.
: Prepare to launch on my mark.
We need to reprogram the missile.
(Beeps)
(Missile whistling)
Let her go.
Uhh!
I got your message.
Is there a reason we can't do this face-to-face?
What's in here?
Leverage. Enough to help save Peter Declan's life.
As an attorney, I never would've gotten a file like this.
I always thought the law was sacred. You fixed everything.
Now what do you think?
I think there's too many people in this city who only care about themselves.
They need someone like you.
He's a damn criminal, and you've worked with him.
That makes you an accessory.
I am trying to save an innocent man's life.
No.
You're breaking the law.
So you met up with the hood guy? Knowingly?
Laurel, he's a murderer.
You sound like my father.
Well, I hate to break it to you, but he's right.
She's been working with the hood guy.
And there's some sort of infatuation thing going on here.
I-- fix this.
Before it becomes something that's unfixable.
Hi.
Hi.
Can I trust you?
You've dropped some fairly ridiculous lies on me, and...
Yet I still feel like I can trust you.
You can trust me.
Then I have something to show you.
Where'd you get it?
From your stepfather.
He said it belongs to your mother.
This is your father's notebook.
He kept a list of all the people in Starling City who owed him favors.
I've been researching some of those names online, and, uh, they're not good people.
The only way to keep this family safe is for everyone in it to stop asking questions, including you, Oliver.
I made it clear to him persuasively that his plans endanger the undertaking.
I didn't have to make the usual threats.
: Excellent.
What's the Undertaking?
I don't know.
But with all this talk about threats, it can't be good.
What are you gonna do?
(Gasps)
Moira Queen, you have failed this city.
Please don't kill me.
Do you know anything about the Undertaking?
I am a mother.
Please don't take me from my children.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
(Siren wailing in distance)
(Car alarm chirps)
Whoa!
(Strained voice) I'm not gonna hurt you, Felicity.
How do you know my name?
Because you know my name.
Everything about you just became so unbelievably clear.
(Exhales)
: Excuse me.
Can you help me?
He's... really heavy.
: I should've taken him to a hospital.
Felicity, listen. Trust me.
He'll be fine.
He's been through a lot worse than this.
I was thinking all this would be more of a shock.
Oliver brought me a laptop riddled with bullet holes, had me trace the black arrow, and research a company involved in armored car heists.
I maybe blonde, but I'm not 
 blonde.
(Monitor beeping steadily)
I guess I didn't die. Again.
Cool.
The Glades is a notoriously rough side of Starling City...
Hey!
(Scoffs)
: I found the dirtbag.
His name is Roy Harper.
(Knocks on door)
: How'd you know where I lived?
A little thing called the Internet.
You know, you showed some real sac coming down here, the Glades in the middle of the night...
You must not know the value of a vintage purse.
Hey, can I give you some advice?
Stay out of the Glades.
Where's downtown at?
I-I-I don't know.
Maybe you can give us some directions.
Or better yet, some money.
(Panting) Ow.
You're bleeding!
Yeah, I know.
That's what happens when you get stabbed.
: This could sting a little.
Oh, don't tell me a tough gangbanger like yourself is afraid of a tiny little needle.
Well, just think about something else.
Like what? (Inhales sharply)
: I was waiting for this.
Waiting for what?
This is home, sweet home for me.
You either starve or you do things that mean you're lucky enough to make it to 21.
: Roy Harper?
Yeah?
Uhh!
Roy!
More on the story out of the Glades.
The kidnapper seems to have another victim.
You know him?
Uh, Roy. He's my friend. (Sniffles)
I promise you he's gonna be okay.
Felicity, show me a map...
(Taps key)
Of sites of the abductions and where we've seen the signal so far. (Typing)
Don't do it!
: I thought I was gonna die.
But you didn't.
Yeah, because of him.
I can't go back to the way things were, Thea.
I c-can't just go back to being nothing.
I can't explain it, but it feels like my life is connected to his.
I've seen that map before.
It's an old map of a decommissioned subway line.
It runs underneath the low-rent district of the city.
: It was right in front of our faces the entire time.
My father, the other archer, the Undertaking...
Whatever the plan is, it's all connected to the Glades.
: The Undertaking, which we set for ourselves, is only months from fruition.
There's hope on the horizon for everyone in Starling.
(Chuckles)
We won't fail this city.
And I think I speak for everyone here when I say we're all with you, Malcolm.
I wanna get out.
That's, uh, a lot to confide in me, Moira.
I've gone along with this for as long as I can stomach.
Frank Chen recommended you.
He said you could help us with our problem.
How can we be of assistance?
Malcolm Merlyn.
I want you to kill him for me.
(Malcolm, amplified voice)
The true humanitarian in the Merlyn family was my wife Rebecca.
I like to think that if the man who murdered her knew her, he would've helped her to her car, made sure she was safe, instead of stealing her purse and shooting her.
(Beep, alarm blaring)
(Smack)
Ladies and gentlemen, please exit calmly...
Tommy.
Come with me.
A fact that took his son by surprise.
Wait!
Let's go!
How did you know how to do that?
What?
Kill.
(Explosion)
(Rapid gunfire)
Dad!
(Gasping)
Stay back.
I'm not here to hurt you or your father.
I said stay back.
If you don't let me help you now, he's dead before anybody gets here!
Why should I trust you?!
'Cause you always have.
Oliver.
(Gasps and groans)
Dad. Oh.
Take it easy.
The Vigilante saved you.
He did?
But thanking him wasn't foremost in Tommy's mind.
I know you have a lot of questions.
Yeah.
(Inhales deeply)
Yeah, but for now, just the one.
Were you ever gonna tell me?
No.
 quickly grew to include Laurel.
When you first got home, I didn't think that you had changed much.
But you have, and...
It's nice to see.
(Whispers) Thank you.
(Thunderclap)
You still love her, don't you?
It doesn't matter how I feel, because of what I do, I could never be with her.
So you don't have anything to be afraid of.
She is 
 ever going to know my secret.
It doesn't matter.
She knows.
I know.
But if she ever found out who you really are...
She would choose you.
(Laurel whispering)
You can't be serious.
I'm not sure that I'm ready for the kind of commitment that you're looking for.
And I don't want to hurt you in the long run, so--
(voice breaks) You're lying.
I am not a liar.
If you've changed, and I know that you've changed, you would never do this.
Well, then I guess I haven't changed as much as we all thought then.
Will you please go talk to Tommy for me?
And say what?
Say that you and I are over, that you're not still in love with me.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Because it wouldn't be true.
: Thank you for coming, Frank.
Malcolm knows.
(Whispers) What?
I had no choice but to turn over what they've discovered... (Exhales deeply)
The money that you paid the Triad to assassinate him.
(Arrow whooshes)
The money I--
(Inhales sharply)
Moira!
Mr. Merlyn thanks you for your loyalty.
(Sobs)
You lied to me.
We had a deal!
You promised if I cooperated with the Undertaking, Walter wouldn't be harmed!
He hasn't been.
I'm a man of my word, Moira.
I think we both know better than that.
Turn on the camera.
Oh, Walter.
Like you said, Moira, we have an agreement.
Walter would stay in my custody until the Undertaking was complete.
We're both in this together.
She's working with Malcolm Merlyn.
And they're planning something.
Something...
Terrible.
Hey, mom.
Tell me the truth.
I don't know what you mean.
I think you do.
Couple of months ago, when I showed you Dad's notebook, you seemed to know something.
You need to stop asking these things.
I 
I 
 to know.
(Electricity powers down)
(Dart whooshes)
Oh.
Oliver.
(Dart whooshes)
Ohh.
(Breathes heavily)
Moira Queen, you have failed this city.
Please, do not hurt my son.
Tell me what the Undertaking is, and I won't have to.
: No! (Gasps)
Uhh!
No!
Malcolm is planning to level the Glades!
How?
There's a device.
He says that it could cause an earthquake.
Why would you get involved in something like this?
My husband.
He was lost. He...
His decisions left me vulnerable to Malcolm.
And I had no choice.
I had to protect my family and my children.
This device, where is it?
I don't know.
If you don't tell me, I can't stop Merlyn.
Oh, you can't stop him.
It's too late.
It's the Undertaking.
I was just treating the symptoms while the disease festered.
I stop the Undertaking, I wipe out the disease.
Merlyn's plan is what I returned from the island to stop.
For the past five years, under the threat for my life and the lives of my family...
I have been complicit in an undertaking with one horrible purpose-- to destroy the Glades and everyone in it.
The architect of this nightmare 
(Screams)
Yes, and I have proof that he has killed dozens in pursuit of this madness.
Is it true?
Did you kill all those people?
I did what I had to do.
Malcolm Merlyn, you are under arrest!
Don't move!
Dad, no!
Stay back.
I don't wanna hurt you.
You can't, and you can't stop me.
This red line here is a known fault that runs right below the Glades.
For about a mile, the fault runs underneath the old 10th Street subway line.
Dollars to doughnuts, the seismic device is somewhere along there.
(Cell phone chimes and buzzes)
I know were Merlyn is keeping the device.
I need someone I can trust to deactivate the device.
(Sirens wailing)
: Earlier today, Moira Queen, C.E.O. of...
(Man on TV speaking indistinctly)
: Proceed out of the Glades in an orderly manner.
Welcome, gentlemen.
I've been waiting for you.
I wanted to see you watch your city die.
Uhh! Aah!
Aah!
(Beeping)
(Gasps)
: You should see something that looks like a circuit board.
Okay.
Felicity talked Detective Lance 
Do you see a timer?
(Continues beeping)
7 minutes.
Okay.
Cut the blue one.
All right, I got it. I got it.
(Snips)
Oh!
(Whirring)
(Beeping resumes)
Holy God.
(Tires screech)
Roy!
Thea tracked down Roy Harper...
Roy, stop! Look!
(People screaming at once)
The device is about to go off any second!
I leave any of them behind.
Look, I-I know you said you have something to prove, but you're not the vigilante.
I can't do this unless I know you're safe.
Then you better haul ass out of here, too.
With chaos erupting everywhere, 
Don't struggle.
It's over.
Don't worry.
Your mother and sister will be joining you in death. (Groans)
Aah!
(Groaning)
(Beeping continues)
(Powers down)
: Oliver, Lance did it.
It's over.
If I've learned anything as a successful businessman, it's... (Exhales sharply)
(Coughs)
Redundancy.
(Groans)
(Electricity humming)
: There's another device.
There's two of them.
(Explosion)
Oliver Queen came back to right 
He couldn't have imagined how severe they were.
: Go. Go!
Uhh! Aah!
Laurel!
The damage seems to be contained on the east side.
Laurel.
Go. Go, go, go.
Please! Help me!
(Strained voice) Tommy.
What are you doing here?
I love you.
(Grunts) Go! Go!
I'm right behind you!
Dad!
No!
No, Laurel!
Come on. It's too late!
It's too late. (Sobbing)
(Speaks indistinctly)
Tommy.
(Whispering)
Is--is Laurel safe?
Is Laurel safe?
Yeah. You saved her.
I'm--I'm sorry.
(Voice breaks) No.
Don't apologize.
And--no.
Tommy. (Crying)
(Whispers) Open your eyes.
Something else yet again?
Perhaps something...
Better.
