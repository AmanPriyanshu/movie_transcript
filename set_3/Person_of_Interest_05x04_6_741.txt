Almost done.
Got my German Shepherd chipped.
Had a nasty habit of jumping the fence.
I'm afraid this attack dog is slightly more advanced.
Fortunately for us, so is our chip.
I should hope so.
Ms. Shaw has killed six of my men in the last nine months.
It appears the operation has been a success.
Sir, implanting an electronic microchip this close to her brain stem is incredibly risky--
Thank you, Doctor.
I expect Ms. Shaw to be much more accommodating from here on out.
Time to begin phase two.
Hi.
I'm Stewart.
You have beautiful eyes and gray matter.
If I was a zombie--
[slurping]
[chuckles]
A little humor to break the ice.
[clears throat]
Shall we?
Which one will it be, Sameen?
The choice is yours.
We'll start by asking you a few questions.
Do you remember your name, your mission?
What about the names of your Machine's acolytes?
They've compressed the Machine to its core code, hiding it somewhere.
Where would they go?
: Nothing.
I think that chip fried her brain.
There was a park you played in as a girl on the base in Qatar.
The playground had a roundabout.
The other kids loved to spin, but you got sick, so sick it made you angry.
One day you forced yourself to spin from sunup to sundown.
How many times did you retch that day?
There isn't much that gets a rise out of you, is there?
All right, then, let's play a game.
Joseph Kent, firefighter.
He pulled you out of the twisted wreckage that claimed your father's life.
Tell me, is Kent dead or alive?
Dead.
Multiple myeloma, rare bone cancer.
Sadly, not rare enough.
Dead or alive?
Come on, take a look.
Agent Cole, your old partner, dead.
Mm.
I'm starting to see a pattern.
Dead... or... alive?
Did you come up with this game all by yourself, or did it tell you to bore me to death?
Well, if it were up to me, I'd have abandoned you long ago like your so-called friends.
First thing I'm gonna do when I get out of these straps... is make you bleed.
Promises, promises.
Afraid our chip didn't take.
Our pet goes under the knife again.
And if she becomes a slobbering vegetable?
A little brain damage is a small price to pay if we can turn Ms. Shaw into a valuable asset.

Please, Sameen!
Whatever it is you're hiding, it's wedged between your radius and your ulna.
A USB drive.
Didn't you say we're in a Faraday cage, Finch?
Let's plug it in.
The USB's heavily encrypted, but I broke through long enough to get a glimpse of a familiar code.
So you know the code?
I know the author.
An old associate, Arthur Claypool, Samaritan's forefather.
I believe this code is a kill switch.
A unique string of characters that will obliterate our rival once this USB is plugged into a networked device.
But we won't know for sure until I crack this encryption.
So keep typing!
