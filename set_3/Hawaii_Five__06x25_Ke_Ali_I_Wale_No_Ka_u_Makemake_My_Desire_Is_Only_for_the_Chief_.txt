Come on, Raintree, tell me the truth: when you were flying those commercial buses, how many times you fall asleep on the job, huh?
You give a man a hot meal, a comfy chair, an autopilot...
I defy anyone not to take a nap.

Yeah, I like flying, buddy.
That's why I like this.
Less sleeping, more piloting.

Turn around.
Commander, you understand why this was necessary.
Yeah. Yeah.
You don't want me to know I'm at a CIA black site in Morocco.
Come on, boys.
17 hours on a C-5 Galaxy, the smell of saffron and cumin as we drove through the market, the call to prayer from the minaret, and then one of your drivers was speaking in Berber to his wife, apologizing for something he said last night.
I just hope that whatever you got on the other side of this door is worth it.
: Come... closer.
So, you do know who I am.
You have your mother's eyes.
And her resolve, so I'm told.
Why am I here?
: 
For killing Wo Fat?
Yeah.
He said he understood.
Said that his son's obsession with revenge was his ultimate undoing.
Huh.
Mmm.
So you-you flew all that way for a fortune cookie quote?
They don't got phones in Morocco or what?
Clearly, it was important to this old man that he looked me in the eye when he said what he had to say.
Did he mention Doris?
Yeah.
Yeah, he mentioned Doris, briefly.
The fact that she looked after his son for as long as she did, whether it was out of guilt or pity or-or a sense of duty... he said he was grateful for that.
(footsteps approaching)
: Steve. Steve!

Sorry, Commander, he just went right by my desk.
No, it's okay, I-I know him.
Thanks. I got it, Chief, I got it.

Nahele, what's wrong?
: C.O.D. was respiratory failure brought on by acute methamphetamine overdose.
I'm waiting for toxicology, but I suspect they will merely confirm what seems to be painfully obvious: that this is yet another victim of the same batch of fentanyl-cut crystal, making him the 11th victim in the last two weeks alone.
This thing's an epidemic.

So... the stuff you've been putting in your body, it's cut with a powerful opiate called fentanyl, and most of the people who've been using it, they don't live to try it again.
I guess that makes me special, doesn't it?
No, it makes you lucky.
You're alive because of dumb luck.

Yeah, it, uh... it was not what I expected, I'll tell you that.
You know, if he was kept off the grid for 40 years, how did he even know that you were the one who killed his son?
I have no idea.
But his handlers monitored the meet, and, uh, I don't know, it was clear to me that I was just there to listen.
So I take it you never even got a chance to ask him if he knows where your mother is?
No.
But what I did get from the conversation is that he has not seen Doris for, at least, a couple of decades, and... the people detaining him are making sure those two don't connect.
Well... forgiveness is the last thing I would ever expect from that bloodline, so... trust me-- take it, move on.
Well, it worked for you and Abby, right?
Well, seeing as she's back in San Francisco getting her things, uh... yeah, I guess you could say that.
How do you feel about that?
Well, let's just say I'm getting used to the idea that I'm gonna have a lot more throw pillows in my life.

We read you. Go ahead.
This is, this is Detective Danny Williams with the Five-O task force.
I need help landing this plane.
You're a cop?
Hey, put down the gun!
You put yours down!
Put down... the gun-- I'm not gonna ask you again.
Not gonna happen.
It's really bad.
Hang on...
: Mayday request, do you copy?
Please switch to channel 17 for immediate assist.
Don't you answer that.
If I don't answer it, we're gonna die, both of us.
Either we shoot each other or this plane goes down-- you understand that?
: Mayday request, do you copy?
Please switch to channel 17 for immediate assist.
Stay awake.
Steve... (muttering)
All right, you know what?
You know what?
 shoot me-- go ahead-- but who's gonna fly this plane?
Uh, well, apparently you can't fly it, either.
That's true, but the people on the other end can, all right?
You want to shoot me, come sit in my lap, be my guest! Do it, all right?
Huh?
Look...
I promise you...
I land this plane safely, you and I will pick up right where we left off, okay?
All right?!
Huh?!
Fine.
All right, good.
Steve...
Switching to channel 17.
You're all right, Steve.
I'm gonna die, Danny.
No, you're not. Just hang in there.
You're gonna be all right, all right?
Again, this is Detective Danny Williams.
I'm headed your way.
Our pilot, my colleague, has been shot.
He's got multiple gunshot wounds.
I need EMT standing by right when we get this thing on the ground, which I have no clue, zero clue how to do.
Over.
: 
We just need to slow you down a little.
Okay, all right, slow us down-- h-how do I do that?
Between you and the pilot Steve. are three pull levers.
The furthest to the left is your throttle.
Push it down to 25%.
: 
Good. Now keep both hands on the control.
Check your level. Dead center to the pilot.
Make sure you don't dip below the horizon line.
And keep your compass heading between north and the number three.
Okay, north and number three-- got that.
Buddy...?
Oh, no!
Steve...?
All-all right, 
I need you to do something for me, all right?
You focus on getting the plane down-- do not talk to me!
Listen, do what I-- do what I tell you to do or I'm gonna drop this thing in the water-- you understand?
What do you want?
I want you to put your hand on his neck, and tell me if you feel a pulse, okay?
I-I don't know!
What do you mean, you don't know?
Keep your hand on his neck!
Either you feel a pulse or you don't!

Uh, Control, I got, I got an alarm, and I don't know what it is.
Check your gauges-- what do you see?
What do I see? What do I see?
I see a lot of gauges!
What's your airspeed?
Uh, air-airspeed is 155.
What about altitude?
(quietly): Altitude...
Altitude's 500, but falling.
Fuel?
Fuel... no good.
Uh, needle's right at zero.
All right, you're running out of fuel.
We need to get you down as soon as possible.
Yeah. Well, it's fine-fine with me.
The Coast Guard has been notified.

Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What does he mean by "ditch"?
I don't know.

Somebody attacked our transport mid-flight.
Steve's been shot.

He said we have to ditch.
Yeah, well, we're not ditching.

 is a large red handle.
Pull it to feather your prop.
Don't try to fight gravity.
Uh-huh, large red handle.
All right, Detective, next to the radio controls are your landing gear settings.
There's a switch labeled "up water."
Flip it.
Lower your flaps one more peg to the landing position.
(flaps clanking)
Okay.
Okay, done.
Now you're gonna have to put her down on the water.
Adjust your course 
Ah...
Ah...
All right, uh, control, that's not gonna work, okay?
My partner, he's... he's unconscious.
If I put this thing down on the water, I'm not gonna be able to get him out of the plane and he's gonna drown.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I-I-I got a choice.
I-I'm gonna put this thing down on the beach, okay?
Detective, we strongly advise against that.
(sirens wail, engines rev)
: Your best chance of survival is a water landing.

I'm putting this thing down on the beach, okay?
Clear the beach, I'm coming in.

Hello.
What is it?

It's Steve.
Come on.
Hey, Doc, what's going on?
I'm afraid it's not good news.
Commander McGarrett has suffered a devastating trauma to his liver.
A bullet has cut it into multiple fragments, making the entire organ inoperable.
If he doesn't receive a new liver in the next few hours, he will die.
Uncle Steve was hurt pretty bad.
The doctor says he needs a new liver.
But they said there's not enough time to wait to find a donor either on the Island or in the mainland.
I'm in.
Me, too.
Same here.
: We can certainly run some tests and determine which, if any, of you are the correct tissue match for Commander McGarrett.
Let me, um, just save everybody some time.
Uh, Steve and I are the same blood type.
Um, so just-- let's use mine.
Doesn't my dad need his liver?
You know, I didn't know this, but the liver is actually an amazing organ.
It can completely regenerate.
So, they're gonna take half of your father's liver and give it to Uncle Steve, and then, in time, both livers will grow to normal size.
: 
Let's just go in there and get it over with, huh?
Okay.
All right?
Will do.
Thanks, Doc.
Hey, what are you doing, Monkey?
(groans)
Hey.
You know I got a broken rib, right?
What are you doing, huh?
What are you upset for?
Everything's gonna be all right. I promise.
Wipe those tears away.
What are you doing?
(sighs)
: Hey.
How are you holding up?
First you, and now McGarrett.
I'm just tired of us getting shot at.

Nothing?

Sometimes we would talk, other times, we wouldn't say much of anything.
And this went on for weeks.
Now, he never said anything to anybody.
He never mentioned it.
This was something he did because he knew I couldn't bear to be alone.

You didn't save my life, Steve.
You were on the wrong side of the plane when we got shot at.
Okay? That's "A."
"B", there is zero chance, if the roles were reversed here, you'd be giving me a piece of your liver, okay? No chance.
How can you say that?
You sayin' I'm not generous that way?
No, you're not generous.
I've never even seen you take your wallet out of your pocket.
There's no way you're giving me one of your vital organs.
Oy...
If this liver comes with your negative attitude, I swear to God I'm gonna cut it out myself.
That's crazy. That's crazy.
It's not like I'm asking for a "thank you," Steve.
(turns up volume on TV)
I'm not saying give me a speech or a gift or anything like that, but you... you're just... you're a big, giant ingrate.
You know?
My son, who I gave bone marrow to, he was more grateful than you are.
But come to think of it, he's four years old and he's more emotionally mature than you, so it makes complete and total sense.
He's a kid.
I promise you, Danny, you give him time, he's gonna grow up to hate you just as much as I do.
Okay, that's enough.
: 
I know you can still hear me.
