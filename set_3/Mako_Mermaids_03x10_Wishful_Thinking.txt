Come in.
Hey.
Here's the research you wanted.
All this for one chemistry project?
You said you wanted help.
Can we go to the cafe?
I would like to eat something this month.
: Yeah, you coming, Zac?
Uh, I'm hanging out with Evie today.
If I can tear myself away from this.
Hey, cheer up.
Where's that famous Zac Blakely smile?
I didn't have chemistry projects when I was 12.
What's this?
I found it on the reef this morning.
Oh, it's beautiful. I've never seen anything like it before.
Oh, school used to be a breeze. I played all the time.
Life was pretty good as a kid.
I wish you could have seen me then.
Guys?
Cam, get here quick.
There are three girls in my room!
Guys?
Where did Zac go?
How do you know my name?
 You're Zac?
Yes.
Just like the photo.
How did you do that?
Do what?
: You just appeared... out of nothing.
Who are you?
We're... aliens.
Zac?
Are you getting ready? For Evie's party?
Yeah.
I left a card with the present, did you see it?
Yeah.
Is everything all right, darling?
Yeah.
We're leaving in an hour.
You are aliens!
Cam, hurry up!
Get over here!
We need to get out of here.
Can someone explain what's going on?
I have no idea.
Why is Zac so young?
Did we do that to him?
It's almost like we time traveled.
That's ridiculous.
We have to find Rita.
Where are the girls?
They're not just girls, Cam.
They're aliens.
Come on, Blakely.
I race over here, expecting to see girls... then you tell me they're aliens?
They're aliens who look like girls.
So they just look like girls... or they are girls?
Which is it?
I-- I don't know.
Maybe they're girls and aliens at the same time.
As if. I've got a party to get ready for.
Wait!
They might come back.
You have to see them, Cam.
Act your age, Blakely.
Only little kids believe in aliens.
: Have you got a better explanation?
: Time travel is a fantasy.
Let's just find Rita and sort this out.
What are you doing here?
Rita, something weird is happening.
Who are you?
How did you get in here?
: We swam in... like we always do.
Veridia sent you, didn't she?
What?
No.
I knew she'd send someone. I didn't expect three hatchlings.
What are you talking about?
Veridia didn't send us.
You can tell her my mind is made up.
I'm staying here, on land.
I don't understand.
It's simple.
This is my home... and right now I have work to do at school, so tell Veridia I'm not coming back to the pod.
Ever.
Now go.
No. We live here, with you.
You live here with me?
: Yeah.
You and Poseidon.
Poseidon?
Your fluffy, white cat?
I don't have a cat.
But, Rita--
Go!
And don't come back!
It makes sense.
Zac's a kid.
Rita's younger.
Okay.
So we've traveled back in time.
How?
The seashell!
It glowed, there was a flash of light, and then we arrived here.
You're right.
It must have some kind of magical power over time.
I dropped it in Zac's room.
What are we waiting for?
Wait.
We have to be careful around Zac.
He's a kid.
Ever heard of the butterfly effect?
If we interfere with the past... it could alter the future beyond recognition.
We don't have a choice.
Hey, Zac! You want a juice?
Uh, sure. 
 Sure.
Have you seen Mimmi?
Who?
Ondina?
Weilan?
You know, the mer--
 The mermaids.
 Sorry. I wish I had, though.
If mermaids were real, I would definitely want to meet one.
What do you mean, "if"?
You sure have a wild imagination.
What happened to the aliens?
What aliens?
You tell me.
Have you seen Evie?
Yeah, I think she's on the beach.
Hey, don't you want that juice?
: Cam!
: Take over, will you?
Man, am I happy to see you!
Whoa, there, Blakely.
Three paces at all times. People might be watching.
So what's up?
I-- I've been having the weirdest day ever.
 Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
See another UFO, did you?
Impending alien invasion?
What?
You know those big metal things up in the sky?
They're called airplanes.
Hey, Evie.
Hey.
Evie!
You're with Cam?
Chicks love a man in uniform. 
I knew you'd come back.
I can't see it.
Oh, Cam's going to be sorry he missed you.
Don't worry, I didn't tell anyone else.
Can you show me your spaceship?
Put a clam in it and give us the seashell!
What seashell?
There is a shiny seashell here, Zac, that is important.
We need it to get home.
But you just got here.
Hand it over or I will zap you into outer space.
Ondina!
Are you sure you haven't seen the shell?
I...
Um...
Got it. Let's go.
Please, you can't leave now!
Meeting you was the coolest thing that's ever happened to me.
: Zac? Are you ready?
You should go.
: Zac, hurry up!
We were never here, right?
You shouldn't have been so hard on him.
We got the shell, that's what matters.
It won't matter at all unless we figure out how it works.
Ms. Santos.
Ms. Trumble.
Working on a Saturday, are we?
It's good to see such dedication in the junior staff.
I'll be keeping an eye on you when I'm in charge.
In charge?
The school board is interviewing me for the position of principal.
Oh.
Really?
Well, the interview is merely a formality, of course.
I'm perfect for the job. They know that.
Actually, I... was thinking of applying.
Rita! We need to talk to you.
Right now.
If you don't mind.
 How dare you follow me to my place of work?
You have no right.
Rita, you have to listen to us.
We're from the future.
It's true. We live with you, five years from now.
 All right.
If you know me in the future, prove it.
You like seaweed cordial.
Every mermaid likes seaweed cordial.
You're the principal here.
Excuse me?
You're the principal of this school.
How could you possibly know that?
I only decided to apply for that position this morning.
Like we said... we're from the future.
Time travel?
How is that even possible?
Well, it doesn't happen every day.
Show her the seashell.
This is a wishing shell.
They're incredibly rare.
I've heard of them, but this is the first one I've seen.
Tell me exactly what happened.
We were with our friend, Zac, looking at a photo of him when he was younger.
He said...
"I wish you could have seen me then."
When Zac made that wish, the shell made it come true.
By sending us back to Zac's childhood.
If it's a wishing shell, let's wish ourselves home.
Hmm.
: It's not that easy.
If Zac found the shell, then he controls it.
It has to be his choice to wish you back.
And if he doesn't want to?
Then... you can never return.
Morning, Zac.
We're going shopping.
Is there anything you want?
Mum, Dad, I am so glad to see you.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Okay, something very strange is happening.
I know this is going to sound weird, but...
The guy in this picture, he's not me.
I mean, I mean, he looks like me... but it's not me. You can see that, right?
Zac, are you feeling all right?
Look... I woke up this morning and everything was normal.
Then, all of a sudden, something happened and now I'm in some kind of alternate reality where everything is different.
 None of this is real!
Is everything all right at school?
: Rita?
Hello? Rita?
Rita?
Enjoying your party, Evie?
It's great, Dad. Thanks.
These are delicious, Mr. McLaren.
Zac!
I was hoping you'd come.
Happy birthday, Evie.
Thanks.
: Ah, back again.
You want that juice now?
Where's Rita?
Rita?
Our school principal, Ms. Santos. Where is she?
She moved overseas years ago.
Everyone knows that.
Something on your mind?
You wouldn't believe me. 
I know people give you a hard time about your strange theories, but I agree with you.
There are so many mysteries in this world. More than we realize.
What would you say if I told you I come from an alternate reality?
Come on, Zac.
That's a bit extreme... even for you.
How long have I been obsessed with aliens?
Oh, ever since... Evie's 12th birthday party.
: Everything all right out here?
It's great, Dad.
Terrific.
Well, I'll pop inside and decorate the cake.
Wouldn't be a birthday party without a cake.
Go away.
You got your seashell.
I wasn't very nice to you before.
I'm sorry.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
We need your help.
: Really?
These are the girls?
These are the aliens... and they need my help.
Aliens?
Yeah.
Zac said he had aliens in his bedroom.
They don't look much like aliens to me.
They are aliens!
Show them!
Do your disappearing trick!
Blakely's finally lost it.
Please!
What disappearing trick?
Let me talk to him.
Hi, ladies. I'm Cam.
You can call me the Camster.
Leave me alone.
I'm sorry I embarrassed you, Zac.
Aliens have to keep a low profile.
But we really do need your help.
Why?
Well, because, you're special.
No, I'm not.
Well, you're special to me.
See, we're not just aliens.
We're from the future... and in the future, you and I are really good friends.
As close as brother and sister.
So what?
Everyone here thinks I'm crazy.
Even Evie.
Hmm.
I might be able to do something about that.
Can I freshen that drink?
How old are you?
Twelve.
But my mum tells me I look a lot older.
How about a dance?
 Maybe later.
Can I have everyone's attention?
I understand that there are some of you here who don't believe in aliens.
My friends and I are, in fact, from a distant planet and shall now prove it.
 What are you doing?
Trust me.
What planet are you from?
A planet where the laws of gravity are upside-down... and everything floats.
: Whoa!
That's amazing.
Look at that.
Weilan.
Whoa!
Catch.
That's amazing.
: How did you do that?
They're not aliens.
It's just a magic trick.
Plastic balls on wires.
And now a special gift from Zac to Evie, the birthday girl.
Awesome present, Zac!
Ready?
If this doesn't work, you guys will be doing kids parties for the rest of your lives.
It's amazing.
What do you want me to do?
This is a magical wishing shell.
Just say, "I wish things back the way they were."
Then we'll be able to go back home.
But I don't want you to go.
I meant what I said earlier, Zac.
You and I will meet again in the future.
Promise?
Promise.
Okay.
I wish things back the way they were.
 School used to be a breeze.
I played all the time.
 Life was good as a kid.
I wish you could--
Be careful what you wish for.
Did I miss something?
: Do you feel all right?
: Uh...
Yeah.
No memory of anything weird happening just now?
No.
What's going on?
Hey.
: Hey.
So, what's the plan?
Cam and Carly are going to a movie.
Open invite.
That sounds great.
Do you guys want to come?
It's a sci-fi.
I think we'll pass.
There you are.
Oh. Hey, Evie.
I've been looking for you.
What are you doing here?
It... it's weird.
I can't remember.
We're cutting the cake. I didn't want you to miss it.
I'm really glad you came, Zac.
Me, too.
Come on.
