: 
(SHERMAN SHRIEKS)
Reach out and take it. Take the apple.
:
Mr. Ryan, would you please step back to your podium?
She wouldn't take the apple.
Which one of you Johnny Appledick sh1t for brains came up with that bit?
Hi, ma'am, I just arrived here in Winter Blunderland.
: 
I think we've identified the key problem, which is that Jonah does not interact well with humans.
No, I don't interact well with hag-ass old bitches.
Do you realize that you just handed O'Brien New Hampshire chained to a radiator with its twat shaved?
I'm sorry, Mom.
You know what? On the positive side, now I can just try and concentrate on our little family weekend.
Just us Meyers.
Well, then why is Gary here?
I mean, no offense.
Oh, thank you.
I'm just really excited to have this time for you and Dad and Monny to get to know the real Marjorie.
I mean, fun Marjorie, not just Marjorie the Secret Service agent.
: 
When is she arriving?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
I'm just kidding. I'm just teasing.
Whoo-hoo-hoo! The president is driving.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
: Look out.
Bump. How about that?
Look!
Dad! Monny!
Kitty Cat!
All right, so the Chinese are gonna be here any minute.
Yeah.
Beijing has demanded complete secrecy.
So you're gonna have to keep Charles Ponzi and pussyride away from me.
We Meyers are very resourceful.
You do know you're not really a member of my family, right?
I do.
Right.
: 
 you're putting all over the tree, Monica?
Oh, this is my homemade cranberry and popcorn tinsel that I like to call...
(GASPS) Popcornaments!
Someone's been reading my blog.
I just trademarked the word last week.
It sounds delicious and it's adorable.
So I'm gonna call it delorable.
See? We can all do it.
Hey, Mom.
Yes?
I just wanted to let you know that Marjorie is a raw food vegan and she's turned me into one.
Oh, so that's two things she's turned you into.
Yeah, we just thought maybe we could have, like, a sham ham for Christmas.
What is that, sweetie? Is that like tofurkey?
No, ma'am, tofurkey is cooked.
This is a raw log made of mushrooms and soaked walnuts.
But it tastes like a ham?
Yeah, it's close.
Not at all.
We could all cut back on our meat consum...
I'm terribly sorry, Marjorie.
I thought you were Selina.
That's okay, sir.
People make that mistake constantly.
How about you touch neither of us?
Okay, I'm gonna go check on that funky food order and...
Mom, I wanted to ask you about something, but I can just talk to Dad about it.
He's better with money stuff.
What money stuff?
Well, it's just that there's so much of it 
Uncle George was saying that maybe I should sell the Palm Beach house so that I could pay off the estate taxes.
Palm Beach house, honey? That was my daddy's favorite house.
Actually, Lee, right now is a fantastic time to sell.
And, Catherine, do you remember that Brazil hotel chain?
What?
 and they decided to convert the whole thing to an eco resort.
No, they didn't.
I have a prospectus in my briefcase.
I'll tell you what. I think we should not talk about money during our sort of pre-Christmas Christmas celebration.
Catherine and Marjorie, can you gals go outside and get some wood to start a fire?
Ma'am, your daughter's dazzling eyes can start a fire themselves.
Okay, well, that's terrifying, but I actually do think we need to get some wood from outside.
Yes, ma'am.
Thanks. Gary, we got to go.
Okay, are the Chinese here yet?
Delayed on the road, ma'am.
Presumably driving slowly and not using their signals.
Hey, any updates on Debralee's sonogram?
Nothing. I'm going crazy.
What do you got going there, Depravey Crockett?
You can't go in with a plan. The knife tells you.
Okay, so lay it on me, Ben.
It's all been prenegotiated, ma'am.
In exchange for you lifting the sanctions, 
 and an engine assembly plant in North Carolina.
Okay, so we got North Carolina, Ohio.
That's the presidency for me.
And as per usual, we raised the issue of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama returning to Tibet.
Dalai Lama, I'm so sick of him.
He's insufferable.
Do we have a press release ready to go, Mike?
All I got to do is press send and we... actually, I do need to spell-check this thing.
Ma'am, Minna HÃ¤kkinen is through security and headed this way.
How is it that that Asperger salad inserted herself into this situation?
President Lu trusts her. Likes what she did with the IMF.
No, I'll tell you what he likes. Nordic beav.
Irresistible. Ooh!
What?
Oh, Minna!
Selina.
Hello.
Hello. I have not seen you since you failed to vote for me to be head of the IMF.
And, oh, you changed your hair.
Thank you, yes. I have more highlights.
And you changed your eyelids. You had oculoplasty.
Um...
You look more alert.
Yeah... (STAMMERS)
Well, the latest poll numbers are in and you've fallen 20 points behind the Widow Sherman.
We have to keep you away from people.
Yeah, surround you with some trees. Make you look human-sized.
Yeah, back to the natural habitat your nitwit mother found you in, you f*cking shaved Sasquatch.
But the good news is that you're only three points behind Jon H Ryan, whoever that is.
Hey, Slick. What's Blondie's situation?
Does she choke for Coke?
You should ask her.
Yeah.
It's been a very hard year.
The menopause has really taken a hold of me.
Is that so? Yeah.
Yes. You know... you're menopausal.
What?
You're menopausal as well.
No, I'm not.
Well...
No?
What?
No, you are.
No, you're older than me, so I...
No, I am actually two years younger.
Oh, I still have regular periods, but my joints, they're very swollen.
You know, I wonder if we can just get back to the Chinese.
The Chinese may try to change the terms of the done deal.
Really?
Yes.
But if they do this...
Yeah?
...you are simply ready to perform the walkout to convince the Chinese that you will not negotiate if the terms of the deal are not satisfactory.
Okay.
 and you take both your palms and you place them firmly on the table like that.
Oh, God.
Then you walk out.
And then someone must say this is unprecedented.
She never does this.
Ben can do that.
Who, me?
It is much harder than it sounds.
Perhaps we should rehearse?
Absolutely.
So this is unacceptable.
And then, uh, I walk out.
No, that is not credible. You try again.
This is unacceptable.
Mm-hmm.
No, you see, that's the same, but it's just louder.
She never does this.
Oh, no, that is good. Now, that is convincing.
: 
:
I want you to open your gift.
Since technically it's early Christmas Eve, I got you something.
What have we got here?
Oh.
It was used in 1907 at the Second Hague Convention.
And I figured you could use it to sign important peace treaties when you're officially elected.
It's actually lovely, Catherine.
Amex gave me this crazy new card that's made out of black metal.
It truly shows the special mommy-daughter bond that you and I share.
(KISSES)
So good.
I have an idea.
Marjorie, why don't you open my gift?
Oh, you got Marjorie a gift.
Marjorie's part of the family now, aren't you, pal?
Yeah, I got Marjorie a gift, too. Um, right, Gary?
Yeah.
It's beautiful.
Stuck in security.
Stuck in security. I don't know how that happened.
I got the tracking number.
Okay. Let's see what you got.
(LAUGHS)
Ah, it's an old book.
Do you like it?
I am overcome with emotion.
Oh, my God.
It's a first edition Gertrude Stein.
How did you know that, Dad?
I listen.
: I'm going to put this someplace special.
Hey.
Hi.
I noticed two golf carts filled with Asian people.
Yeah, we should go.
That's the kitchen crew and the chef.
They wear really nice suits.
Yeah.
Okay, I want to go find Marjorie's gift.
Me, too.
:
:
You're wearing that?
What?
Yeah. Oh.
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
This is President Lu Chi-Jang...
Secretary General of the Communist Party...
Studied chemical engineering.
He's currently on his second wife, he enjoys tennis.
...paramount leader of the People's Republic of China.
This is Zhang Shengxi.
He collects art.
Premier of the State Council.
His son is a freshman at Georgetown.
This is Xao Jintong, 1st Rank Vice Premier...
London School of Economics.
He enjoys fly fishing and his favorite snack is freeze-dried strawberries.
Thank you. I didn't get any of that except strawberries.
Okay.
...the exchanging of gifts.
This is a depiction of the most popular children's cartoon character in China, Sad Piglet.
It looks just like my daughter Catherine.
Huh?
:
 and this is a piglet.
Oh, no, no, no. I... I love it.
Believe me, if you say SeaWorld to Catherine you will understand what I'm talking about.
This is just lovely. Thank you very much.
And now our gift.
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
Oh.
This is a silk robe from the Qing Dynasty.
The dragon symbolizes good fortune.
Your generosity is overwhelming.
And so...
This is...
Seriously? This is beyond what we imagined.
Or prepared for.
This is a tapestry from Qing Dynasty.
The central image, the peony, is a symbol of royalty and virtue.
This is exquisite and I really hope that's all.
(LAUGHS)
And now our gifts for you.
(TRANSLATING)
This is an American geode, which symbolizes the solid foundation that we have between our two countries.
And it sparkles like we hope our conversation will sparkle.
Thank you for this rock.
Oh.
Um, and this wine from Napa Valley, California.
And this additional wine, also from a local vineyard in, uh, New Zealand, which is local to us and it's also close to Asia, which makes it local to you as we are all local friends.
Thank you.
She's just being polite.
President Lu does not drink.
Oh, God.
Um, Jang, there's a common saying here in America, "But wait, there's more."
So I would like to present our final gift to you.
(GROANS)
A very meaningful and historic pen from the Second Hague Conference of 1907.
Gary, the box.
What? Really?
Yes.
Oh!
This is a very worthy gift.
Oh, good.
It is historically significant and apt.
Gold is a very auspicious color for the Chinese.
It signifies prosperity and good luck.
Oh, great.
You have pleased them.
Oh, I'm pleased, then. Great.
And now they are discussing how casually you are dressed.
Hmm?
They say you look like a prisoner or a pirate.
An exercise book.
: 
 that the Chinese were going to out gift us like that?
Our intel suggested they hated you.
Ma'am, Dan and Amy for you.
What?
:
Oh, my God. What did he do this time?
No, he literally shot himself in the foot. We're in the ER.
: 
Turn on the...
These are the woods where I used to hunt with my stepfather.
And he taught me the proper...
(GUNSHOT)
(SCREAMING)
: Jesus!
Oh, my God.
:
(LAUGHING)
:
It's not funny, Ben.
I know, it's terrible.
A little bit of blood.
You are, it's all over the place.
Jonah shot himself in the eye with a rubber band in second grade.
 guns can be dangerous.
We're all praying for his recovery.
So lay it on me. How bad is it?
It's a complicated fracture. Shattered some bone.
They say it's gonna take...
No, not for him, for me.
Okay, I'm not listening to any more of this.
That's New Hampshire for O'Brien.
We got to have those factories now.
: Ni hao.
President Lu requests to go on a nature walk with you.
Well, I'm the president. I don't walk.
He is also the president and he likes to walk.
(GROANS) On a walk?
Camp David is where President Eisenhower came to recover after his heart attack.
(TRANSLATING)
Yeah. (GASPING)
Is he okay?
President Eis... he's pass... he's dead. He's long gone.
Uh, do you have more gum?
Can I bum a piece of gum?
Uh, may I chew gum with you?
Thank you. Chinese gum, huh?
Pretty cool. Never had it.
Oh, wow. It's got a kick.
Who knew?
Thank... oh, hang on.
I have just the thing.
Sorry, no, no. Wrong language.
Well, we need to work together to better engage with North Korea because the North Koreans are people like us.
Except without any food.
Hi, Mom. Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
No, no.
Just to be clear, my girlfriend and I aren't just vegan, we're raw vegan which means no meat, no dairy, and absolutely nothing cooked at all.
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
Thank you.
Okay, good.
Mom, come back soon, okay? Monica's making some nutmeg soy butter.
Oh, how wonderful. Thank you.
Ah, Jang, that was my daughter and she obviously did not recognize you.
She doesn't understand anything about global politics.
My family is here as a cover story.
No, but I didn't... I didn't do that.
I'm not... I didn't make that face.
Shall we carry on this way?
Can you translate "we need to get a new translator"? (LAUGHS)
: 
:
Catherine, can I borrow 200 Monopoly dollars?
Oh, everybody's still awake.
:
Hi.
Is that Marjorie's gift from security?
Yes.
Ma'am, I mean, you really didn't need to.
Oh.
(CATHERINE GASPS)
Ma'am, this is stunning.
Well, it's... it's vintage.
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh.
Feels like it was woven out of Catherine's silken hair. Feel this.
Aw.
I thought you might enjoy something...
:
...that was like her hair.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Oh, you're welcome. Ow.
: 
I got to go to bed.
:
Good night.
Good night.
You know that's government property, right?
You just committed a federal crime.
:
You got to see this.
Jesus, those are your pajamas?
It's the outfit I picture when I'm trying not to come.
Who's that?
Oh...
: 
What is this?
You need to be more careful. Guns can be dangerous.
: 
What the f*ck is going on?
Look, it's everywhere.
: 
Oh, my God. Hey.
It's the NRA.
It's a Christmas miracle.
(EXHALES)
All right, well, I'm gonna get back to this, so I'll see you later.
Okay, Kent, best guess, is New Hampshire back in play?
Ma'am, I don't even use the colloquial phrase "I guess."
Get Dan and Amy right now.
The Chinese are ready.
She never knocks.
Uh, Minna, I am right in the middle of something.
Selina, do I need to remind you how sensitive the Chinese are to promptness?
Then why is my wonton soup so cold every time they deliver it?
What?
Minna, I'm the middle of an international emergency.
Um, it's in the Middle East.
Shh.
It is in Kuwait and that's all I can say.
Kuwait?
That is so strange.
Because Amir Al-Khabat and myself, we follow each other on Instagram.
Only five minutes ago, he posted a picture of his dinner salad.
Ah, well, it happened right after he had that salad, in fact.
Sort of an intermezzo emergency.
Oop, I got Dan.
Al-Egan.
Yeah, the ambassador to Kuwait's liaison.
Thank you. As-salaam-alaikum, Dan.
Okay, I will take them for a walk.
:
Yeah. Okay.
Uh-huh.
:
Okay, so now we love the NRA.
Huh?
(ALL TALKING AT ONCE)
: 
They have changed the terms of the deal.
What?
The Chinese request the United States drop its objections to China's claim of the Diaoyu Islands.
How do I put this delicately?
The Chinese were very disturbed by a recent incident.
What? What incident?
With your daughter.
Oh, my God. Minna, seriously, that was a complete honest mistake.
Catherine was just confused.
But you are her mother. You did not stop her.
How could I have stopped her? I had to let her finish.
You're a mother. You've got a son.
I'm sure you've done it before.
You've been in this position.
No, I have not.
This happens occasionally in Iceland, but there it's just an accident.
What?
What?
God, this was their real demand from the beginning.
I mean, those islands didn't come out of nowhere.
Actually, they did. The Chinese created islands by piling sediment from under the sea...
Madam President, you can't give them these islands.
It'll destabilize the whole region.
Will you please go and talk to Chi-Jang and try...
I will try, but I don't know how much I'm going to be able to get his ear.
But what you're gonna need to do is let him get a word in.
Okay, well, you know what? This reminds me of negotiations between India and Bhutan.
Okay, this is what I'm talking about.
Bhutan was being stubborn.
So, I've got to go check on my other prom date.
Okay? I just...
Yes?
I'm sorry, do you know where I can get any more of this amazing Chinese gum?
It's nicotine gum.
Oh, no.
: 
 that our friends in Japan still have claims to the Diaoyu Islands.
President Lu says dropping your objections 
Well, that is unacceptable.
Unacceptable! (POUNDS TABLE)
She never does this.
I mean, I will storm out. Here I go.
No way. It's unacceptable!
This is not happening.
In all honesty, she's never done this.
I know two million sounds like a lot, sweetie.
It's not. It's a small price to pay to save the Brazilian rain forest.
But aren't you cutting down the rain forest in order to build the resort?
So we can conserve the rest.
It's a virtuous cycle.
Well, I guess that makes sense.
:
Hi, Mom.
What are you guys doing all the way out here?
We can talk about this later.
I'll leave the pamphlets on your pillow.
Thanks, Dad.
Darling. Lee.
Okay, listen to me.
If you want to get advice or talk about money, you can come to me, okay?
I've got the whole Treasury Department.
And they're, you know... they've been better, I realize.
I mean, Daddy loves you, sweetheart, but he's a crook.
I know.
Right?
Oh, excuse me.
I just thought I could...
I don't mean to interrupt an intimate moment, it's just that there have been seismic developments in the negotiations.
You have really rattled the Chinese leaders.
Oh.
Chinese leaders?
Yes, Catherine.
Seriously, Mom?
I think he is going to use the gold pen from the Second Hague Convention very soon.
Your mother has given an amazing pen to the Chinese leaders.
It's gold...
She knows... she knows about that pen.
You are so terrible.
Catherine.
No.
Catherine. Okay.
Sorry.
Even labor and delivery with her was a nightmare.
Oh, yes? Why is that?
You have a very narrow v*g1n*?
Well, tight. In the States we say tight.
The Chinese economy is in a worse state than anyone realized.
These sanctions, they are really crippling them.
And Chi-Jang, he is a proud, stubborn man.
Like a Chinese Mr. Darcy.
But stupid also, like a Chinese Mr. Bingley.
I love "Mary Poppins."
So if the United States lifts the sanctions and is prepared to meet their demands for industrial metals for the next 25 years, the Chinese might... might be prepared to discuss Tibet.
To bet on what?
Wait, to talk about freeing Tibet?
 aimed at a possible path to self-determination.
I'm freeing Tibet?
No, no, not free.
It would likely be one country, two systems similar to Hong Kong.
That's it.
Bono's gonna sh1t his sunglasses.
That is like some man on the moon legacy sh1t.
My God, Selina Meyer, the woman who freed Tibet.
Not... no, really, not free.
What about the factories in Ohio?
Jonah's ahead in all the latest polls.
f*ck those factories, man. I'm freeing Tibet.
f*ck it!
Really, not freeing.
It is, of course, tragic for the unemployed workers of Ohio and North Carolina.
Well, they should have tried going to college.
Worry about your own unemployment in Finland.
We don't have unemployment in Finland.
I'm gonna win a Nobel f*cking Peace Prize, you guys.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh, sorry. Are you all right?
It's okay.
And Tibet will have a new future.
(PHONE CHIMING)
Oh, God, sorry, sorry. Excuse me. Hey, babe.
Hare Krishna.
Hi. How was the ultrasound?
âª Meyer, Meyer, Selina Meyer... âª
Twins? Oh, my God.
Oh, no, I'm twice as happy now.
: 
Pow, pow.
(LAUGHS) Who should I vote for? You can't teach that.
I hope he votes for himself.
Oh, I'm sorry. I need another ballot.
I just... I just need another ballot.
Pow, pow.
: 
(KNOCKS) I want to tell you something, but it's very confidential, okay?
Mommy is going to free Tibet.
Catherine, come on, honey, remember when you were little and you had that "Free Tibet" sticker and you put it up on the wall and we couldn't get it off, remember, because you put it on wallpaper inexplicably.
Hey, Kit-Cat. It's me. Can I come in?
Hey, baby.
Well, yeah.
(CHUCKLES)
Wonderful.
Gan bei!
And now, let us celebrate with a traditional Christmas feast.
This is a... culturally significant and traditional...
Freedom log.
...freedom log.
Why don't we slice that up for everyone to enjoy?
You know, we have a statement that is ready for release.
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
There will be no statement.
These are very delicate issues and cannot be rushed.
Oh, yes, of course.
I understand that completely.
Although, perhaps when things are as significant as Tibet, things are accidently leaked to the press so that the world may know of our accomplishments.
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)
It would be very unfortunate if it also leaked that you lied to your country about our hacking of your tweets.
That is ridiculous.
We have your emails to prove it.
Okay, well, we can just wait for you guys to release a statement.
XiÃ¨ xie.
Minna.
Mr. McLintock?
Mm-hmm.
Good news.
Your adoption paper has been approved.
You and your wife soon will have a Chinese baby.
Congratulations.
What is happening?
: 
Catherine has any questions about the Brazil investment, always available.
I have a question.
Is it actually an investment in Brazil?
I can take this if you'd like.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, sure.
Thank you for everything, ma'am.
Oh, you're so welcome.
All right, wheels up in 10 minutes on Marine One.
Pick up the...
Oh, hi, Catherine.
Really?
What?
It's official.
At 8:20 this evening, the Widow Sherman conceded.
Oh, H.R. Fucknstuf, Jonah won the election?
It was a small margin.
But still counts as a sign of the apocalypse.
So Jonah's gonna vote for me and I'm...
: Gonna be president!
I've got to call him.
I got him. He's right here.
Oh, my God.
Congressman Ryan.
: 
Or should I call you colleague now?
I wouldn't.
And I just want to let you know that I, Congressman Jonah Ryan, will personally deliver you the vote that delivers you the presidency.
That means so much to me.
New Hampshire is struggling with an epidemic of opiate addict...
Yeah, I'm not gonna...
Oh! Oh, God.
Oh, good. That goes in my bag.
Yeah.
(CHEERING)
I can elect anyone in New Hampshire.
I can elect a Muslim AIDS virus.
Okay, Jeff.
A terrorist f*cking AIDS virus in the tiniest suicide vest ever made, I could make it governor of New Hampshire.
Okay, Jeff, you're drunk.
New Hampshire, wow. Wow, New Hampshire.
Thank you.
Oh, my God. I did this.
We just elected Jonah to Congress.
Looking around, I see so many familiar faces of people that supported me and believed in me.
: Yeah.
And I see a few that didn't.
(LAUGHTER)
Like Jessica Thompson.
Hey, Jessica. Jessica, I see you there.
Yeah, it's been a long time since high school.
I like what you did with your hair.
Do you like what I did with my life?
: Oh!
Jimmy O'Connor, I've been waiting 20 years to say this to you.
Oh, my God, I did this.
You just elected Jonah to Congress.
: 
But through it all, there was one person who truly believed in Jonah Ryan and that was Jonah Ryan.
This is my dream, that you can believe in yourself so hard that you eventually become a congressman.
Thank you, New Hampshire. Thank you.
: 
Jonah is gonna be sworn in with the rest of the freshmen.
Yeah.
Mom, I've come to a decision, by the way, about the Palm Beach house.
Okay, Catherine, listen...
I'm keeping it.
Oh, Catherine.
And I'm turning it into a sanctuary for rescued farm animals.
What?
Rescued farm animals.
Yeah, I heard her.
I think it's inspiring, ma'am.
You're taking my daddy's house and turning it into some Club Med for goats?
Well, it won't be just goats.
I mean, there's so much property that we were talking about all different kinds of animals.
I mean, you could have ducks or...
:
Pigs.
:
Emus.
Oh.
And we could have horses as well.
Okay.
:
Can you do llamas?
Oh, yeah, we could have llamas.
:
Maybe a three-legged goat.
