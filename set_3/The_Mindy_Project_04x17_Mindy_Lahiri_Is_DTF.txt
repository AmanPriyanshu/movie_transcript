I haven't had s*x in such a long time, I'm thinking about donating my thongs to the troops.

Well, we all go through dry spells.
I once went ten days without having s*x.
I was in a medically induced coma after a sailboat accident.
Ten days?

This is the longest I've gone without having s*x since the first 25 years of my life.
