What happened?
Rita told Weilan to make herself at home.
We live here, too.
I don't think Weilan realizes that.
That girl needs a serious talking to.
As much as I'd love to stay and help...
I have to go to work.
Morning.
Hi. So how did you sleep?
Ah, great. It's so quiet down here.
Not like Shanghai.
Oh, what's Shanghai like?
It's big and modern. It's a city of the future.
I would love to go there.
Wouldn't you, Ondina?
I thought you were going to work.
You work?
At the Marine Park.
I still can't understand why you have that job.
If you want to see dolphins, take a swim in the sea.
You should come.
Ondina will tell you how to get there. Right, Ondina?
Bye.
Bye.
I love this place. 
It's so much bigger than my apartment back home.
Yeah, we loved it, too... when it was clean.
Morning.
Weilan, everything okay?
Mmm-hmm. Great, thanks, Rita.
: Okay. Well, I have to fly, so I'll see you after.
Bye.
Rita!
How long will she be staying in our grotto?
 Uh, Weilan will be here for as long as she's here.
And please remember it's my grotto, not yours.
Sorry.
 Look, Weilan has been through some really tough times.
I was hoping you and Mimmi would make her feel welcome.
She endangered our pod.
I don't have time to talk about this now.
Just keep an eye on her.
Make sure she doesn't get into trouble.
What?
Please?
Weilan?
This isn't something I expected to see.
What?
A merman sitting in a café with a juice.
I thought you'd be out riding a whale, or summoning up a storm.
Well, you ride one whale, you've, uh... ridden them all.
Bro, bro, bro? Can you believe it?
I just called the police about the sea monster, and they laughed at me.
What did you tell them exactly?
Well, what do you think?
I told them that a monster came up out of the water and attacked our boat.
But they didn't believe you?
No.
That's why I need you to call them and back up our story.
Oh, and make sure you sound as scared as you did last night.
Hey, you were just as scared as I was.
Me? Nah. 
Just a little excited, that's all.
So, you gonna help me, or what?
Maybe we didn't see a sea monster.
Are you... are you kidding? You were standing right next to me.
I don't really know what we saw.
 You know what? Fine.
Okay? But don't come running to me for a loan when I'm rich, because I reckon there's a buck in this.
I'll try the Marine Park.
Maybe they'll listen.
How come you're not hanging with the tail gang?
Ondina and I didn't exactly hit it off.
Ondina can be prickly.
Giant sea urchin prickly.
: Zac?
David, this is Weilan. The girl we told you about.
Sorry about throwing you around the jetty.
Never mind that. Joe's obsessed with the sea monster.
He's going to the authorities about it.
: Relax.
No one is going to believe him.
If you say so.
There you go. And you can play with those in the bath.
Thank you.
Just make sure you don't touch it on the forehead.
Real dolphins don't like that.
Chris!
When did you get back?
Yesterday.
Sorry. Mimmi, this is Karl. Karl's new here.
He trained in San Diego as well, but his specialty is sharks.
So you're the famous Mimmi. I've heard a lot about you.
All of it good, I promise.
Hey, uh, notice anything?
You're a dolphin trainer. I knew you could do it.
Without you I wouldn't have been able to get into the training course.
Well, I was just happy to help.
We better get going. Don't want to be late on our first day.
I'll catch up.
It's good to see you.
You've got to tell me about San Diego sometime.
I want to hear all about it.
: Chris, are you coming?
Thank you.
: Hi, Weilan.
Just browsing, or are you after something special?
Seeing as I'm going to be here for a while, I thought I should start dressing like the natives.
You have some really nice stuff.
I try and keep the natives happy.
Mind if I try this on?
Sure. The change room's in there.
Hi, Ondina.
 Have you seen our houseguest?
: You mean Weilan?
: Rita asked me to keep an eye on her, but she ran out on me.
 I have no idea what goes on in that girl's brain, assuming she has one.
Uh, Ondina--
You should see what she's done to the grotto.
I can't wait till she's gone.
Um--
If she comes in, just tell her I'm looking for her.
For your information... I do have a brain.
Oh, great.
Look, I know you're not happy about me being here.
You got that right.
We got off to a bad start, but that doesn't mean we have to be enemies.
You should give me a chance. We could have fun together.
I'm not interested in fun.
See, right there is your problem.
I'm more concerned with protecting the pod.
Something a real mermaid would understand.
Hey!
I am a real mermaid.
A real mermaid would never endanger other mermaids.
Meaning?
Meaning that I couldn't help but notice that your arrival coincided with the dragon's.
You think I brought it?
Didn't you?
Well, this has been fun.
Now I'm off to teach a class of real mermaids.
: Chris?
There's probably nothing to this, but I want you and Karl to go out to Mako and do some diving.
Just... take a look around for me.
No problem. What are we looking for?
You don't think Joe really saw a sea monster?
Of course he didn't, but he obviously saw something.
You know, scientists believe that the Loch Ness Monster is a plesiosaur living inside caves in the loch.
I'm just saying, there's caves under Mako.
I'm pretty sure there's nothing there.
Yeah, but you can't be certain, can you?
Sharks are most often active at night, which is when it's best to feed.
Surprisingly, they're a bit hard to see in the dark.
So we use this heat-sensing equipment to observe them.
If you were a shark... this is what you'd look like.
: Wow!
: Whoa!
Sorry, guys. That's it for today.
Thanks for coming.
That was awesome.
That was great.
How would you feel about getting out into the real ocean?
Sure. What's up?
We're going on a monster hunt.
Wow!
Oh!
: Wow!
Oh, my goodness.
This is amazing.
The moon pool is the magical heart of Mako... so I suppose it's appropriate that you should have your lessons in here.
Thanks, Ondina. This is awesome.
Well, according to that guy's coordinates, this is where he saw it.
I still think this is pointless.
Karl, global warming is affecting ocean temperatures.
You know, water currents are changing.
This could bring up all kinds of stuff from the deep.
 Yeah, yeah. Dream on.
: Glad you came! Ondina told you how to get here?
: It was Zac.
Ondina and I aren't exactly getting on.
Ondina takes some time to warm to people.
But don't worry.
In a couple of days it'll be like you're old friends.
More like a couple of centuries.
Ondina takes some getting used to, but she has a good heart.
You could've fooled me.
I was trying to be friendly, but she blew me off.
Said I wasn't a real mermaid.
Let's go get a drink.
: So once we knew there was no way of stopping the dragon, the pod fled to the only safe place... land.
Did you ever look for them?
China is a big country and... my grandmother's old.
So we stayed in Shanghai and...
I pretty much became a land girl.
I can't imagine how hard it must have been for you, losing your pod.
It was... 
 awful.
And that's why, despite what Ondina thinks, I would never do anything to hurt your pod.
I'll have a word with her and try and get her to lighten up.
So I should try talking to her in... oh, about a year?
Well, I have to get back to work.
Thanks for listening.
Sure.
What are you up to now?
Well, Evie has a couple of really nice dresses I want to try on.
Hmm.
Remember, we're gonna have to stay in sight of each other.
Unlikely as it seems, what if we find something?
Get pictures and we get out of there.
Works for me.
Each of you is special. Do you know why?
You're special because you're part of the pod.
Your powers are strongest when you work together.
We already did water balls.
Yes, I know.
Now catch!
Good. Now pass it on.
You're in a good mood.
I just spoke to the guy in charge of the Marine Park.
He sent two of his best guys to check it out.
When are they going?
They're out there right now.
Yeah, with some sort of heat-sensing equipment.
So if that thing is down there, they're gonna find it.
 Weilan!
Hey, David. What's up?
The sea monster we saw...
The water dragon?
Do you think it's still hanging around Mako?
Mmm-mmm.
The dragon only forms under the full moon, so it's safe for the moment.
Why do you ask?
Well, that was a total bust.
We can't give up yet.
I don't see any sea monster. Do you?
Maybe it doesn't want to be found.
Where would it go?
Well, there's caves under Mako.
Fine.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
: Mimmi!
: Any luck with the dresses?
Some people from the Marine Park are going to Mako to look for the dragon.
I know, but we don't have to worry.
You said the dragon won't appear until the next full moon.
But Ondina's out there teaching.
Mermaids can cloak.
They've got some sort of gear that can sense heat.
Mermaids might be able to cloak, but their bodies are still warm.
: The caves of Mako are uncharted, so be careful.
Might take the heat sensor, see if I can pick anything up.
Mind if I borrow it?
Go for it.
But if anything happens to it, you're paying.
Good work.
Don't worry. It just takes practice.
Have another go.
You've done very well today. You should all be proud of yourselves.
Off you go.
: Thank you, Ondina.
See ya!
Bye!
Bye. Thank you.
This is where Ondina teaches.
Is there anywhere else she might be?
Are you okay?
No.
There was a land boy in the moon pool.
Did he see you?
I cloaked, but... he kept looking at me as if he knew I was there.
Something was in that cave.
Did you get a picture?
No, it was...
It was invisible.
You saw something invisible in the cave.
I felt something brush past me when I swam out.
Did you see something?
You mean the invisible thing? Yeah, yeah, I saw that.
I'm going back in for another look.
I'm too low on air to dive again, and you can't dive without me.
Sorry, buddy, but we're heading home.
: It looks like they're leaving.
It can't be soon enough for me.
They came looking for a dragon, remember?
: So?
So, what if they keep looking?
There's a chance they could find the pod.
Weilan's right. We can't risk them coming back.
So what do you suggest? Sink their boat?
I think we can be a bit more subtle than that.
I'm starving. Fancy a burger on the way home?
Yeah.
What is that?
Some kind of current?
I guess we've found the sea monster.
: I think we scared them off.
No, no, no, no. I know what I saw, all right?
That was the Marine Park. They think I saw a waterspout.
Unbelievable!
Well, maybe they're right.
I saw a sea monster, and so did you!
Waterspouts are common in subtropical areas, especially at this time of year.
We did see something.
Didn't we?
Mmm... diesel fumes can make your head spin, and they certainly made me nauseous.
A waterspout?
 Did you clean up?
It was like this when I arrived.
Weilan must have done it.
You should be nice to her. She's had it tough.
And we haven't?
Well, you said she was selfish.
She didn't have to help us today, but she did.
That doesn't sound selfish to me.
How did you go with Chris?
It's all good.
He won't be going back to Mako.
Score one for the mermaids.
The grotto looks nice.
Rita explained that you live here, too.
Sorry about the mess. 
Anyone hungry?
I got this fresh from the café.
Mmm! Looks good.
Try some, Ondina.
The waterspout?
That was clever.
"Clever"?
You heard.
Was that a thank you?
Pretty big one, actually.
Mmm... lobster tail!
Hey! That's the best bit.
I know.
Well, I hope you're gonna share.
 Make me.
