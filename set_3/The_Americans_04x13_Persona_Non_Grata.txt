It's... dangerous what you and dad do?
Sometimes.
Henry's really close to Mr. Beeman, and we have no idea what he's saying to him about us.
You always say we'll get through this, but you never say how.
: You wanna be Matthew's friend? Be Matthew's friend, but don't do
 because of us.
: I just saw Burov.
He gave me enough pieces to put something together.
Probably an agent in place working on biological weapons.
Just got something new in from Fort Detrick.
A modified strain of the Lassa virus... causes a hemorrhagic fever that liquefies your organs.
Louisville field office found a William Crandall.
Foster Medical, right?
Got him.
I know you've lost your sense of why we do this, but I promise you, it matters.

Mr. Crandall.
I'm Agent Beeman.
This is Agent Aderholt.
We're with the FBI.
[monitors continue beeping]
At a time like this, we can all just be human beings.
If there's anything we can do to make you more comfortable...
Comfortable. [Chuckles]
[weakly] There is nothing you or a-anyone can do to make me comfortable.
In a few days, everything that's inside me that... matters... will have oozed out through my orifices.

I'm a dead man.
It's a very unusual feeling.

Hi, Hon.

Alice had her baby.
Oh. Boy or girl?
Girl. Claire Louise.
Oh.
Pastor Tim left a message. I haven't called back yet.
I didn't know what to say.
Well, I guess we should, um, all go visit them.
All three of us?
Henry, too.
Is it too soon?
[Sighs]
How soon until you wanted visitors when you had me?
I didn't have many friends, so...
[sighs]
Maybe I should go first after church tomorrow just to say hi.
Yeah, call first.
Yeah.
And then we can all go see them later when they're home.
That makes sense.
I have a gift you can take.
Good.
Where's Dad? Working?
No, um, he's... at this... it's sort of like a class.
He's at a class?
It's called EST.
Uh, it's like a seminar in... thinking about yourself.
Remember, he went with Stan one time?
Right. Okay.
[sighs] Did you eat?
No.
I'll make something.
: [Amplified voice] Travel agent is pretty much the only job I've ever known.
Uh, it... it suited me.
I-I like to travel, see new places and... meet new people.
But, I mean, you choose a job before you really know if you'll like it, right?
I mean, when you're young, you don't... know anything... who you are, what you wanna do, be.
You pick something because it fits what you like, what... what you need.
But life changes things, you change, or... or something.
And then one day you wake up, and you don't want to go into the office.
You don't wanna make arrangements for people you don't know and don't give a sh1t about.
You...
You don't wanna do it.
You just don't.
Every morning, I wake up with this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.
Okay.
So... why don't you quit, find a new job?
I can't.
Why not?
Because I have commitments. I've made promises.
To who?
To... people who trust me and people I love.
And you don't wanna let them down?
No.
But it's okay to let yourself down?
Do you think your family would no longer love you if you quit?
Do you think the world would stop spinning?
'Cause I got news for you.
You ain't that important.
It was two different intercepts, and he doesn't show up at your meeting or your alternate.
I've called him three times. They've got him.
The question now is William.
It's not like he was so happy to do this in the first place.
No.
I'm not saying he walked it over to them.
But now that they have him, they probably have something enticing to offer.
You spent more time with him than I did.
I hadn't thought about him like that.
I mean, he bitched and moaned and was... an asshole.
I guess it's possible.
He's been here. We better go.

[exhales deeply]
To what do I owe this pleasure?
We recently arrested a man named William Crandall.
He was a scientist working at a lab called Foster Medical Research, but in fact, he was a member of Directorate S spying for your government, stealing secrets to be used in your nation's biological weapons program.
That's... very surprising.
To my knowledge, my country doesn't have a biological weapons program.
In fact, it is my understanding, according to the treaties, yours doesn't have one either.
So it would be shocking to discover that you're working on such a...
We only work on research to create antidotes and medicines for the weapons we know you're making.
You should really make these baseless accusations to the Ambassador.
I'm just Cultural Attaché, as you know.
We know exactly who you are, and we will be speaking to the Ambassador directly, as well as to the Foreign Minister in Moscow.
President Reagan expects your country to keep to the treaties it signed.
And he will be bringing this incident up with Andropov shortly.
You've gone too far.
Bugging my predecessor's office, having one of your officers marry his secretary, which is the lowest thing I have seen in my entire life.
And now this... you're being expelled from the country.
You have no proof.
You killed Frank Gaad.
Agent Wolfe...
I don't care.
I wanna see his face.
You've got 48 hours to get out.
[monitor beeping steadily]
: Are you in pain?
The strain I gave myself gets to the hemorrhagic fever stage pretty quickly.
Anyone you'd like us to contact, Mr. Crandall?
[breathing unevenly] Agent Aderholt...
: We have channels we can use.
No doubt.
After so many years in your country as your unwelcomed guest, there is no one.
Besides, anyone who needs to know, knows.
They don't know if you've told us anything.
No. They don't know that.
Did you like it... what you did?
It was exciting at first.
[gasps] Like all new things.
Auspicious beginnings and all that.
I was committed to something.
[breathing unevenly]
And I was... invisible.
To us?
[Grunts]
T-To everyone. [Chuckles]
[chuckles] Made me feel special, like I was the star in my very own movie.
Then... over time, the thing that made it special, made me special, my secret power, as it were... [breathing unevenly] became a curse.
I was alone, isolated.
Lonely. Very lonely.
I'd reach out to people. [breathing unevenly]
Not friends, exactly.
Maybe acquaintances, more like.
But there was always... a distance.
A...a barrier.
The absence of closeness makes you... dry inside.
But still committed.
It was the only thing I had left.
[monitors continue beeping]
Anything new?
No.
But the longer they have William in custody, the greater the risk to you.
It's been a hard year.
Yeah.
The problems pile up.
It's hard to know when it's too late.
If William talks to the FBI, risks on top of risks, when do we stop?
I think you two and your children should return home.
What?
Philip, your heart hasn't been in this for a long time.
Elizabeth, you've been doing this for almost 20 years.
The job wasn't meant to be forever.
So what, the Centre wants us to pack our bags and come home?
You've had a good, long tour.
The Centre would welcome you with honors the moment you tell them you're ready.
But with William under arrest, you're in immediate danger.
I know.
I know you've always been in danger, but that can dull the senses.
I think it's time.
I want you to go home and get your kids.
And get yourselves to a safe house.
But, of course, it's your decision.

What?
He cheated on my mom. Did you know that?

 mom."

Yeah.

Really?
Yeah. He was working late a lot, and it happened to my friend with her dad and his secretary.
I asked my mom about it.
Really?
Yeah.
What'd she say?
She said no. She trusted him.
But I don't know how you know.

.. sacking him six times and forced three turnovers.
The cornerbacks for the Raiders, Lester Hayes and Mike Haynes, frustrated the Redskins wide receivers all game long with their physical bump and run coverage.
: I guess a lot of people is gonna think like that, but if you can really view the film, you know, any football expert, you would see that, you know, I was open the entire game.
