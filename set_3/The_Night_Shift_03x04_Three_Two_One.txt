: No justice, no peace!
We're in front of the courthouse as crowds await the verdict on Steven Benedict, the 45-year-old white male on trial for shooting an African-American man six months ago.
This man is no "highway hero"!
He is a "roadside racist"!
[Yelling]
We want justice, and we want it now!
No justice, no peace!
: No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!
Everybody, this is Dr. T.C. Callahan.
Doc is an ex-Ranger and combat vet, so he's not gonna wet his pants if things get a little hairy out there.
I brought my diapers, so no promises.
In all seriousness, post-San Bernardino, we've been recruiting ER docs so that we've got medical personnel with us on-scene.
Nice to have you, Doc.
Let's just keep everybody safe.
Yes, sir.
That's five minutes from here.
Heading out right away.
We got an officer-related shooting nearby.
: Gear up!
That didn't take long.
Never does. Let's move!
[Whistles] Nice bling, Paris Hilton.
A gift from my dad... you know, for switching to surgery.
Ooh!
Well, when I started my residency, my mom bought me a used iron.
[Chuckles]
: 
Oh, is this the verdict?
Shh, shh.
: 
: Can you believe that?
Kenny, thanks for joining us. Almost forgot you worked here.
Please get ready.
[Cellphone rings]
Sorry. Sorry.
Hello?
Yeah.
Topher's pissed?
Yeah.
I mean, you know he wanted all hands on deck when the verdict came down.
Yeah, well, tell that to the cop that stopped to question me for 30 minutes.
Why'd he stop you?
Speeding. 30 in a 25. Bunch of BS.
I mean, technically, that 
 speeding.
More like DWB.
How is that driving while black?
You just admitted to speeding.
I was going 30 in a 25... no faster than anybody else, but I'm the one that got ticketed.
All right. I'm just saying I've never been stopped.
Well, maybe that's because you driving that Beemer Daddy got you.
Got a... got a cardigan tied around your neck and a tennis-club bumper sticker on the back.
Yes. Yes, sir. W-We'll take care of it. Thank you.
[Beep]
Kenny, come back here.
All right, people, I have the D.A., the Chief of Police, and the Governor up my ass about this.
Steven Benedict 
 coming to us. He's just a few minutes away.
Jordan, he's yours. Get him medically cleared ASAP.
Kenny, you help.
I-I still got to change, man. Can I just...
Kenny, we're short-staffed.
I need my best people getting him worked up and back to jail.
Please, get on it!
Fine. Thank you, Dr. Zia. Yes.
What the...
I think he's having a bad day.
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.
I don't want this guy coming here. It's distracting.
Everybody has an opinion about the case.
I don't want it interfering with the work.
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
I-I got to talk to security.
Word gets out he's coming here, this place is gonna be a madhouse.
So, we're getting the... the "highway hero"?
Hero? Please.
He murdered the guy in cold blood.
No, no, no. He shot a guy who was gonna kill him.
And when you get attacked, you can either run or you can fight, and he couldn't run.
We don't know that.
All right. You know what?
Let's keep the politics out of the ER tonight.
All right? It's gonna be busy.
Hey.
Hmm?
Is Rick on duty tonight?
Uh, no. He's training the Houston SWAT all week.
T.C.'s out there, though.
Of course.
He was one of the first doctors to sign up for San Antonio SWAT.
Only because I was in Afghanistan.
[Chuckles] Okay, you know what?
You can put the measuring tape away.
We all know you got a big one, too.
Feel free to say that louder.
[Chuckles]
[Siren wails]
Steven Benedict... 45, healthy.
Status post an atraumatic syncopal episode in court.
Denies chest pains or focal weakness.
Vitals?
Stable. A and O times three.
Slightly decreased blood sugar on-scene to 55.
All right, let's get him to Trauma 1.
How are you feeling, Mr. Benedict?
I don't... I don't know why I fainted.
 do... about to be found guilty.
Kenny!
...about Mr. Benedict's medical condition?
Whoa, whoa. Check with the Sheriff's Department.
We're just here to treat him.
One statement. Anything.
Okay. Here's a statement.
Anybody steps through the door, we're calling the cops.
[Indistinct shouting]
[Gasps]
: Move it! Make a hole!
Doctor coming in!
Hey! Hey! Let's go!
Let's go, Doc! You got to help my partner!
On it. On it.
What happened?
Well, we got separated investigating a call about somebody with a gun.
Next thing you know, I heard shots, and David was returning fire when I got there.
He was down, and I unloaded two rounds into the vic.
Damn it. Missed his vest. Sounds like a collapsed lung.
Well, then fix it!
I'm on it, okay? There's one of me, two of them.
Let me do my job and triage.
Hey, is this absolutely necessary?
He's under arrest! He shot a cop!
Well, he's gonna die if I can't treat him properly.
Hey, look, there's five of you, okay?
Just look after him. Uncuff him. Now!
GSWs, right upper quadrant.
Okay, buddy.
Just need you to hold that right there, okay?
All right.
You got it?
[Voice breaking] Am I gonna die?
No, no, no. 'Course not. We're not gonna let that happen.
It's okay.
Okay. They're both critical.
We need to load them up in an ambulance, get them to the hospital right away.
That ship has sailed, Doc.
Things are escalating fast. Word's out on the shooting.
Hey, he pulled on 
 It isn't one of those!
Look, I'm just telling you the situation.
We're not getting out of here in a vehicle right now.
There's already rioters blocking the roads.
Okay, we'll bring in the chopper, all right?
We got to transport now.
It's not available yet.
It's responding to a call outside the city.
It's gonna be about 20 minutes.
No, that's too long. I don't have 20 minutes.
I can't look after two criticals on my own.
Okay. You can't get us out of here.
Can you get doctors here?
I can probably make it work.
Okay, I need you to call San Antonio Memorial and tell them we need Dr. Scott Clemmens ASAP.
Got it.
Hang in there, buddy. We got you. We got you.
Okay.
[Air whooshing]
Thank you.
Yo, man, not cool calling me out in front of everyone about my car.
Calling you out?
Look, I was getting my ass chewed out for being late because I got pulled over.
[Chuckling] And you're all, like, "Well, technically, you were speeding."
I made an observation, all right?
Yeah, I made one, too, man. You living in a bubble.
Hey, man. I-I lived in Philly for eight years. I'm not blind.
I just don't think everybody's out trying to get me because of my color.
Hey, I don't think everybody's out trying to get me, either.
Okay? So don't go all Trump on me.
But going to Ivy League Penn, staying in that condo Daddy got you, ain't "living in Philly," bro.
[Elevator bell dings]
Hey. Paul. Let's go. You're coming with me.
Keep him NPO?
Okay.
T.C.'s got two GSWs.
One of them's a cop, the other one's a kid.
They're both critical, and he can't get in.
The streets are all blocked with protestors.
We... We're going out there?
Yeah. Let's go.
[Monitors beeping]
: Okay, so, you say you've never fainted before?
No, never.
But I'm not faking it. I swear.
I really don't feel very well.
I believe you, but if you keep talking, I can't listen to your heart.
I don't hate black people.
Interesting way to start a conversation.
Well, because I see the way you look at me, and I need you to know that I'm not what they say I am.
And who is "they"?
The media.
This is all their fault.
Mm. 
 the ones that shot that black guy.
All this time, I thought that was you.
Kenny, please.
No, it's okay.
I want to talk about this.
So, you think that I'm just some racist who shot a man because he was black?
I was afraid for my life.
Hey, I guess that worked for George Zimmerman, so why not?
Oh, come on. You 
 compare the two.
I'm not some nutjob who's out looking for a fight.
You had a loaded weapon.
You saw someone who didn't fit in your neighborhood.
No, my car broke down.
I was waiting for a tow, and he kept banging at my window.
Eight shots into that man.
Eight shots.
He just kept coming!
Okay, you know what? Enough. Both of you.
You've had your debate. We are done.
Right now, let's focus on what's going on with Mr. Benedict, all right?
Kenny, please, will you take this blood to the lab and order an X-ray?
[Sighs]
[Door opens]
Don't be mad at him. I'm used to it.
Every black person in the city hates me now.
But I'm not faking it.
There is something wrong with me.
Okay.
We've seen it on the streets of New York.
We've seen it on the streets of St. Louis.
Now we're seeing it in San Antonio!
What are we gonna do?
The systems of inequality need to stop in this country!
[Yelling]
We are tired of this!
Hey, here they come! Look out! Look out!
Look at them! They don't even care about us!
[Yelling]
What are we gonna do, huh?
We're gonna stop them.
[Siren wails]
[Yelling, chanting, whistling]
: Move!
This is as far as the ambulance will go!
You got to get out now!
Back them up! Back them up!
Put these on.
Which way?
Four blocks this way.
We'll take you the rest of the way.
Move!
♪♪
[Yelling, chanting]
You guys okay?
Yeah. Paul?
I-I guess.
Hey, he's got a hot abdomen.
Probably lost three or four liters in there.
Let's get him down.
Yeah.
I'll run a central line to transfuse.
Here's the blood.
Okay.
Ready? Take it easy.
We're here to help, okay? I'm Paul.
I didn't do anything.
Why is this happening?
I don't know.
But I need you to hang in there, all right?
[Voice breaking] They just shot me.
I was working.
Why'd they shoot me?
Paul! I need cricoid!
His cords are way anterior!
Yeah. Okay.
Come on, buddy.
Don't leave me.
I'll be right back. I promise.
: It's okay. We're gonna get you to the hospital real soon.
David? David, you're gonna be okay.
I'm right here. I'm not leaving you.
There we go. There we go.
What's the update?
The chopper's close, but we're having trouble containing the rioting.
Wind's blowing tear gas everywhere.
Tear gas?
Just added fuel to the fire.
Itchy fingers. Some rookie in the line panicked.
Okay, got it.
Thanks, Paul.
: 
It's getting bad out there. They're using tear gas.
Better than bullets.
Mr. Sanchez?
Okay, Nurse, take Mr. Sanchez to Trauma 4 for suturing.
Nice work on that hematoma block.
Thanks. I've never reduced a boxer's fracture before.
Yeah, uh, Toph, broken hand in Curtain 2 is reduced, splinted, ready to go.
Thank goodness.
Patients are flooding in, and we're running out of beds.
And I'm thinking...
Son of a...
This place is gonna get swarmed.
Is Jordan still working on that guy?
Last I heard.
Oh, cool.
Look, she's doing the report right in our ambulance bay.
Yeah, no, not cool.
Hey, Security, let's get them out of here.
Guys!
You can't block this doorway! This is a hospital!
19-year-old male, coughing spasms and shortness of breath from tear gas exposure.
Stats are stable.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. [Coughing]
No, you can't bring him in here.
Sara, Sara, he has to be decontaminated outside, so go on... we'll meet you there.
Okay, but FYI, there's a bunch of these heading your way.
Okay. Drew...
Yeah, yeah. On it. On it.
Shannon, you ever set up a decontamination tent?
No, but I'm guessing I'm about to.
[Yelling, sirens wail]
Equal breath sounds.
Symmetrical chest rise.
: Okay, good. He's secure.
First unit's almost done.
BP's coming up.
See, Sean?
I told you... We're gonna help you out.
I don't want to die.
You won't, okay? It's almost over.
The chopper's landing around the corner.
We can only fit one at a time.
Okay, well, they both got to go 
David's going first. He's a cop.
That's not how we do things, okay?
We go based on who's in the worst condition.
That guy shot David! He's not going first!
He said he didn't do anything.
They all say that!
: All right, stop!
Paul, come here. Take over.
This is a medical decision.
The officer is stable now that he's been intubated, but this kid's got a belly full of blood.
Okay. Scott?
His pressure's up since the transfusion. He can wait.
If one of the bullets in this cop's chest hit his heart, he could code at any second.
He's gotta go first.
: The roads will be cleared in 10 minutes.
Get Officer Gallik in the chopper.
The kid can follow in the ambulance.
We got to make a decision here, Scott.
Your kid is still transfusing.
Which we could do in the chopper!
Paul, I've had to make the decision a hundred times in combat.
Have 
I know it sucks, okay?
But somebody's got to go first.
It's got to be the officer.
Let's saddle up!
Okay.
Hey.
If this kid bleeds out, it's on 
I know. I know.
Okay, you set? On three. One, two...
They shot 
 and 
 have to stay?
They said you shot at them first.
And you believe them?
I was just defending myself.
They shot at me.
I didn't know they were cops.
It's crazy out here.
I-I don't know.
I-I'm a doctor. I just want to fix you.
Sean.
Then you should have taken me first.
This is for your pain, and it's gonna help you sleep.
We're gonna have you out of here in 10, 15 minutes.
It's gonna be okay.
Yeah. [Breathing heavily] For 
[Both gasp]
[Cheering]
Move out! Move out!
We got to get him out of here now!
So, there's nothing wrong with him?
Well, not necessarily. I still have a few tests pending.
I appreciate you being thorough, but we have a waiting room full of patients.
Get his tests. Get him out of here.
Hey, look whose bloodwork showed that there's absolutely nothing wrong with him.
So now we have our answer.
There's nothing emergent about his condition.
He can be treated by a jail doc.
Sign him out.
I'm... not sure. I... [Sighs]
You're not sure?
No.
I think that there might actually be something wrong with him.
: Topher, he's faking it.
Look, the guy's buying time because he knows he's about to spend the rest of his life in prison with a bunch of those black people he says he doesn't hate.
Except this time, no gun.
Kenny.
Jordan, his tests are all normal.
He fainted right before he was gonna be sentenced.
I think it's pretty clear what's going on.
[Cellphone vibrates, beeps]
I'd probably fake something, too.
Yeah?
Okay. Hold on.
Listen up! T.C. is on his way with the downed officer!
A 
 more causalities are headed this way.
Get Benedict out of here. Start treating new patients.
Yeah, I need... I need an estimate.
All right. I'll go tell the Sheriff to take him back...
No, not yet.
But Topher just said that...
 patient, not his.
Why are you defending this guy?
I'm not defending him. I'm treating him.
Yeah, treating him like a V.I.P. You know what he did.
I know what he's 
 of.
So you think he's innocent?
I-I don't know.
I haven't followed the case that closely.
I understand that this is personal for you, but sometimes, as a medical professional, you have to...
Personal?
Look, people like that... that superior attitude, th-that eye that looks down at me without even knowing me... now, I've dealt with that my entire life.
I mean, do you know what it feels like to get on an elevator with a white lady all alone and to see her ever so subtly clench her purse just because you're standing there?
To have to almost apologize for being a big, strong black guy?
Turn on the... the smile and the charm just because... just because you can see the fear in her face, th-the suspicion in her eyes?
Now, is it my responsibility to go out of my way to make her feel at ease?
Or is it her job not to make assumptions about me?
You see, these are the things that I deal with on a daily basis.
Now, I know you're a good person.
Jordan, we're family. That's undeniable.
But please don't get pissed at me for not going above and beyond my job for this guy the way that you do.
I'm not pissed at you.
Okay, I just think that...
What?!
Forget it. Okay?
I just... I don't want to get into it.
What? No. I want to hear what you got to say.
Okay, uh... aren't you doing the same thing?
You know, making assumptions, calling him "Zimmerman"?
You weren't there. You don't know what happened.
Yeah, but the only other person that 
 is dead.
Yeah, but that guy... he's been arrested for assault multiple times.
How did Benedict know that?
Huh?
What did he do, pull up his police report right there on the spot before he decided to shoot him eight times?
Fair enough.
Look, all I am trying to say to you is that I understand his fear.
And not because the guy that he shot was black, all right?
You know that.
I'm saying I... I understand that vulnerability.
You know, when I had a stalker, I went out and I bought a gun.
Yeah, but you never used it, Jordan.
No, but... [Sighs] to be perfectly honest with you, if it were me stranded on the side of the road in the middle of the night in my broken-down car and some guy... I don't care if he's black or white... starts banging on my door and I felt threatened and I feared for my life, then, yeah, all right?
I-I think I would shoot.
Well, then remind me to never bang on your window.
Kenny, I didn't mean...
Dr. Alexander, Mr. Benedict is complaining about a migraine.
I'll be right there.
: It's gonna be okay, buddy.
We're almost there. You're doing great.
[Monitor beeping]
Sean?
Sean, stay with us!
BP's down to 82. Something must have opened up.
Damn it, I knew we should have gone first.
Hey, Paul, stay focused on what we can do now.
Sean needs the OR.
Let's just get him to the ambulance.
[Indistinct shouting]
You kidding me?!
Really?
What the hell are we gonna do now?
We're gonna have to find someplace to operate out here.
: Damn tear gas.
That stuff stings pretty bad.
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
How's he doing?
Not good.
He's gonna need surgery as soon as he gets in.
He's just a kid.
He only joined the force about three months ago.
Guy... guy barely shaves.
Yeah, I don't think the other kid does, either.
Well, that kid fired on us.
We didn't have a choice.
You think I feel good about that?
Nobody does!
I had to leave a patient back there.
I hate doing that. Okay?
Well, you were right to take David.
Yeah. Line of duty comes first.
[Cellphone rings]
[Beep]
[Breathes heavily] Hey, buddy.
Bad news.
The on-call surgeon, Dr. Clegg, is stuck across town in riot traffic.
No, h-he doesn't have an hour, Toph.
What's happening? What's going on?!
Scott'll be here in about 20.
We'll get him stabilized and prepped for surgery.
We're taking him straight to the OR.
I'll start, and then Scott can jump in in the surgery.
Great.
[Sirens wailing, yelling]
Should be just fine.
Let's go.
BP's dropping again. We got to hang another unit.
This is the last one, Scott.
He should've been on that chopper.
[Gunshot]
It's the police! Put your weapon down now!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were the cops.
[Rifle slides]
Show me your hands!
This is my store.
I swear, I thought you were looters.
I've been calling the cops to help me for hours.
Had shooters in my alley.
Hey, get a counter cleared off, and get these lights on for us.
All right, let's get him up here.
One, two, three.
Good.
Get a look at the shooter?
Yeah... black kid, blue hoodie.
That's what I called in.
Is this him?
Sean?
What, you know him?
Yeah.
He delivers sandwiches from the deli down on the corner.
[Voice breaking] Is he gonna make it?
[Coughs]
Breathe through this. Slow, deep breaths.
Exam 1.
Shannon, I got to get back inside and help with the overflow, so you're gonna be on your own.
Let me hear the drill one more time.
Patients with tear gas on them go in and undress.
Put their stuff in a plastic bag, then wash and rinse with clean water and get into clean clothes.
You sure you got all this?
I've got five younger siblings. It's called bathtime.
[Laughing] Okay.
Docs.
Got this little guy needs your help here. Found him wandering through some tear gas. Says his name is Charles. He got lost.
Take a seat there, Charles.
I'm Dr. Drew.
This is Shannon.
Hey, little man. Can I listen to your lungs?
[Shakily] I want my mom.
: Yeah, I know you do, buddy.
And she wants you, and she's looking for you, too.
We're gonna find her, all right?
: Drew, T.C.'s landing.
He wants you to make sure the OR is prepped.
Okay. Yeah.
Go ahead. I got this.
I don't care what the tests say.
I know there's something wrong with me.
My head is killing me.
Do you have a history of migraines?
Only in the last few months, and, um, trouble remembering things.
All right. Are your headaches usually this bad?
Oh, no. No, never this bad.
This is... this is really...
[Monitor beeping rapidly]
I need Ativan.
Grab Topher. I got this.
Okay, you got it.
Hey. Scott's stuck on-scene with the other GSW.
What?
The ambulance got trashed.
Chopper's gonna refuel and head back.
How's the kid?
Not good.
Scott's opening him up in some pawnshop.
Only one could go.
I had to make a decision. I made a call.
Listen to me. It was gonna be right or wrong either way.
Let's just hope they both turn out okay.
: We got bad news.
Dr. Clegg won't be here for another 30 minutes.
[Inhales deeply] Okay.
Looks like it's just the two of us.
Hey, how you holding up here?
Patients outnumber us 10 to 1, there's a missing child, media jackals are everywhere...
Dr. Zia, Benedict is crashing.
Got to go. I'll check in later.
: I-I-I called David's wife, Cindy.
She's on her way in, but she's devastated.
Yeah, that's a tough call.
Doc, no bull. What are his chances?
We got to get him prepped for surgery, and after that, we'll know more, but he's lost a lot of blood.
Hey, Drew, get Anesthesia to hang two units.
I'll be right there once I'm changed.
[Gasping]
Come on.
[Monitor beeping rapidly]
The Ativan isn't working. He's in Status.
What the hell? His head CT came back normal.
Checking another sugar.
No, we did check another sugar, and it came back normal.
Should I page Neuro?
No. Not yet.
Blood sugar undetectable.
Wait, what?
Give me D50.
Patient needs dextrose. Come on, come on.
[Monitor beeping steadily]
Okay, I want a dextrose drip at 100 CCs per hour and 20-minute glucose checks.
Why would his blood sugar plummet like that?
I have an idea.
Let's get a CT of his abdomen with IV and PO contrast.
Nice save, Jordan.
Thanks.
[Shouting in distance]
He seemed like an okay kid.
But he had a gun.
It's Texas. Everybody has a gun.
Open carry.
He was robbed before, so he wanted to protect himself.
Why do you think I have a shotgun?
: The chopper's close.
It's looking for a place to land, but the crowd's making it hard.
How can you not just get them out of here?
If we don't get him back to a hospital, he's gonna die.
And how would you do that? Shoot them? More tear gas?
It's called a riot for a reason.
He should've gone first.
Hey, Paul. Focus.
We got to stop this bleeding.
The bullet caused some kind of retrohepatic injury, but I can't tell what.
C-can we fix it?
With this equipment out here, no, but we can minimize the bleeding.
Hand me a Kelly clamp. We're gonna do a Pringle maneuver.
By clamping the hepatic artery and the portal vein... slow the bleeding down enough to get us to the hospital.
Exactly.
Place the clamp right... there.
Retract for me and reset.
Good.
It's working, for now.
Hey, what's the update on the chopper?
[Yelling]
[Gunshots]
Damn it!
Hey! Paul!
Paul!
Where are you going?!
Hey, stop! Stop this!
Hey, hey! Stop! Stop!
Stop! Hey!
What the hell do 
 want?
I'm the doctor trying to save the kid who was shot.
The kid that was shot by the cops?
The cop in there?
Hey, hey, hey... no!
We want to talk to him!
Stop it!
Stop! Get back!
No!
Don't take another step!
Everybody, put your hands behind your back!
Get down on your knees now!
Oh, no, no, no! Shoot me in the heart.
Or wait... maybe you want me to turn around so you can do it in my back, huh?!
I said get down on your knees now!
Oh, no!
Just do it!
No, stop, stop, stop, stop!
Do it!
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down.
Okay? He can help us.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
Yeah.
He was shot by the cops.
But right now, the only thing that matters is getting him to a hospital, or he will die.
That'll be just as much your fault as anyone else's if you don't let our chopper land.
He needs surgery.
You got to help us get out of here.
Hey.
You're the leader, right?
So lead.
Make them make room for us.
You heard the doc. Do it.
Come on, man.
Hey! Hey, over here!
Listen up! We got an injured brother there!
That was pretty badass.
We need to help them get him to the hospital!
Remind me that when I stop shaking.
[Indistinct shouting]
Is the "roadside racist" dead?
What about the officer? Can you give us his condition?
Is it true that an African-American shooting victim was left at the scene so you could attend to a white police officer?
Hey, hey, that did not happen like that!
We treat everybody the same.
: So he has been brought to the hospital?
No, he's on his way.
So he has been left in lieu of the white officer?
Hey, you're twisting everything. It was a medical decision.
It had nothing to do with any race.
The people in this ER dedicate their lives...
Man, Topher's getting eaten alive. to treating anybody... anybody who walks through those doors.
So the black kid isn't here?
: That crowd is getting angrier and angrier.
It was a medical decision.
Time to change that narrative.
Hey.
You're not listening!
Lies! Liar!
No patient is denied care for any reason!
For the last time, a medical decision is based...
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Hello!
Shannon.
Hi. I'm Dr. Shannon Rivera.
I'm an intern here, and I was hoping you guys could help us.
This is Charles.
He's 10 years old, and he was lost in the riots, and he would really like to find his mommy.
Can you help us?
Hey, Charles!
Charles!
What's your mommy's name?
Tiffany.
: Where do you live?
Okay. Thank you.
What does your mom look like?
Shannon, we have to go through Family Services when there's a lost child.
Yeah, when I called, they said they couldn't come for hours, which is ridiculous, so I started a hashtag... FindCharlesMommy.
You what?
It's already trending.
Don't worry. I linked Family Services.
We figured old-school media couldn't hurt, right?
Yeah, right.
: Dr. Rivera!
I've got a room all set up, and I found a lab tech going off duty to babysit.
Thanks, Jocelyn.
Yeah. Come on, Charles.
I'll check on you later, little man.
Don't forget your ice cream, sweetie.
So, I'll grab another patient?
You... Y-Yes. You do that.
Bullet number two.
[Monitor beeping]
That's number three.
Nurse, call SAPD.
Tell them they come pick up the bullets.
Yes, doctor.
Hey, guys, no sign of the fireworks slowing down outside.
What's the update here?
Bullets are out, but his inner lobe is shredded, and he tore his hilum... it's a mess.
What's the ETA on Scott?
Well, the chopper's just picking him up now.
He'll be here in 15.
[Monitor beeping rapidly]
He's fibrillating.
Okay, let's hang two units. He needs more volume.
Starting intracardiac massage.
Let's get the crash cart... now!
You see that spot right there on your pancreas?
It's a small mass called an insulinoma.
Like a tumor?
Yes. It excretes excess insulin, which lowers your blood sugar.
I'm assuming that you haven't eaten that much in the past few days, which lowered it to dangerous levels.
And that would explain your fainting, headaches, the seizure.
So, do I have cancer?
Tumors like these are rarely malignant.
However, you will need to have it removed, so we'll schedule a surgery for next week.
After that, you should be fine.
Well, that's too bad.
Most people take not having cancer as good news.
Yeah, well, most people aren't about to spend the rest of their life in prison.
I know, I know.
You probably think I deserve it.
I wasn't gonna say that.
[Chuckles]
[Voice breaking] You know, you're the first person I met since this whole thing happened that hasn't asked me if I was guilty or told me that I was.
That's not my business.
And I'm guessing, if you could, you would take it all back.
The shooting? No.
Because then I know I'd be dead.
I did nothing wrong.
I was under attack, and I defended myself.
I didn't shoot Bruno Mars.
I shot a massive, angry man who was going to kill me.
He just 
 to be black.
So, yeah.
And if I had to do it again, I would.
I can't imagine that sentiment would go over well with a jury.
Well, that's why my lawyers wouldn't let me testify.
See, I-I'm not afraid of the truth.
That's why I didn't mind talking to that nurse.
I'm just... a regular guy... who had a regular life, a job...
[Voice breaking] a family.
I mean, I-I've never been in trouble before.
I've never even had a speeding ticket.
Now I'm about to lose everything because I defended my life.
I'm sorry.
I'll let the Sheriff know that you're about to leave.
[Sighs]
Hey, Doc.
Yeah?
Thanks for the kindness.
I don't get too much of it these days.

♪ Oh, we get what we deserve ♪

♪ And way we down go-o-o-o-o ♪
Thank you.
You save his ass, young'un! You hear me?
We'll do our best.
Is he gonna make it?
I don't know. He's lost a lot of...
He's gonna make it!
There's no way we're letting him die! Let's go!

This is Sean Henderson.
Status... post-GSW to abdomen with his hepatoduodenal ligament clamped in the field.
BP's back down to 50 systolic.
Let's get him straight up to the OR. Tell them we're coming.
The cops are still in OR 1. The rest are filled with trauma victims.
Then we're doing surgery here. What's open?
Trauma 2, Trauma 2.
Open a laparotomy tray, set up for intubation, and find all the O neg you can.
Yes, Doctor.
Set up the rapid infuser. Get me a sterile gown.
How is he?
Not good.
Really bad, actually.
Sh-Should've been in the OR 20 minutes ago.
Yeah, well, maybe he shouldn't have drawn on my partner.
What if he didn't?!
What if you shot the wrong black kid in the hoodie?
He had a gun!
Which is his right.
Open carry is not just for white people.
Hey, don't put this on me.
I've been doing this for 15 years.
It was a riot. If somebody has a gun...
You have no idea what it's like out there.
I was doing my job.
Yeah, so was Sean.
He was returning from delivering a deli order.
So, the good news is, they found Charles' mom.
The bad news is, she's at St. Luke's with injuries from the riot.
Who takes their kid out in a riot?
She didn't.
She was caught in it coming home from work, and they got separated.
She's frantic to get him back, but there's no way to get him there until after this clears up.
Which could be who knows when.
How's he doing?
Eh, he's 10, he's scared, and he misses his mommy, but I set up a FaceTime so he got to see her.
Good job.
All right, so, keep working the decontamination tent, and we'll just keep him as comfortable as we can.
Topher, four more injured coming in, and we're almost out of O neg.
Damn it. Get on the horn and find us more.
Try St. Luke's.
: How many rounds of epi?
[Monitor beeping rapidly]
That was the fifth, and six units of blood.
Any cardiac activity?
No. Nothing.
Okay, shock again.
[Powering up]
Clear.
[Monitor beeps, hisses]
[Rapid beeping continues]
[Flatline]
Still nothing?
Asystole.
Tee.
Yeah?
[Sighs]
Yeah.
Time of death... 10:17 p.m.
Hey, we did what we could.
He was pretty much gone, though, the moment those bullets hit his chest.
Those .40s... they're bad news.
[Monitor beeping]
You're bypassing the laceration?
We have to.
The blood's pouring out of the vein too quickly.
Kelly clamp and a chest tube.
How's a chest tube help his bleeding vein?
Chest tube should shunt the blood back up to the heart if it works.
Scalpel.
How's it going?
Hail Mary time.
We'll know in about five minutes, after I suture this into place.
But if this doesn't restore volume to the heart, I'm out of options.
: Which is total BS.
We shouldn't even be in this position.
If... If T.C. hadn't taken that cop first...
Paul. who shouldn't have shot...
Paul!
That cop just died on the table.
Whatever happened out there, that's a man in uniform who lost his life doing a job that nobody wants to do.
So show some respect, okay?
[Exhales deeply]
Hey. How you doing?
Fine.
No.
Uh, not great.
I can break it to his partner. It's no problem.
No, it's all right.
I'll do it.
Just, uh, just gonna be a tough one.
Yeah, losing your partner, shooting a kid... that's a hell of a night.
It's gonna get a whole lot worse.
What do you mean?
When I was out there, I saw the kid's gun.
It was a .38.
The bullets we pulled from the cop were from a .40 cal.
So Sean, that kid... he didn't kill Rebecca's partner.
Rebecca did.
: Hey.
Thanks.
So, the Sheriff says the jury reached a verdict on Benedict.
They're gonna read it tomorrow.
He gets off, tomorrow's gonna be another long night.
[Scoffs] It's already been a long night, and we're only an hour into the shift.
Yeah.
Look, Kenny... about earlier, our fight...
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
That wasn't a fight. It was a spirited discussion.
[Indistinct shouting]
Hey. Don't worry.
I know your heart's in the right place... even if your head isn't.
[Shouting continues]
[Screaming, shouting]
Don't move. Don't move!
Come on, come on.
[Indistinct shouting]
Somebody shot him!
Get him over.
Oh, my God.
[Indistinct shouting]
Come on, Steven. Stay with us.
Pulse is weak.
Somebody page Neurosurg... now!
Bring the crash cart in here.
I need an intubation tray and 100 of Mannitol.
I lost his pulse.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
What the hell happened?
Some nut just shot Jordan's patient... that Benedict guy.
Here?!
Yeah.
Anybody else hurt?
Uh, no. They tackled the guy that did it.
Drew!
Yeah, okay. Uh, get her to CT.
How's your guy?
Uh, we got lucky. Looks like he's gonna pull through.
That wasn't luck.
He used a chest tube to bypass the IVC and shunt blood back to the heart.
What? That's hardcore.
It was a good team effort.
Anyway, he's not out of the woods yet.
All right, Nurse, take him up.
Get 4 units of blood in him before I do any more surgery.
Hey. Drew.
The cop that T.C. brought in...
Is there anything I could have done? Maybe saved him?
No way. His chest was a total mess.
Miracle he even made it here.
So T.C. made the right call, then.
Sean's gonna get charged with murder.
I don't think so.
[Voice breaking] I don't... I don't know how I'm gonna tell Cindy.
[Inhales deeply] They're expecting a baby.
If only I'd gotten to that alley sooner.
I could have taken that kid out before he...
Rebecca.
And you just watch!
He's gonna be fine! He'll live.
Okay, Rebecca. Hey.
There's something you need to know about the shooter.
What do you mean?
Sometimes, in the fog of war, things don't always happen the way that we... we want them to or that we think.
What are you saying?
I'm just saying that... that I've been there.
Okay?
The bullets we took from David's body... they were .40 cal.
Okay?
[Crying] No.
They were yours.
[Sobbing]
I'm sorry.
[Flatline]
Get the blood and the rapid infuser.
Hold CPR.
[Flatline continues]
Still nothing. Resuming CPR.
Give bicarb followed by another amp of epi.
[Grunting] Come on! Come on!
[Flatline continues]
Come on, buddy!
Kenny...
Kenny. Kenny, stop.
Come on! Come on!
Stop. Stop!
Come on.
There's brain matter.
[Sighs] We're done.
Time of death... 10:26.
[Flatline stops]
Make sure St. Luke's gives us all the O neg we asked for.
It's part of the trade.
Don't worry. I won't let those bastards cheat us.
Wha... Hey! Children.
Be back in 30 minutes. It's gonna be a long night.
Got it. Get the blood, take Charles to his mom.
I'm going to go see my mom?!
Mm-hmm.
How?
You ever ride on a helicopter?
No.
Well...
No way!
Yes way.
Now, I want you to take care of Dr. Rivera, okay?
I'm putting you in charge.
Thanks, Captain.
Let's get out of here, little man.
[Imitates takeoff]
[Laughs]
[Monitor beeping steadily]
Word on the street is that you were Superman out there tonight.
Yeah, I don't know about that.
I was scared to death.
Aw, man, anybody would have been.
Man, I probably would have cried.
I doubt that.
You know what else I was out there?
Pissed... at T.C.
The guy's been my hero, but... I have to admit, the thought did cross my mind...
Did he take the cop first 'cause he was white?
Aw, come on, man. You know that's not true.
Yeah. I know.
But did he take him in because he's another man in uniform?
Maybe.
I guess we all have our own unintended biases.
I know I've got mine.
Which are...?
Spoiled rich kids like you.
Why do you think I give you so much crap?
'Cause I'm an easy target?
Well, there's that. [Laughs]
Definitely that. [Laughs]
But honestly, uh... maybe I'm a little jealous.
I never had what you had, man, and I never will.
Yeah, man, but you could.
No, I can't.
You have a gift. You have a family.
I've got me.
And that's okay.
But no matter how successful or great a surgeon you become, I just never want you to lose touch with those that are less fortunate.
You know?
Yeah.
Look, I... I overreacted earlier.
Sometimes, the slights just build up, but I never should have taken that out on you, man.
I'm... I'm sorry.
I-I shouldn't have been so naive, you know?
Hmm?
Yeah.
Aw, man.
Sounds like we both have something to work on.
Yep.
Might want to wash the blood off of that before you put that back on.
I'm not putting it back on. I'm sending it back to my dad.
Really? Pretty nice piece of bling.
Yeah, I've realized it's just not me.
So... Rebecca's not gonna be charged, but I don't know if she's gonna recover from killing her partner.
Well, I've seen people recover from worse things.
Yeah.
You headed back out there?
It's only been a few hours, Toph.
We still got a long night ahead of us.
Hey, sorry about your patient.
Yeah, yours, too. Hey, be careful out there.
Yeah, you be careful in here.
Okay, people, we've got four traumas coming from the riots.
The first is rolling in right now...
32-year-old male...
I need a suture tray.
Two more right behind it.
Call Radiology. Let's get a c-spine film.
Let's get her to Curtain 3.
Let's stay focused, and we'll get through this together.
Take him straight to CT. We need Vascular.
I got this one. Curtain 4.
