Wait, what's going on, Andy?
It's time for you to go.
What are you talking about?!
You said I could stay a few days.
Yeah, a few days is a few days.
You've been here for two weeks.
Well, what am I supposed to do? Where am I supposed to go, Andy?
That's not my problem. I've done my part.
Oh, come on, man!
I thought you... I thought we were friends.
It's not even you, it's Tess.
She has trouble being sexually intimate when there's someone else in the house.
Oh, my God!
Could you not put that image in my head?
I mean, I'm trying to stay sober here, you know?
Yeah, you know, let me give you a little advice, Marc... it's life advice.
Traditionally, when people help you, you're supposed to say, "Thank you."
Mm-hmm. Here.
I'll give you a little life advice, Andy.
Lose the oversize shirts.
They're not working for you anymore.
Thanks. Thank you very much.
Sure, fatty. Yeah.
We're free!

What's up, big daddy?
How you feeling, man?
Hey, I saw you throw your hand up earlier.
You looking for a sponsor?
Uh, you know, I'm just coming back in.
Yeah, I had 16 years, went out...
It's cool, man. Don't worry about it. Uh, I'll be your sponsor.
I'm Chuck.
Ah!
Okay!
But my boys call me "the boss."
Boys, big daddy!
Hey.
Sobriety's a blast, man.
All right, well, you know, I'm... I'm sort of, uh, talking to another dude, so, you know, I'm...
I'm gonna...
I get it, man. You're scared.
Yeah.
But you want to know what fear is?
False evidence appearing real.
Yeah, yeah, I've heard that one.

Hey, how you doing, man?
Hey.
Hey, I saw you raised your hand at newcomer time.
There's no shame in that game.
You need a sponsor, right?
Uh, I don't know. I guess.
Well, we can call it a temporary sponsorship for now.
You know, we'll try it out, take it for a spin, see how she takes the corners.
Mm-hmm.
Well, actually, I'm... I'm just trying, you know, to get back in the swing of things, so, you know...
Cool. [Chuckles]
This whole deal must be weird for you.
Hey, I'm a big fan, by the way.
Actually, well, you probably hear this all the time, but, uh, I do a podcast myself.
Hmm.
Oh, actually, I just realized I have a recording of it.
It's called "Podcast Podcast."
Remember like the old commercial where the little guy would come out and say "pizza pizza"?

First thing my sponsor told me was, "Don't eat the birthday cake."
Yeah?
Yeah.
By the time the crackheads and alkies blow out the candles, it's not icing anymore, it's a creamy petri dish.
Oh, man, that's kind of disgusting.
[Laughs]
Why you still eating it, then?
I'm immune.
Mmm.
I'm like one of those guys who, uh...
Mmm! That's good!
...takes rattlesnake venom until the bites don't bother him.
Right.
Yeah.
After 30 years of gulping junkie germs, it doesn't affect me.
Got it.
Mmm. Yeah.
[Inhales] Gerry... with a "G."
Marc.
30 years, huh?
That's not nothing.
Yeah, thanks.
Now I pretty much come for the cookies.
I'm a sucker for that baked-last-century taste.
Right, right.
So uh... you want to sponsor me?
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Well, it's kind of a saga.
Shocker!
Give me the highlights.
All right.
Well, I had, uh, 16 years sober, I relapsed.
I kind of screwed up a big job, I lost everything.
I imploded publicly, and, uh, now I got no place to live.
Impressive.
What, that I have no place to live?
Most addicts, they're addicted to the drama.
You sounded like you were reading a bus schedule.
I know, right? I think I'm dead inside.
Mm!
That happens!
You keep doing what you're doing, you keep getting what you're getting.
Right, right, okay.
Mm, yeah.
My sponsor used to tell me just do the next right thing.
Okay, that sounds great. I'm in.
So what is it?
You don't know.
You can't... your brain's broken.
Everything you want to do is wrong.
That's why you have a sponsor, so you can take directions.
Okay, look, I... You want to do this?
Yeah, one addict helping another, that's what it's all about.
So, all right, what happens now, then?
Hmm.
Ah.
Let's take a ride.
Where?
Unless you prefer sleeping under the stars, I might have a cheap place for you to stay.
Hey, do me a favor.
Just keep filling this up.
They're gonna throw it away anyway.

Shirley, the place we're going, takes in recovering addicts.
She helps a lot of guys.
She's like a one-woman halfway house.
She helped me get sober. Yeah.
I was lost.
I don't really know how to say it, but, yeah, she was nurturing in a way.
Hmm.
Sounds weird.
Unless you have a better idea, I suggest going with sponsorial direction here.
Uh...

Hey.
Call me tomorrow.
You'll be staying in the guest house.
So did Gerry tell you why I take in you guys?
He just said you like to help people.
I do.
My own son died of an O.D. 30 years ago.
Hmm.
Nobody helped him, including me.
[Suitcase thuds]
[Chuckles] Wouldn't let him back in the house.
[Sighs] So after he died in a skid-row motel with a needle in his neck...
Ugh.
...I made a vow to help as many of you boys as I could... the way I wish I helped my own.
Uh...
This is a nice garden.
Oh, it's more than that.
Here.
Take this.
It's your sobriety bush.
Sobriety bush?
While you're here, 
 tend it.
You'll plant it, you'll water it, you'll watch it grow.
Learn to love this little guy, and you'll learn to love yourself.
Gardening is a big part of what you'll be doing here.
I call it Donny's Garden.
Hmm.
It's really, um...
I know.
I...
I know.

Um...
These are my only pants.
Fine, then you can start right now.

You threw me out of your house, Andy!
Now I'm living with some lady named Shirley in the dead son museum.
Wow, you're like my mother with the guilt.

The Sklar brothers wanted to know why you didn't return their calls about the podcast.

Because you have to get back out there.

Uh, well... w-whatever you guys want to know, you know?
I... I'll... let's just... let's just do it.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Uh, I'll start with something that I heard.
I heard that you were living in a storage locker.
Wait a minute, how do you know that I heard that. and I don't know that?
'Cause I hear things.
Okay, are we talking about an actual storage locker here?
Yes.
Yeah, but, I mean, the saddest part about it really was that...
Wait, wait, wait. Where did you sh1t...
Okay.
...in the storage locker?
Just take it easy.
Yeah, I want to know.
A bucket it. It was a bucket.
[Inhales sharply]
I mean, when you say it out loud or when he says it...
And when he repeats it twice, that's just sad.
Yeah, yeah.
A bucket. - That's just really sad.
Yeah.
But hilarious.
Kind of funny.
Kind of hilarious.
Also kind of funny, yeah.
I mean, have you been talking about this on stage yet?
No.
Please tell me.
No, I... I haven't even... st-started doing stand-up again yet.
What are you talking about?
Are you kidding?
You gotta go on.
You have so much to draw from now.
Yeah, but I'm just, uh... It's like I'm... I don't...
I don't know. [Chuckles]
All right, well, listen, hey.
W-We're headlining at the Ice House tonight, and there's an open slot in the show.
It's got your name on it.
Come on.
I think you should do it. Say yes, man.
Come on, look what we're doing right here.
This is a comedy intervention on this podcast.
That's all it is.
[Sighs]
Oh.
So I know it sounds sad that... that I was living in a storage unit, but th-there is some... some good parts to it.
Like, uh, I was running a small business out of the storage unit. I was...
I was, uh, actually selling my sh1t for drugs.
Hmm.
And once I ran out of my sh1t, then I... I, you know, I didn't steal.
I chose to, uh, to start a very healthy relationship with a woman who was taking care of a guy with cancer, and I would take his medicine.
And if you think it's, you know, hard to have s*x with someone you don't really want to have s*x with, try doing it on Oxys with a guy with cancer moaning in the background.
And I pulled that off, so that's something, right?
I'm kind of a hero.
Okay, all right!
[Claps] Whoo!
Marc Maron, everybody! Marc Maron!
Give it up!
For Marc Maron, everybody!
Come on!
Marc Maron!
First time he's been on stage since sh1tting in a bucket there.
Hey.

You want to get something to eat or something?
I mean, normally, absolutely, yes, we would do that, but...
Tonight we can't.
No.

Mm.
