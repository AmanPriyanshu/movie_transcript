Good. It was different.

It was fun.
Thank you.
What we do isn't so different from what you do.
I know what spies do.
You are going to go to Bible study every week so that not a day goes by without you seeing Pastor Tim and his wife.
Because, thanks to what you did, that is all that stands between us and this family being destroyed.
I'm going to talk to the Centre.
I'm going to tell them that it's time we ease up on you two.
No new operations.
This will be the closest you two have ever come to a vacation.
Okay, so, where should your hands be?
10:00 and 2:00.
Good. Adjust your mirrors.
Can you see behind you?
Yes.
How about this?

Uh... good.
Okay, so, now we're gonna turn on the car.

You don't have to hold the wheel so tight.
Just...

My kids, they're going crazy.
They do. All of a sudden, everything is, "Why, why, why?"
All the time... "Why?"
First, it was just Sue, but now all three of them doing like that.

"Why I have to do this?
Why I cannot wear that? Why I have to do that?"

They're just seeing how much they can get away with.
Ohh, they will not avoid punishment for anything when their grandmother is back.
She is old-fashioned like my mother.
She will not let them get away with anything.
She will make them stand still for their spanking before they even think to ask a question.
My mother was a tough one, too.

My mother was so creative with her punishment... never the same way two time.
One day, bend the knees, pinch your ear, and jump up and down in a circle.

The committee for the church's Ethiopia trip is having their last meeting next week.
Sort of a send-off for Pastor Tim and the other people he's going with.
Yeah, you should go to that.
We should all go to that.
Pastor Tim likes seeing us together.
