: Tonight, under the full moon, we will defeat the dragon.
With the force of 150 moon rings, I have no doubt we will succeed.
You really believe that?
: Weilan.
Let her speak.
The Eastern Pod threw all their moon ring power at the dragon and still couldn't stop it.
I'm sorry for what happened, Weilan.
But we are a strong, disciplined pod.
We're prepared to face the dragon.
That dragon is going down, and I can't wait to see it.
Your courage is a great asset to the pod, Ondina.
Which is why you will not be with us tonight.
Excuse me?
You and Mimmi have a more important role to play.
You'll watch the little ones in the caves.
You want us to babysit?
Any mermaid can look after hatchlings and tell them bedtime stories.
Ondina's right.
The pod needs the best and the strongest up front.
This task is too important to entrust to just any mermaid.
Veridia, please--
I will see you when it is over.
Babysitting. I can't believe this!
Ondina, if the elders fail tonight, you and Mimmi will have a great responsibility.
The young will need strong leaders to guide them.
That's why Veridia chose you.
The pod will not fail.
: The sea is so peaceful.
I hope it's still that way after the full moon tonight.
I'm sure the pod will deal with the dragon.
I know I'm only a... a part-time mermaid... but I feel like I should help.
You need to stay on land tonight, with me, okay?
We're going to have a quiet night watching movies and eating pizza.
Aren't you worried about Mimmi out there with that thing?
Of course.
But Mimmi says Veridia has a plan, and the pod are experts.
Let's just leave it to them.
There you go. Enjoy.
How much cheese did you put on that toastie?
Three slices. Makes it really yummy.
 Every cheese slice costs us.
You need to cut back.
Good idea. In fact, why bother with cheese at all?
There is a market for dairy-free toasties.
While we're at it, why not just cut out the tomato... and the bread?
I'm being serious. It's all about finding efficiencies.
What are you even doing here, Cam?
Shouldn't you be out saving lives?
I'm the co-owner, remember?
How could I forget?
We all need to do our bit to keep costs down. That's all I'm saying.
That'll be $7.50.
What?
"We all need to do our bit to keep costs down"?
You can't charge me, I'm the manager.
Not right now. You're off-duty, and I'm acting manager so, that'll be $7.50.
Keep the change.
You're cute when you get all huffy. Don't forget, date night tonight.
There is not a lot of room for the dragon in here.
Exactly. Once you lure it in, it has nowhere to go.
You turn the dragon's power back on it and--
No more dragon.
We hope.
You scared?
 No.
Yes.
Zac... I know you can do this.
But I wouldn't blame you if you backed out.
I won't.
Good.
Because the mermaid council think that moon rings can save them.
They're wrong.
Speaking of the pod, how do we keep them out of the way?
I'll take care of that.
What about Evie?
Don't worry. I have a plan to keep her occupied.
We can't afford any risks, Zac.
This is my girlfriend we're talking about. I would do anything to keep her safe.
Well, whatever your plan is, it better work.
Great view.
Yeah.
Are you guys okay?
Yeah.
Fine.
Okay, spill. What's wrong?
 Veridia doesn't want us to fight the dragon.
She's got us minding the little mermaids in the caves underneath Mako.
We can't help the pod by hiding in the caves like frightened squid.
If we aren't included, it's like everything we ever did in the past to save Mako was for nothing.
I agree. Let's fight.
Yeah, well you would say that.
Wait. What?
It's our pod.
We need to fight for it.
You're going to disobey Veridia?
We've done it before.
Count me in.
Veridia gave me a moon ring.
This is my fight too.
: When I was young, in the last days of my pod, I was taught a proverb.
When the dragon birth by moonlight rises, wait in the shadows... for to defeat the darkness, from the darkness you must come.
"Wait in the shadows..." the western side of the island.
If you hide in the shadow of Mako, when the dragon appears--
We can take it by surprise. We'll have the advantage.
Thank you, Weilan. You have done the pod a great service.
Sorry, mate. 
 I'm already booked.
Me and Carly are taking the tinny out for a moonlight picnic.
Cancel.
Are you nuts? She'll skin me alive.
I really need this, Cam. I wouldn't ask otherwise.
Please?
Okay. What do you want me to do?
Be at my place at 7:00. Bring Evie a pizza.
Just tell her I've been held up.
Keep her company till I get there.
How late will you be?
One movie.
Maybe two.
Two chick flicks. Great.
Just make sure she stays in the bungalow, that's your number one priority.
This is about the full moon, isn't it?
I'll give you the lowdown later, but right now I need you to trust me.
Do not let Evie out of your sight.
 Well, Carly's not going to be happy.
The pod will meet off Mako just before sundown.
We should get there as late as possible so Veridia won't have time to send us away.
: Okay.
I'll close up the shop, say goodbye to Dad and I'll meet you in the grotto.
Have you told Zac what you're doing?
Are you kidding?
If he knew, he'd do everything he could to stop me.
So how are you going to handle him?
Leave it to me.
Hi, Carly.
Hey, Evie.
Busy day?
Kind of.
I have a favor to ask.
Sure. What is it?
Zac's expecting me at the bungalow at 7:00.
But I'm not going.
All you have to do is show up with a large seafood supreme, tell him I'm busy with a shop delivery, and that I'll be late.
Don't let him leave.
Sorry, Evie. Cam and I have a date.
It's been planned for weeks.
You know I wouldn't ask if it wasn't so important.
Well, this is important, too.
Carly, this is really, really important.
What is?
Trust me. Please.
Some kind of major mer-business is about to go down, right?
I wish I could tell you, but--
No dice.
I'm your best friend. You want my help, it's full disclosure.
Carly--
Trust for trust.
I'm going to join the pod off Mako tonight to fight a 60-foot, magic water dragon whose sole purpose is to destroy mermaids.
Satisfied?
Why didn't you just say so?
Thanks. Finished work early?
Slow afternoon. David's got it covered.
Right.
About tonight--
Tonight's off.
You're canceling our date?
Yeah. I'm really sorry.
That's fine. Things happen.
So you're not upset?
No.
In fact, I was going to cancel, too.
Really?
Yeah.
Did you get a better offer or something?
What? Of course not.
No, I... Wait.
What's more important than hanging out with me?
What's more important than hanging out with me?
Nothing.
Right then, see you tomorrow.
Okay then.
Camster's off the hook.
The pod will be on the west side of Mako, well out of the way.
How do you know the dragon's coming from the east?
That's where the moon rises.
You know I'd come with you if I could.
You've done enough. Now it's my turn.
The dragon's not going to know what hit it.
It's getting late. We can't wait any longer.
Evie said she would be here.
She knows where we're going.
Oh, what about Weilan?
Without a moon ring, she's no use.
Hey, Evie.
What were you and Zac doing?
What?
I saw you with him.
Where's he going?
He's... going for a swim. 
He's supposed to meet me at the bungalow.
Then go wait for him.
I think you two are cooking something up.
We're not. Really.
Does it have to do with what you and Zac were doing on Mako?
No. Just leave it, okay?
You need to tell me what is going on!
It doesn't matter now anyway.
What doesn't matter?
Where has Zac gone?
He's going after the dragon... isn't he?
The pod said that they could destroy it!
The pod's plan won't work!
And you think you can do better?
Zac's a merman, that gives him an edge.
He's going to turn the dragon's power back on it.
How?
The eastern magic I was teaching him on Mako.
Is he going to fight the dragon on Mako?
Not on the island.
Then where?
The moon pool. 
Don't interfere, Evie!
Zac may be our only hope!
Evie!
We have never faced a threat like this... but our strength is in our unity.
Trust in that, and I have no doubt we will prevail.
I told you to look after the hatchlings.
They're being taken care of.
Right now, the pod needs every available moon ring.
And that means that you need us.
Prepare yourselves.
Zac?
Evie?
: Hello, Zac?
What are you doing here?
Likewise.
I asked you first.
Zac's meeting Evie but he got, uh, held up helping his dad... move a piano.
So he asked me to drop a pizza off and keep Evie company.
So, you ditched me to move a piano?
I was helping a friend. Any idea where Evie is?
Uh, Evie got stuck with a late delivery, so... she asked me to, um, keep Zac company until she got here.
It's quite a coincidence them both being late.
Yeah. Weird, huh?
Evie's not coming, is she? She asked you to cover for her.
A girl never betrays her best friend's confidence.
What about Zac? You're fronting for him, aren't you?
I resent the implication.
So are we just going to let these pizzas go cold?
Evie should be here by now.
 Get your mind in the game, Mimmi.
Veridia?
The moon has risen. Why are we waiting here?
By waiting in the shadows of Mako we'll have the element of surprise.
How do you know that?
Weilan told me.
Weilan?
Evie, what are you doing here?
You can't do this, Zac.
You need to leave, now!
What was that?
The dragon.
Oh... 
 it's coming. Get behind me!
Zac!
What?
He's with the dragon, in the moon pool.
Weilan sent us here so Zac could fight it.
Come on lizard breath, hit me!
You can do better than that!
Leave him alone!
Evie!
Evie? Talk to me, Evie!
Evie? Wake up, please.
Evie? Talk to me, please.
Evie.
Zac.
What happened?
 Where's the dragon?
It's okay. It's gone.
Evie?
My tail!
I'm not a mermaid anymore.
At least you're not hurt.
And the pod is safe.
It could have been much worse.
She's lost her tail.
How could it be worse?
I need to go home.
I'll walk you.
Nice work, Weilan.
I'm so sorry.
I never meant for anyone to get hurt.
No. You never considered anyone but yourself.
Ondina--
Face it, Mimmi.
She lied to Veridia to get the pod out of the way.
She lost our best chance at defeating the dragon.
The pod would have failed. I told you moon rings are no match for it!
Well, we'll never know, will we?
Because the pod never got the chance to use them!
If our plan had worked we wouldn't be having this conversation!
Correct.
Although, in case it slipped your mind, your plan didn't work!
The dragon is still out there.
Try to get some rest, Evie.
Come on, let's go.
It's okay.
I'll be fine on my own.
Are you sure?
Yes.
I'll see you tomorrow?
Sure.
