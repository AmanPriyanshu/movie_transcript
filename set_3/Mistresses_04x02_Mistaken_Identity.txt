I had no idea that you were all about s*x and sexy stuff.
Well, I wouldn't say that's all I'm about.
I actually have a question for Dr. Kim, as well.

I'm sorry, but we just don't have room.
How could you not have room for a class that I'm already in?

I care about being taken seriously in my field as an academic and a therapist, not a public expert on all things sexual.
Well, why do you have to be one or the other?
You're both, Dr. Karen Kim.
Why not just own it?

Are you sure I can't get you some, uh, tea?
Oh, I think it's best if I get to it.
Better for everyone.
Okay.
April, it's good.
[Sighs]
I am so happy you think so.
But it's not great.
Oh.
You know, one thing I've really learned since being on this board, it's always best to be honest, even brutally so.
Brutally, huh?
Your work just isn't at the level required to get into this program.
Now, listen. Now, don't get me wrong.
[Chuckles]
April, you can paint.
But...
You just don't seem to have "it."
I could recommend you, but you won't get in.
You're that sure, huh?
I'd feel like I'd be encouraging you to uproot your life in a way that won't benefit it.
Look, you have a beautiful store and a lovely family.
Your life seems really good.
Allow painting to be something that you enjoy recreationally.
But good luck with everything.
Thanks.

You sure you don't want to talk about it?
[Sighs] If I talk about it, I'll get teary.
If I get teary, I'll ruin my makeup, so...
Yeah. I'm sure.
Understated enough?
[Chuckles] It's beautiful.
Understated, classy... Just a backyard bash for two people who aren't speaking to each other.
So you still haven't made up with Harry?
Nope.
Kate?
Not so much.
What about Harry and Kate?
Uh, not speaking.
How is the night gonna work if no one's speaking to anyone?
And if we still can't say "engaged."
Alcohol may help.
You know what? I could use one, too.

[Indistinct conversations]
Great news.
I got into the band.
That's great, Marc.
And here I was thinking I was just an amateur who couldn't keep up, and they kept talking about my skill level and everything that I bring to the group.
Isn't that amazing?
Uh-huh. Amazing.
[Sighs]
Aren't you gonna ask how my meeting went?
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I totally forgot.
Well don't worry, because it went terribly is how it went.
Oh, come on. I'm sure you're exaggerating.
Start from the beginning.
Well, the beginning is that I only had two days to do it, and what was I thinking that that would be enough time?
And then when I finally got into a groove, I had to come and replace you in the store.
Wait, are you saying this is my fault?
No. I mean, I'm not saying it's not your fault.
She did mention that it looked rushed. So maybe if my thing had mattered as much as your thing, this would have turned out differently.
That's what I'm saying.
I need a refill.
So, how's the search going?
Find the right guy?
[Scoffs] No.
But I actually needed to apologize to you.
I shouldn't have brushed off your advice earlier.
You were just trying to help.
Please, you don't have to apologize.
Joss means well, but sometimes she can choose the wrong approach.
True.
But she did give me your book, which I read very quickly.
Oh, God.
This book is gonna be the end of me.
That part about the hotel makes what I'm doing look so innocent.
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
The point is, I think the book is great.
You've lived quite a life.
With you being open and honest about your mistakes helped me take a step back and realize what I need to let go of.
And what I need to hold on to.
I'm glad to hear that my story actually helped someone.
Reading you book was like therapy for me... but cheaper.
[Chuckles]
I should go talk to Joss.
Oh.
♪
I hope you're not hiding in here because of me.
Because I... I was drunk last night. Like, pbht, super drunk.
I noticed.
I was so over the line with everything that I said about you and Harry.
It was really all my stuff, you know.
Well, let's just say that apparently you weren't over the line, because everyone thinks it's weird, and now I think it's weird, and now this party feels like a funeral.
[Doorbell rings]
[Indistinct conversations]
Why don't I get that.
Mm-hmm. Interesting.
I wouldn't have paired the blue cheese with the tuna myself.
But, hey, everyone's got to make their own judgement calls, right?
Come on. Let's get you another cocktail.
Sure.
So how did your meeting with Mr. Moneybags go?
Fine.
He showed up, made some suggestions about the bistro, and then took off.
Haven't heard from the guy since.
That was probably for the best.
You don't get to where that guy is without doing some bad stuff.
Well, at least I can go back to the original plan and finance this baby myself, right?
Cheers to that.
Yeah.
And now that I got into the band, we can rethink the whole livemusic thing, huh?
Uh, we were thinking maybe we should get dinner started soon.
Fine by me. Though I'm not particularly hungry.
How many of those have you had?
12. Mm-hmm.
Ah.
Why don't I just take this?
Mnh. Mnh-mnh!
I'll tell the caterer.
Well, this is fun.

Is this what all American parties are like?
: I could grab my guitar, maybe... liven things up a little bit.
Maybe you should get the whole band to come.
: Oh, I know. Who wants to see photos of Vivian again?
Anyone? Robert just sent me a video.
[All groan]
I've seen Vivian. I want to see pictures of that hot manny that you're still not sleeping with.

[Sighs] Okay, you know what? Enough of this.
[Glass clinks]
: No offense to my friends, but this is the worst engagement party I've ever been to, and that's including my last one.
More wine, anyone?
I know that you all think that it's really weird that I'm marrying my ex-brother-in-law.
Okay? I get it.
Um, but I honestly, truly... I don't care, because you know what? I've never, ever been a person that cared what anybody thought about them, and it straight-up feels crazy that I allowed myself to do it now, especially when it comes to you, Harry.
I love you with all my heart, and I want every single person at this fricking table to know how much I love you, okay?
Joss.
And I know that we had a really messy, confusing, you know, complicated start, but it brought us... it brought us here to this moment, and I... I wouldn't change it for the world.
Because that's our story.
[Voice breaking] And I'm sorry, but you've made me happier than anyone or anything, ever...
♪
Hear, hear.
Mm.
[Glasses clink]
I love you.
I love you.
What's this?
[Sighs] What does it look like?
Look, I... I promised you that I'd help you and I bailed.
If I had been here, you would have had more time...
I shouldn't have blamed you, Marc.
It's not like I was gone for a day. It was an hour, and I don't think more time would have been helpful.
What do you mean?
[Sighs] I'm done with this, with art.
It's not me. I thought it was, but I was wrong.
Come on. You can't just quit.
There are months that I played guitar so much, my fingers bled.
And now, somehow, I'm in a band...
A real band that people have heard of.
Not many, but still.
But that's just it.
I don't want to bleed for it.
Not anymore.
April.
It's okay to let go of some of your dreams to whittle your life down from the things you want to the things you have that already make you happy.
I was an artist once.
But it's not who I am anymore.
You sure about this?
Yeah.
Now I can focus on spending time with Lucy.
Soon, she'll be way too cool to even talk to me.
[Chuckles]
[Sighs]
: Hey, Noel.
I thought you weren't allowed to hang around boys.
I'm not. I changed your name in my phone to Peyton.
That's who she thinks I'm talking to all the time.
What if she finds out you did that?
Please.
My mom's the worst with technology.
She still uses Siri.

Hey, slugger.
What's up?
It's a gift from Jonathan.
Hmm.
Whoa!

Nice Scotch, buddy.
Yeah.

Hey, look at this. Oh, wow.
It's a little mock-up of the bistro.
Huh.
Aww.
Guess he's interested after all.
[Chuckles]
Looks like someone has a crush on you.
[Both chuckle]
He's not the only one.
Is that right?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah?
[Both chuckle]
[Knocking]
So I obviously can't cook like you, Harry, but I'm great at take-out, and I was hoping these would somehow make up for how I've been acting.
Well, I will graciously accept your burrito.
I admit that it's helping a little.
Agreed.
And there's something that I need to tell you both.
[Sighs]
Brian had an affair.
Brian.
The guy who talks to little animals cheated on you.
Yeah.
And I had this stupid idea that if I did it, too, then somehow we'd be even.
Because that's all... That's all that Brian wants, for us to move forward and be together.
But after last night, I realized...
I want what you guys have, which is why I called off the wedding.
Oh, Kate. I'm so sorry.
You sure about this?
[Voice breaking] Yeah.
[Sighs]
But the good news is, um, I've decided I'm going to stay here.
No point in going home to my... my broken life in Sydney.
I'm going to stay here and find the true love of my life.
Here.
In L.A.
[Chuckles]
Hey. How did it go at the, uh, s*x Stop?
You glad you did it?
Actually, I am.
It was pretty great.
I forgot how good it feels to share my expertise, and I learned what a demisexual is.
Oh. That's good to know. Might come in useful in the future.
Wait. I want to... thank you for saying what you said the other day. You were right.
I can be a sexpert and a doctor.
They're not mutually exclusive.
Who cares if some people have a problem with it?
Not everyone's gonna agree with what you choose to write about.
Look, what people do after they read your book, that's on them.
You can't be responsible for anyone else's bad decisions.
Just my own, right?
