All right, stop your stretching.
We're gonna watch the movie "Bloodsport".
Not that I'm complaining, but isn't that, like, wildly inappropriate and has nothing to do with gym class?
"Sports" are in the title. Leave me alone.
I got nothing left to give you kids!
You did this to me!
All right, boys and girls, today begins Freshman Fear Week.
[Students gasp]
This is when upperclassmen hunt down terrified incoming ninth graders and throw them in the showers.
Did he say "hunt"?
Balls!
No! I made it through middle school without using those showers!
[Chuckling] Oh, yeah. 
I swear, one day, they'll realize this whole practice is completely barbaric.
You will never live to see that day!
But... you're my brother. You're supposed to protect me.
Opposite!
I've been training for this my whole life.
Every headlock, noogie, and wet willy has led to this moment.
There has to be a way out of this.
There is, but it's not pretty.
Mama! Barry's gonna hurt me!
I'm here, Schmoo.
He's gonna hunt me down and throw me into the gross gym showers!
No!
Yes!
No!
And then he's gonna rip my shoes off and make me touch the floor without flip-flops!
You're not athletic enough to get athlete's foot!
Help me! I'm just a boy!
[Gasps] I got you, baby.
Oh, God! No, I don't.

Hey, guys.
Still looking for contributions for the time capsule.
So far, we've got one Hall & Oates poster, put in by me.
I'm gonna put in a naked picture of myself so I can look back and say, "Yeah, Naked Rob had it."
I'm gonna put myself in there.
Boom! Livin' in the future.

You're funny and have trouble making eye contact with girls.
I like it.
All except for the haircut and the posture, but I can fix that.
Thanks, I think? Hey, Erica!

You want to sign my yearbook?
I saved you precious real estate right next to my face.
Fine.
Yeah, you know, if you need some more time with it, you could just give it back to me.
Okay, you're done. "Have a summer."

Geoffrey, Andrew, Robert, I need to speak to my child.
She's using our proper first names.
Move it.
It's scary 'cause she said "Andrew."
What?!
I didn't even do anything!
Adam says you're gonna haze and humiliate him at school?
Oh, that. Yeah, that's happening.
Like heck it is!
You lay one finger on my baby...
You mean the pubescent monster standing next to you?
Take a look at him, Ma. He's all grown up now.
That is not... the, uh...
No, that's not...
Is this true?
No! Look at me!
Actually, don't.
Uh, close your eyes and imagine me from last year.
Oh, my God!
He's right. My baby is going to high school.
No! Stop reeling at the passage of time!
Protect me!
Your voice!
I'm just now hearing it for the first time.
It's like the last gasp of an old helium balloon.
[Softly] No.
Oh, yes.
I just broke Mom's spirit, so now I can shower you.
Get ready, bro.
Shhhhhhhhhhh.
Why are you shushing me?
That's not a shush. That's a shower sound.
What are you talking about? This is a shower sound.
Kwwwwwwwhhhhh!
That's the ocean, bro. A shower sounds like this.
Shhhhhh!
You're making a fool out of yourself!
Listen to me. Listen.

Oh.
Hi.
Hello.
Don't mind me. I'm just having some Bev time.
[Sniffs]
Do you mind closing the door, please?
Mur? Your wife is sitting in the broom closet, sniffing a baby blanket.
That's her thing.
She sits in there and sniffs them to remind her of when our children were babies and not the worst.
And that doesn't bother you?
What do I know? I'm just the husband.

Fine.
[Sniffing deeply]

That's good blankie.
Bevy, I know it's hard with Adam going into high school, but you can't hide here in the closet forever.
[Sighs]
You're right.
Just... Just take this thing and put it where I can never find it.
It's time to let go.
It doesn't appear like you are.
I'm letting go.
I shouldn't have to struggle like this.
Set me free.
Al! Will you help me?!
She's got superhuman strength!
Take it! I'm handing it over.
She's got the forearms of a tennis pro.
Take the blankie.
Put your back into it.
Cure me of my sickness.
Are you okay, Taz?
No, man! I'm so wet, I'm so cold.
They didn't even give me a towel.
If they can throw Taz Money in the showers, there's no hope for us!
We just have to come up with a plan before the bell rings.
It's too late!

Why is he shushing us?
No matter what happens, we go down together.

Oh, your Nana is so sweet... but... wrong.
If you're any Donnie, you're Donny Osmond.

What is this? You look insane.
You haven't by chance seen a baby blanket...
Uh, blue, soft, precious beyond measure...
You know, a standard blankie?
You mean that gross, blue rag that smells like chickenpox and nightmare sweat?
You shut your face-mouth! But, yes, that's the one.
Okay, don't freak out... but I took it.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
I wrapped it around a New Kids plate and put it in a time capsule!

Sad and creepy.
This will force you to go cold turkey.

No.
Yes.
No way.
All people will remember all summer is my crazy mom digging up the school's front lawn.
Good idea. You be my lookout.
Don't even put that thought in your mind.
Too late. Look in my eyes, Erica.
It's locked in.
Come on, I need you.
If you do this, I promise, next year, I will not go storming down to the school.
Seriously? My whole senior year without my crazy mom roaming the hallways like a blond ghost?
That's what I'm promising.
We dig during first period, while everyone is still half asleep in class.
Understand?
You have my word, boop.
You will not humiliate me more than normal.

Nice move, Duckie.
I'm not Duckie! It's romantic.

Hey, man, how's your back?
A little sore, but I'm on the mend.
Thanks for asking.
That wasn't 
Ha! You got flipped on your ass like a turtle.
[Laughs]
JTP, I need your counsel immediately.
Um... is it cool if we talk after school... or later this summer?
Yeah, the thing is, you got body-slammed by a middle schooler, which makes you lower than a freshman now, so we have to keep our distance.
You get it.
You guys can't blow me off. I'm your leader. JTP!
What the hell?
You're supposed to automatically repeat "JTP".
Has the entire school turned on me?
We need to talk.
Oh, God, you're breaking up with me.
No, of course not. Yet.
We just need to undo what happened.
Right. Easy.
So, just lure Adam into a public space and dispense a swift beatdown for all to see.
Done. Quick question.
Is there anything else I can do that doesn't require me going near him?
Why?
I'm, like... How would you put it?...
Very afraid of him.
Adam, your nerdy brother, who dives for cover when someone pops a balloon?
Correct.
This is a lot.
Congrats. Your little stunt broke the water line leading to the locker room.
You ruined both Freshman Fear Week and a timeless tradition started by the great William Penn himself, who, after he founded this institution in 1689, immediately threw a freshman into the showers!
[Clears throat]
Oh, yeah, and, uh, there are some people who are also very upset about their pet project.
Yes, I am upset.
Everything in the time capsule was completely ruined.
Yes!
Oh, everything except this one thing.
No!
We should throw that away just to be fair.
Oh, I think this is for you.
"For future wife Erica Schwartz. Love, your future hubby"?
Really, dude?
Aww.
Awkward.
Geoff, for the millionth time, I don't like you that way...
Not now, not in the future, not ever.
So I really am the Duckie.
The dork from "Pretty in Pink"?
Yes, that's a great example. That's exactly who you are.
I think Duckie's cute.
Thanks.
Okay, this conversation's gotten away from me.
Let's just wrap it up.
Both of you are suspended for the day.
Called your parents.
They're on their way to pick you up.
Message received. Come on, Schmoo.
Buh-buh-buh-bip! I called your husband.
I'm suspending you from parenting for the day.
Nice try, but Murray won't care unless money's involved.
Here's the bill.
Are you kidding me?! 600 bucks for a broken pipe?!
Well... the headline here is, I saved Blankie.
[Chuckles]
Sure, it's lost its Adam smell, but I'll just recharge it.
You can't recharge a blanket.
Ho-ho! You bet I can!
I'll just sneak it into his pillowcase or mix it in his hamper like a stew.
Don't do that. Don't make a hamper stew.
I just... I need the blanket.
Once they grow up, it's all I'll have.
Look, I know how hard this is for you.

Why not?
'Cause I'm enjoying my leisure time.

Hey, I needed a win!

I lost my girlfriend, puberty was not kind to my body, and I got pantsed on the pull-up bar, undies and all!
And then you tried to kick me when I was down!
No! I was trying to help you!
By throwing me in the showers?!
Yes, idiot!
Only the cool kids get hazed during Fear Week.

Summer what?

There is?
Yes.
