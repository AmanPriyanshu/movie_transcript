: You know.
The Professor's taste is a little dark and masculine, but it kind of suits you.
Thank you.
Oh.
Yeah.
Jane, you need a break.
I mean, a home is a refuge... a place where you're supposed to get away from your problems.
Till some psycho burns it down.
I brought breakfast.
Okay.
A delicious quinoa, zucchini, and chia-seed quiche.
I'd rather eat the bag.
[Chuckles] The quiche is for me.
You... really?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, well, you keep bringing doughnuts, you can pop by anytime. [Chuckles]
Hey, did you go to the doctor?
I did. No change.
Well, that's good, right?
It is.
No further cognitive loss.
I'm experiencing a little dizziness, but, um...
Whose house is this?
R-Really?
Oh...
I pranked you. [Chuckles]
You believed me. I pranked you and you believed me!
I did.
[Laughs]
I really did.
I can't believe you kept that up for an hour.
I know.
[Cellphone vibrates]
Wait, have... I've been here for an hour?
[Cellphone beeps]
It's O'Connell.
[Vibrating continues]
Okay, I'll be right there.
[Cellphone beeps] Dr. Isles.
Wait, did Detective O'Connell find something?
I don't know.
They're tailing somebody that they think is Alice's money man.
Okay, I'll lock up.
Okay, thanks.
[Door opens]
I am on my way right now.
[Cellphone beeps]
Mmm.
[Title music]
[Bird cawing]
: Detective.
Are you leading the investigation?
This is my first as primary for the Fatal Accident Investigation Team.
Well, good for you. You deserve it.
Watch your step.
Thank you.
The victim is Layla Jalbani, freshman at Pemberton College.
I'm not sure what she was doing up here.
There's no alcohol or drugs in the vehicle.
And I didn't notice any skid marks.
There weren't any.
It's like she didn't even try to brake.
Well, maybe the brakes weren't working.
She had to have been going pretty fast to smash through the guardrail.
It's an older car, so no airbag or structural support.
[Police radio chatter]
She didn't stand a chance.
Cause of death appears to be traumatic brain injury.
So... an accident?
I don't see anything else to make me think otherwise.
We'll just do a full work-up of the vehicle and check the driver for drugs and alcohol.
Should I do the notification?
I'll do it.
It's part of the job, right?
[Music]
Hey.
[Door closes]
This is the guy we've been watching.
His name is Marvin Holtz.
He's a high-end CPA that we've connected to some of Sands' shell corps.
We suspect Holtz is the financial brains behind her operation.
How long's he been here?
About a half hour. There's no reason a guy like that should be visiting a dump like this.
All right, well, if Alice Sands is up there, she's not gonna come quietly.
We've got guys at every exit.
She's not going anywhere.
Maybe you should let us handle this.
You don't want to go in there angry.
I'm not angry. [Chuckles] I'm way past angry.
[Music]
[Bag unzips]
[Gun cocks]
Gun!
[Gunshot]
[Gun cocks]
You okay?
Yeah, thanks.
: Clear!
[Door creaks]
The place is empty. She's not here.
Then what the hell was he doing here?
Making a withdrawal.
[Door creaks]
We didn't get Alice, but we got her money. Hm.
[Footsteps approach]
Layla's parents?
They just drove in from Springfield.
 identify Marcus after he died.
That must have been awful.
Yeah.
You keep telling yourself it can't be real.
Sometimes I forget that you went through that.
Well, I'm doing better at putting it behind me.
Hey. I think you're doing great.
Look, look. Look what he's done to our girl.
Amir, Amir.
He must pay.
Amir, please!
Hey, hey, hey.
He won't get away with this!
What's going on, here?
He killed her. He killed my Layla.
Apparently Layla's life was threatened recently.
The Jalbanis don't believe that the car wreck was an accident.
They believe their daughter was murdered.
Layla was to be the first in our family to graduate from university.
You must have been proud.
She worked so hard.
Too hard, maybe.
[Sighs] I mean, she was sheltered.
I mean, that's why she took up with that snake.
He took advantage.
Layla was smart, but she was also very naive.
This ex-boyfriend of hers, what was his name?
Brian McDonald.
He was older than her, and he had been in jail.
Right away, we could see the changes in her.
She had such a bright future in front of her.
She was going to do great things.
So, Layla ended the relationship with Brian?
She came to see us right after. Uh, she was so upset.
Uh...
He threatened her.
He said he would kill her.
Mr. Jalbani, from what we know, Layla died in a car accident.
Listen. Brian McDonald is a mechanic, 
 all the time when they were together.
He could have done something to the engine or cut the brakes.
If Layla's car was tampered with, we'll figure it out.
You have my word.
[Music]
The bullet passed between the clavicle and first rib.
It struck and perforated the right peronial vein and the right thoracic artery.
[Clears throat]
The bullet then went through the apex of the upper lobe of the lung.
[Clear throat louder]
[Beep]
Is there a problem?
It's just that you said the, uh, peronial vein, which is...
In the leg... I know where the peronial vein is.
Brachiocephalic... the brachiocephalic vein.
I must be tired.
[Door opens]
Hey, did you get anything on the CPA?
Uh, yes. Cause of death... his gunshot wounds to the stomach and the chest.
Yes, I know. I was there for that part.
Okay, do you always stare at her like that?
'Cause that's just creepy.
I could stare at you instead, if you like.
I did find one thing unusual.
The victim was shot from the front, but I noticed red droplets on the back of both his neck and his shirt.
Well, how'd the blood get back there?
Not blood... bovine myoglobin.
It comes from beef that's already been drained of blood.
I analyzed those droplets, and the size and shape indicate that they could have come from a... a cutting saw.
So Holtz could have been in a butcher shop or a slaughterhouse... something like that?
Possibly.
Okay. Thanks.
Uh, Jane, wait.
When's the last time you had a meal?
[Scoffs]
Jane, if you want to catch Alice Sands, you have to be at your best, which means taking care of your body and finding ways to relieve the stress.
Okay, I'll eat something later.
Right now, I need to find a connection between a CPA and dead cows.
[Door closes]
[Music]
Layla's ex works at an auto-repair shop over on Bellflower.
Any priors?
Oh, a couple of drunk and disorderlies... nothing serious.
Any indication he messed with her car?
Uh, Maura says it was so damaged that there's no way to be sure.
I talked to her roommate at the college.
She said Layla seemed stressed out lately, but they weren't close. Layla wasn't even around that much.
Well, I'll talk to the ex tomorrow.
Here you go. Sorry for the wait.
Oh.
Thanks.
Can I get you guys anything else?
Jinx.
[Both laugh]
Hey, Nina, how's your shoulder healing?
Still hurts, but it's not slowing me down.
What about you? I heard about Ron.
I'm sorry.
Oh, thank you.
The Rizzolis aren't doing so hot in relationships this week, are we?
Well, we've done better, Ma.
I broke things off with Nicole, so...
I thought you really liked her.
Yeah, she's nice, you know?
Yeah, it's just... it's just, you know, I realized...
You know what?
I'll get that Thousand Island dressing for you guys.
Thanks, Ma.
You're welcome.
[Clears throat]
[Music]
[Siren wails] It's a total loss.
Jane!
[Gasping]
[Gunshot, screaming]
Hey.
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah. Maura just said that, uh... that I should find some ways to relieve stress, so...
Yeah, we all should.
Yeah.
[Panting]
Okay, well, I'm gonna... I'm gonna get dressed.
Jane.
Yeah?
When we find Sands, what are you gonna do?
Whatever's necessary.
[Music]
What's up? You find something?
I cross-referenced Marvin Holtz's known associates.
No connection to a butcher shop or anything like that.
Closest thing I found was a deli on East Concord.
East Concord?
: That mean something to you?
Yeah.
Uh, when the drug-unit guys were following Holtz, he would stop every day for a bagel at the same place on East Concord. "Newsom's."
That's the brother-in-law's place, but it's not a bagel shop.
It's a deli.
Call O'Connell. Tell him to meet us there.
[Keys rattle]
You can't just come in here.
Sir, I ask you to step aside.
Back's clear.
Upstairs.
Copy.
[Doorknob rattles]
Go for it.
So it seems.
We've got her, Jane. It's over.
[Music]
[Music]
She's trying to get inside your head.
Alice is a master manipulator, like Charles Manson or Jim Jones.
She has the instinct of finding vulnerabilities and exploiting them.
Well, good luck with that.
I mean, we found her red-handed with the rifle that shot Nina.
We don't know that yet.
Well, we read her her rights and she's asked to talk.
Wha... you heard her.
Jane, don't.
You're giving her what she wants.
[Door opens]
I remember you so well from the police academy.
You loved being the best.
You loved making everyone else look bad.
That all was in your head.
I think there's a lot of crazy sh1t in your head.
I'm curious, though. You had a successful drug network that you kept under the radar for years.
Why would you risk all of that just to come after me?
The thing about prison is it gives you time to think... to examine your life.
I finally understood that the path of my life would have been completely different if it weren't for you.
But... we barely knew each other.
You stole what should have been mine.
I came from a family of cops.
Everyone should have looked up to me, not some plumber's daughter.
You know what I remember about you?
Tell me.
Nothing.
The law... this whole notion of right and wrong... you've given your whole life to it, haven't you?
I have.
What good has it done?
You're alone. You've been through hell.
You've endangered your family and friends.
 has anything really changed?
Have you actually accomplished anything?
I'm putting you behind bars. That feels pretty good.
How will that change anything?
These crimes that you're accusing me of orchestrating... they all started when I was in jail.
So, if I was involved... why would prison stop me?
[Knock on door]
[Door opens]
Her attorney's here.
Hi. Phillip Dayton.
[Door closes]
Are the cuffs really necessary?
They didn't match.
The ballistics?
I ran the tests twice to be certain.
The rifle that Jane found next to Alice Sands is not the one that shot Nina.
[Handcuffs click]
So we still don't have a single piece of physical evidence to tie her to the shooting?
This conversation's over.
We were done anyway.
Goodbye, Jane. I really enjoyed our chat.
[Door opens]
[Music]
[Drill whirring in distance]
Brian McDonald?
Yeah?
I'm Detective Frank Rizzoli.
I need to ask you a few questions.
[Grunts]
You dated a young woman named Layla Jalbani, right?
If she said I did anything to her, she's lying.
What makes you think she'd say that?
Look, I lost my temper, all right? It was stupid.
But I called her. I told her I was sorry for being a jerk.
She said she understood.
I'm investigating a car accident that Layla was involved in.
Is she okay?
No.
I'm sorry. She didn't make it.
[Exhales sharply]
Oh, man. No.
I told her she shouldn't be driving that car.
Yeah, I heard you worked on her car.
Wait, did her parents say something?
Did they say I did something to her car?
I'd never hurt Layla. I loved her, and she loved me.
And her parents... now, they were the problem.
What kind of problem?
Uh... uh, you know, she was always trying to, uh... to live up to this image they had of her.
And then she... she started having trouble in school.
I thought Layla was an excellent student.
[Scoffs]
I just... I... I know things were, uh... they were getting tough for her lately.
[Clears throat]
You know, you might want to, uh... you might want to talk to her best friend, Carmen.
She knew Layla better than anyone.
All right.
Well, thanks, Brian.
Yeah.
We'll be in touch if we need anything.
[Music]
[Elevator dings]
It's bullshit... an indictment should be a slam-dunk.
I know, but Phillip Dayton knows how to work the system.
He convinced the judge to hold a probable cause hearing.
Well, we have enough for probable cause, right?
I watched her hand that guy a gun and tell him to shoot that kid.
And I'll have you testify to that.
I just wish we had some physical evidence 
But your testimony will put Sands behind bars, at least for a while.
I still can't believe Layla's gone.
These were all her things?
Yeah. She kept stuff at my dorm.
She studied there a lot.
Her roommate always had people over.
Well, I spoke to her ex-boyfriend, Brian.
Hm.
He said she was having a hard time.
She flunked a couple of tests, which really upset her.
You know, she was failing three classes.
Any idea what the issue was?
I think it was too much pressure for her.
Do you mind if I hold on to this?
Keep it all.
Looking at it just makes me really sad.
Dr. Isles, I just took a call for you from Dr. Halperin.
Yes, thank you.
I know Dr. Halperin.
He specializes in traumatic brain injury.
Uh, yes, that's correct.
I had some questions about the Layla Jalbani case.
No, you didn't.
Maura, please. Whatever this is, you can trust me.
I can help you.
The night of the shooting, I suffered a subdural hematoma.
It's stable, but there has been some slight cognitive loss.
Any further loss of consciousness, nausea?
Slurred speech, trouble walking?
No.
Right. Well, that's good, then.
So, what can I do?
No one can know... not yet.
Right now, I need the lab focused on finding the evidence to put Alice Sands away forever.
Understood.
But just so we're clear, my focus is also gonna be on helping you.
In particular, the sworn testimony of veteran homicide detective Jane Rizzoli.
Detective Rizzoli's testimony can't be trusted, Your Honor.
Alice Sands is a convicted criminal.
 with the shooting of a police officer last week.
Then they just dropped those charges 
We have witnesses inside the tunnel who can confirm Sands ordered the shooting of one of her employees.
What witnesses?
Your Honor, I have in my hand signed affidavits of every single person at that scene.
This is not happening.
It's not over yet.
They all say the same thing.
Ms. Sands never gave that disturbed young man a gun, and, in fact, begged him not to pull the trigger.
Ms. Lynne, do you have any evidence to present other than Detective Rizzoli's testimony?
No, Your Honor, but Detective Rizzoli has...
Then I have no choice.
But until then, I find there was not probable cause for the arrest.
[Gavel bangs]
[Indistinct conversations]
: You got to find some way to hold her.
Give me 48 hours at least.
I'll do what I can, but if it looks like harassment, the judge will just throw it out.
I'm sorry.
[Music]
 it was kind of sudden, wasn't it?
Not really.
We're just... different, that's all.
Really?
Ma, Nicole was fun, but, I don't know, we're just not right for each other.
I just wonder if it's because there's somebody else you might like... 
 and Thousand Island dressing as much as you do.
Nina? No.
Maybe. But [Sighs] nothing can come of it.
Why not? She's great.
Yeah, she's great, but she's my friend and we work together.
A million things could go wrong.
So you're not even gonna try?
But if you don't take a risk, how the hell are you ever gonna know?
Ma.
What?
Turn it up.
I'm just thankful that justice was done here today.
I really hate that bitch.
How many times has she targeted innocent victims with her wild accusations?
The Boston Police Department needs to launch a full-scale investigation of Detective Rizzoli.
Nobody's gonna buy that garbage.
This woman has gone after my home, my friends, my job.
And now she's going after my reputation?
So what do you want to do?
Keep digging.
Okay, the only place that Alice has made a real mistake is here.
Yeah, that's our best shot at getting physical evidence against her.
Well, they've kept me updated.
They're still looking for the gold Plymouth the shooter was in.
And Alice's DNA could be in that car, that would tie her to the murder.
Troopers have not made much progress.
Well, let's make it for them.
[Groans]
[Door opens]
[Sniffs] Hey.
Oh, hey.
You look like you could use this.
Oh.
You here all night?
Yes.
I have been just going over every scrap of information we have on Alice Sands just hoping to find something I missed.
But, uh, I texted you because of the accident investigation.
Did you look at Layla's notebook?
I did, and you were right.
The formulas that Layla calculated correspond almost exactly to the crash data.
So it wasn't an accident.
Well, I built a reconstruction scenario using the formulas that you found in Layla's notebook.
Mm-hmm.
There weren't skid marks because she was accelerating.
Well, there's no way to tell for certain.
Layla drove off that cliff and made it look like an accident.
She killed herself.
That's one theory, but none of this is conclusive.
And, Frankie, there's no way to truly know what was going on in Layla's mind.
[Music]
What if she never got to Route 16?
What if she took, like, this road here?
Well, the troopers searched these woods and this little lake. Nothing.
Where does this one go?
Looks like a dead end.
[Sighs] Okay.
[Music]
Yeah, it's just a dirt road. It just ends in these woods right here.
What is this? This isn't on the map.
Is that like... a crater or something?
It's covered in vegetation. It looks like an old quarry.
Did the troopers check it out?
It's not in the notes.
I'll get them to take a look.
There you are. I texted you.
I'm sorry.
I just needed some time to figure this out.
You talk to Maura?
Yeah, it looks like Layla crashed her car on purpose.
There's no definitive proof, but it might be a suicide.
There is proof. This is what I wanted to show you.
See the reflector there on the guardrail?
Yeah.
There shouldn't be any red reflectors along that stretch of road.
Department of Transit only uses yellow reflectors.
Layla put them there so she'd know exactly where to hit.
If the initial impact didn't kill her, the boulder at the bottom definitely would.
It's senseless. S-she was just a kid.
Hard to imagine things are so terrible this seems like the only way out.
Well, now I have to explain all this to her parents.
You can't explain... maybe no one can.
All you can do is tell them the truth.
You'll be fine.
[Music]
I can't.
Oh, yeah, yeah...
I... I'm sorry. Nina, don't...
Oh, God.
You got somebody watching the back?
Okay, let me know if she moves.
You got Sands under surveillance?
Mm-hmm.
She's not getting away this time.
Frankie, Mr. and Mrs. Jalbani are here.
They're downstairs.
Okay. Thanks.
Uh...
[Grunts] What's going on between you two?
Nothing.
It sure felt like something.
I'm just preoccupied.
I'm trying to figure out how much to tell Layla Jalbani's parents.
Do you know what happened?
Yeah.
The more I think about it, the more pissed off I get.
This bright, young girl killed herself instead of admitting that she's failing out of college.
Even worse... she makes it look like an accident so... her parents don't know that they're the reason she did it.
Okay, hold on. You can't just blame the parents.
Jane, they put a lot of pressure on her to succeed.
Frankie, it's never that simple.
[Elevator dings, doors open]
All right. All right, I appreciate it. Thank you.
Jane, they found it.
Wha... The Plymouth?
It was in the quarry.
Maine troopers found it under some trees.
We got to get it to Maura.
It's already handled. It's on the way to her.
Mr. and Mrs. Jalbani. We've completed the investigation.
And this mechanic... have you arrested him?
No, we didn't find any evidence that Layla's car had been tampered with.
W-Why was she even on that terrible road?
Please.
The truth is Layla was under a lot of stress.
Did you know that she was failing three classes at Pemberton?
Failing? Are you sure?
She never said anything.
Maybe she didn't want to disappoint you.
We could never be disappointed in Layla.
She was so much more than we could have ever imagined.
But failing would have been devastating for her.
You said that Layla was gonna be the first one in your family to graduate college.
Mm-hmm.
That she had a bright future.
Yes.
That must have meant a lot to you?
Yes, but, I mean, it meant everything to Layla.
You know, we said, "You come home. You go to the community college for one year, two years."
But Layla, she wouldn't hear of it.
She was determined to succeed.
That sounds like...
Layla put a lot of pressure on herself.
Always.
I don't understand.
Did this have anything to do with her crash?
Uh, not... not directly.
I guess it just might explain why she was distracted that night.
Actually, our... our investigation determined that this... was nothing more than a tragic accident.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
If there's anything else, please don't hesitate to call.
: What... print?
Partial. Probably not enough for an I.D., but it is on top of blood spatter from the trooper.
Well, so, that puts Alice in the vehicle when the trooper was shot.
Well, only if we could positively identify it as Alice's.
Maura.
Kent. Swab the seatbelt clasp and the glove-compartment handle for DNA.
Got it.
There's also a possibility on the trunk-release latch.
She torched the trunk.
Yeah, well, DNA is resistant to high temperatures.
You know, Alice left the police academy 20 years ago.
We've come a long way since then.
[Music]
All right, I'm gonna run these samples through the sequencer.
You're hovering.
Oh.
Wait, there's something here.
[Camera shutter clicks, computer beeps]
It's smeared, but...
Maura, we got to convince a judge, okay?
A partial ain't gonna cut it.
Well, not by themselves, maybe.
But if we can put them together...
Like a puzzle.
Exactly.
I just hope we have enough pieces.
[Computer beeps]
Was that a good beep or a bad beep?
[Beeping continues]
It's a match... to Alice Sands.
[Clacking, beeping continues]
You're sure?
We have a DNA match, too.
Alice Sands definitely touched that seatbelt.
The evidence places her in the car.
That'll tie her to the trooper's murder.
That's enough for any court.
We got her.
[Music]
: You two, around back.
[Whirring]
She's not here.
Are you sure she didn't leave?
We were covering the front and the back.
She didn't get past us.
No!
[Lock engages, gun cocks]
Drop the gun!
Don't shoot!
Alice, let him go.
Do it!
Let him go.
Do it!
[Whimpering]
Alice, let him go.
[Banging on door, doorknob rattling]
Please.
Jane? Knock it down.
[Banging on door] Tell them to stay out or I'll kill the kid right now.
You don't want to do that.
You want to watch him bleed out on the floor?
No, please!
Do it!
Korsak, back off! She's got a hostage.
There. Okay, see?
It's just you and me, all right?
Look, l-let's just put our guns down, okay?
Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
So you could put a bullet through my head.
No. No, I wouldn't. No, I don't want to do that.
Bullshit! You are such a liar.
You want me dead.
Alice, I don't want that.
You're so smug. You always were.
Listen to me, okay?
You let him go.
All right? I will stay.
Okay, come on, he's got nothing to do with this.
[Scoffs] Jane Rizzoli... always trying to be the hero.
I'm just doing my job! That's all I know how to do, okay?
[Siren wails]
[Whimpers]
Alice, please.
Okay, we can still walk out of here.
It's over.
[Wailing continues]
Maybe, but I'll still win.
Because after you kill me, everyone will think you're a dirty cop.
"Did Jane Rizzoli really kill that poor woman in cold blood?"
I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'm not gonna shoot you.
I'm not gonna give you the choice.
No!
[Gunshots]
[Thud]
[High-pitched ringing]
[Bang]
Jane?
Jane, you okay?
You're good.
Yeah...
It's okay. You okay?
Yeah.
You good?
Yeah.
This stool taken?
Why? You want to throw it at me?
I want to apologize.
No, I'm the one who should be apologizing.
I completely misread things, probably screwed up our friendship.
Frankie, stop.
I freaked out a little. That's all.
See, I hate that I put you in that position.
Since Marcus died, I've been on my own.
That was my first kiss.
I should have known that. Aw, I'm such an idiot.
No, I'm sorry.
Don't worry. It will never happen again.
I didn't say that.
[Music]
Wow.
[Both chuckle]
That happened.
[Clears throat] Um...
Well, I... I think I should buy you a drink.
I think you better, after that.
Yeah.
[Clears throat]
[Music]
Okay.
That's all of it.
Much better.
Now it feels like a real home.
Yeah.
Maybe we could move this and give you some more room.
What's in it?
No idea.
Ooh, interesting.
What?
It's a torture device.
You want me to show you how it works?
No!
I want you to shut that thing immediately.
What? This is fascinating.
These are actual medieval torture devices.
Well, now I understand why you and the Professor were friends.
What is that?!
A tongue tearer.
Okay, well, that seems completely necessary. [Chuckles]
[Grunts]
Medieval birth control.
Just don't go out, and then you don't need birth control!
Or you can call Martinez.
No.
[Clang]
You really think so?
Definitely.
Okay, I'll call Martinez if you ask Kent out.
Wha... Kent?
Yes, Kent!
It's so obvious there's totally something going on.
Maura!
That's ridiculous.
It is n...
We work together.
You're gonna need that.
Yeah, he does talk a lot.
[Music]
[Blows]
[Door opens]
Jane. I saw the news.
I'm glad you're okay.
Thank you.
I have time, if you needed the confessional.
Actually, I don't.
I mean, not... not today, anyway. I just...
I just came by to pay my respects.
"But I say to you, 'Love your enemies and pray for those that persecute you.'"
Matthew? [Chuckles]
