Are you ready to move to get the codes?
: Yes. I am.
You know it's possible for people like us who give everything to our country and the world to forget ourselves.
(voice breaking) I'm gonna miss her.
Before we take the last step, I'll ask them to look for another way in.
Do you want me to ask?
Yes.
None of my business anymore, but I can't stop thinking about you and Burov.
It might be that you're holding off with Burov because your conscience is bothering you, because of what happened to Nina.
What happened to your old boss?
He's going on a long trip to Thailand.
Frank Gaad. We have a proposal for you.
(grunts)
I'd like to sit down with you and Elizabeth and Paige when I get back from Ethiopia.
Tim is missing.
I made a tape.
It says exactly who you are.
If you have anything to do with this...
Paige, they're okay.
I've never been scared like that before.
Please tell your parents I'm sorry.
(doorbell rings)
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, am I interrupting anything?
No, no. Come on in, please.
It's so good to have you home safe.
Oh, thanks.
Can I get you something?
No, uh, I'm fine.
Pastor Tim. Welcome back.
Uh, you want coffee?
Uh, no, thank you.
Paige isn't here right now. Um...
Actually, I came to see you.
Is Henry...
Uh, H-Henry's upstairs in his room.
I don't feel right about what happened.
That you felt threatened for your safety because of something that happened to me.
It's okay.
Alice was so afraid, and... her reaction was understandable.
You're being generous.
When I got lost through my own stupidity...
I was terrified that no one would ever find me.
That I'd never see Alice again, see my baby born, grow up.
I thought about you two and Paige.
All the things that being a parent can mean.
Anyway... sorry for what happened.
Well, that's it.
That's what I came to say.
Pastor Tim...
W-Would you and Alice like to come to dinner sometime later this week or whenever is good for you?
P-Paige would love that, and so would we.
That... That sounds great.
I'll check with Alice, if that's all right.
Sure.
Great.
Great.
(door opens, closes)
: In here.
I made pierogi.
Missing the 'old country'?
(chuckles)
My mother used to make them for breakfast just like this.
When we had eggs.
No, thanks.
The Centre turned down your request.
The mission with Don and Young-Hee has to go forward.
(door opens)
: Okay, come on. Come on, everybody.
All right, Don, we're leaving.
(indistinct conversations)
(car door closes)
(engine starts)
(doorbell rings)
Patty.
Where's Young-Hee?
She's... She took the kids to school.
Is anyone else here?
No.
Uh...
Something... Something wrong?
(sighs)
I'm pregnant.
(scoffs)
Well, say something.
Uh, h-how did this happen?
It happened because we had s*x.
(voice breaking) I don't know what I'm gonna do.
(crying)
What am I gonna do?
You cannot have this baby.
What do you mean? I mean, what are you saying?
That would destroy everything.
For you.
(chuckles)
And Young-Hee.
So, you want me to get rid of it?
It's the only way.
I-I will pay for everything.
I don't want your money.
I don't want anything from you.
Don't worry, I won't upset your perfect little life, okay?
I'll take care of it myself.
(door opens, closes)
Thanks.
Yeah.
So, uh, what's going on?
(sighs)
You remember my old boss, Frank Gaad?
You met him a couple years ago. We had a barbecue.
He and his wife went on a trip to Asia... Thailand.
He was killed there.
He wa... He was killed?
What... What happened?
They say it was a robbery in his hotel room.
But I don't buy it.
I think the Soviets did it.
KGB.
I don't know why exactly.
He was out of the game.
He couldn't do anything to them anymore, but they...
They're animals.
You have no idea.
I could tell you stories.
I mean... Well, I can't tell you.
They're classified, but trust me, they do things you cannot imagine.
(door opens)
Oh, hey. What's up?
Hey.
Just, uh, chatting up my friend.
You know, I'm gonna head upstairs.
It's been a long day.
No, no.
I'm headed out, so...
It's good to see you.
Yeah.
Thanks for the drink.
Yeah, of course.
See ya.
: Good night.
Bye.
How'd it go? You all right?
I don't know.
It's all yours now.
(sighs)
(door opens)
Hey.
Hi.
Did Stan drop off any movies?
Nope.
Ugh. Damn. What's for dinner?
(chuckles)
Grilled cheese sandwiches.
Excellent.
Hey, be back down in 15 minutes, please.
Hands washed.
Okay.
How did, uh... How did youth group go?
(sighs) We made a schedule for the downtown food pantry.
I'm gonna be working there a couple nights a week.
Good.
Great.
Wheat or white?
White.
Wheat for me.
Stan's old boss, Frank Gaad, was killed in Thailand.
How?
He was murdered in his hotel room.
Stan told me Gaad was going to Thailand with his wife.
When did he tell you that?
A while ago. We were playing racquetball.
I put that in my report.
Hmm.
♪ Let's go down, come on down ♪

♪ Oh, sisters, let's go down ♪

♪ Down to the river to pray ♪
Hi.
I'm just here picking up Paige from choir practice.
I'm early, or they're running late.
Well, uh, come in. Come in.
We're so excited to have you over for dinner, you and Alice.
We're looking forward to it.
We got some strawberry ice cream for dessert.
Paige had mentioned that that was Alice's favorite?
It is. (chuckles)
Good.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
It's all right.
I think, you know...
I think maybe Philip and I have just been under a lot of pressure.
(sighs)
It's difficult.
Well, it's just... It's very hard.
Um...
You know, you are safe here, Elizabeth.
You can talk to me.
I think when Alice thought that we may have something to do with your disappearance...
Which is not her fault.
She was afraid, and I understand that.
I just really felt like I was... coming apart.
I understand.
Do you?
I think so.
(footsteps approaching)
(knock at door)
Sorry. Should I come back?
I didn't mean to take up your time.
No.
(chuckles)
(Airplane passes overhead)
You don't look so good.
I'm tired.
Not sleeping a lot.
I keep thinking...
You know what I keep thinking about?
You.
I'm flattered.
You're a smart guy, Oleg.
I don't think you'd be too surprised to hear there's been a lot of interest in you in our meetings.
There's been talk about blackmailing you.
Talk about using Nina... or your brother.
They want me to.
You know, when I started in counterintelligence, they gave me a new partner... Chris Amador.
You'd like the guy.
Funny.
Kind of direct, you know?
Irreverent.
I didn't even realize how close I was getting to the guy until you guys killed him.
Anyone tell you about that?
I didn't know what to do.
I think I kind of lost my mind.
I did something... terrible.
Just as bad.
I haven't felt the same since.
What do you want me to say?
Right.
What can you say?
Amador, Nina.
My old boss got killed.
I think you guys might've done it.
Somewhere in there, my wife left me.
I don't want you on my conscience, too.
This is the last time we're gonna see each other.
That's what I wanted to say.
(engine starts)
(vehicle departs)
(jazz music plays)
Red or white?
Red.
Red for me, too.
(chuckles)
Do you always cook dinner?
I try to.
I mean, everyone's busy.
Things don't always go according to plan.
I hope you like lamb.
Oh, I devour anything put in front of me these days.
I'm sure.
Elizabeth.
I didn't ask for this... any of this.
I'm not vindictive. I don't threaten people.
That isn't me. It's not who I am.
If I were in your situation, I probably would've done the same.
(doorbell rings)
Henry, can you get that, please?
Coming.
Coming.
Hey.
Hey.
Something smells good.
Yeah, Mom made lamb roast.
Who is it?
Stan.
: Oh, you got company?
Uh, yeah.
Hey. What's up?
Hey, I'm just dropping off 
Cool.
It's a good one.
Hey, why don't you stay for dinner?
We've got plenty, and you can meet Pastor Tim.
Mom, Stan's staying for dinner.
Stan?
Yeah.
He's starving.
I'll pull up a chair next to me.
Hey, look, if it's a problem I...
No, no, no. There's plenty to go around.
You sure?
Come on in.
You got a pastor in the house, huh?
Wow.
: Uh, hi, Stan.
Hi. I didn't know you had company.
Hi. I'm Tim.
Stan Beeman.
Pleased to meet you.
Likewise.
Alice.
Hi.
Tim is Paige's pastor. Our pastor.
He baptized me.
Wow.
Alice is my wife.
Oh, well, I see Elizabeth's not the only one with a roast in the oven.
(laughter)
I live across the street.
I-I tend to show up around meal time.
(chuckles)
Although I've never crashed a party before.
The more the merrier.
Yeah, look, come on. Pull up a chair.
Stuff your face.
You sure?
Absolutely. There's plenty to go around.
Okay.
Yeah, we moved here about three years ago.
It's a great little neighborhood.
From where?
St. Louis.
Mm.
Is your family out of town?
Oh, no, my son's with my wife.
And she's with her boyfriend.
We're getting divorced.
Mm. That must be hard.
It's getting better.
Well, not better.
Easier.
Uh, so, what do you do, Stan?
Oh, he's an FBI agent.
Really?
Really.
Huh.
And you're a pastor at the church Paige goes to?
I am.
I know it's been great for her.
We believe in social action and making the world a better place.
All for that.
Yeah, Pastor Tim chained himself to a fence once.
It... It was a Ban the Bomb rally.
Oh.
We believe in social justice with a healthy dollop of Jesus in the mix.
Can I help you?
Yeah, we're here to see Don Seong.
Is he expecting you?
No, but he'll want to see us.
Can I see some identification?
Of course.
(coughing)
Yes. I have a John, Leonard, and Theresa Rawlings here to see you.
Yes.
Have a seat. He'll be right out.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
(coughs)
How can I help you?
We're Patty's family.
We need to talk to you.
They're with me.
Okay. Here you go.
Pass here.
Follow me.
I'm, uh, I'm Patty's brother.
This is her father and stepmother.
Why did you come here?
Patty's dead.
Uh...
That cannot be true. I-I don't understand.
She killed herself.
She...
She was...
You knew that she was pregnant.
Y-Yes.
You told her to get an abortion.
Yes, but I-I had never thought that she would hurt herself.
You killed her.
You killed my beautiful girl, you b*st*rd.
I-I swear I did not know about that.
I'm... I'm sorry.
You're... You're sorry?
What? What... What does that even me...
My sister is dead!
I... P-Please, do... do not talk that loud.
N-Not in here.
You're a coward.
(coughs)
We want to take her home.
We expect you to pay.
For getting Patty to California and the funeral expenses.
Yes. Uh, I... will do that, of course.
We... We want the money now.
I-I do not have so much with me. Uh...
We... We can go to the bank, and I will get that money out.
Good.
Because you disgust me, and I never want to see your face again.
He's weak, John.
All right, okay. Um, you... you two stay here.
I'm... I'm sorry, but I cannot let them do that.
Look at him.
Okay.
(computer beeps)
(computer whirring)
(keyboard clacking)
Oh, hey.
Hi.
Uh, thanks for dinner the other night. It was really nice.
Yeah. It was nice to have you.
Um, interesting to meet your neighbor.
(chuckles)
Stan. Yes.
Yeah, I was surprised to hear about his profession.
Right.
Well, can't choose your neighbors.
Can't you?
We lived there first for a long time.
And you know... we didn't choose each other either, did we?
Honestly, I... can only thank you for everything you've done for Paige.
When she first started coming here to church, I felt threatened.
I was...
I was afraid I was gonna lose her.
To God?
And to you.
But it didn't happen.
In fact, we've gotten closer, and things have been better.
And there's nothing that I did or Philip.
It was you.
Oh.
You took a risk.
You opened yourself up to her.
That took faith.
In Paige.
Okay. (chuckles)
Yeah, I... feel...
What?
Mm.
That you're out on a limb and you've handed me a saw.
(chuckles)
None of us are in control.
Not really.
Not ever.
Because we're in God's hands?
I know you don't see it that way, but there is something greater than this.
Hmm.
How do you know?
I don't know.
I believe.
That doesn't always work, but most of the time... it makes things better.
(door opens)
You okay, Dad?
Let's get him home.
Sure.
I know nobody can forgive what I did.
I'm ashamed and... very sorry.
(door closes)
Hey, Stan.
One of the reports I put in for follow up on the Martha investigation came back with a curious detail.
"Curious" is a curious word.
"When the door became stuck while attempting to remove some files, Agent Gaad pulled repeatedly."
More like Gaad went batshit on the mail robot.
Martha covered for him.
While it was being repaired, there was a 911 call from the repair facility.
Apparently, there was a death there.
Who?
The owner's mother.
Now, the report says natural causes.
He went for it.
How is he?
Scared, upset.
We, uh... we didn't find the Level Four codes in his office.
But... they copied all of his computer discs, so hopefully they're there.
You think he'll tell Young-Hee?
I don't think so.
But it's hard to really know.
(dialing)
(telephone rings)
: Hello?
This is Mrs. Hathaway.
Oh, hi.
I have a message for you.
(siren wailing in distance)
: Patty, it's me.
I need to talk to you.
Where did you go?
Why you don't call me?
Something is not right about Don.
He's acting so...
I need to talk to you.
Please call b...
(coin clatters)
(dog barks in distance)
(indistinct conversations)
Hi.
Elizabeth.
I thought we were driving Paige home in the van.
Yeah, it's not far from work for me, and I was on my way home, so...
Oh.
Well, maybe you can come by a bit earlier and help out a bit next time.
Maybe.
(chuckles)
I'll let her know you're here.
Okay.
Pastor Tim.
Um... you know, if...
If you have something on your mind and... you know, you can't stop thinking about it... you want to, but you... you can't.
Um...
I pray.
For guidance.
What if you... what if you don't... believe in God?
Or religion or prayer?
None of those things matter.
It doesn't matter?
All that matters is how we treat each other.
Is this forever?
With Pastor Tim and Alice?
I don't know yet.
You know, Alice accused us of something that we didn't do, so that works to our advantage.
How?
Well, she feels bad.
Pastor Tim feels the same.
You understand?
You
 to forgive them.
Your father and I love you and will do anything to keep this family together.
And maybe a difficult situation will get easier for all of us, including Pastor Tim and Alice.
What about the tape?
I don't know.
But if it makes them feel good knowing it's sitting in a safe somewhere, maybe it's not such a bad thing.
Mom...
Matthew told me something last week, and I don't know if it's...
What?
Well, he said his dad's talking to him more, and he told him that he went out with the father of one of the secretaries in his office.
The secretary was a spy.
She just disappeared.
I guess it was really hard for Mr. Beeman to talk to her father.
I-I just went over there looking for Henry, and he... he started telling me this stuff.
Can I drive? I need more practice.
That's Dad's job.
It was worth a shot.
Got a cigarette?
No, we don't.
There's, uh... there's a grocery store down there.
(laughs)
Hey, uh, guys, we don't want any trouble.
Why don't you just, uh, go ahead and take that.
(chuckles)
How old are you?
Don't be scared, sweetheart.
(grunts)
(switchblade opens)
No!
(groaning)
(whimpers)
Paige!
(coughing)
Paige.
(coughing)
Let's go.
Paige, now!
