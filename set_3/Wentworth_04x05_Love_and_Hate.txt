Will Jackson did this to you, didn't he?
sh1t!
Mr. Jackson would never lay a finger on her. She's playing you.
You can't be seen defending a screw. You know there's nothing worse than that.
I got your results this morning.
The tests indicate some malignant cells.
There's gonna be an attack on Mr. Jackson.
What?!
Payback for the Ferguson thing... now!
Hey!
Mr. Jackson?! If you're in the kitchen 
Ah!
No, there won't be any action against you.
But you... you have to slot me, yeah?
You have to!
No. I just came to say "thank you".
Mr. Jackson?
Ugh!
Oh! Oof!

Maxine...
I'm gonna go.
Now, the good news is there's a high proportion of oestrogen receptive cells among the malignant ones.
Okay, what does that mean?
Well, there's a better chance that the cancer will respond to hormone therapy.
But I'm already on hormone therapy.
We need to starve the tumour of the oestrogen it needs to grow.
I can't stop taking oestrogen.
Actually there is an alternative, but it does come with higher risks.
Now, the oncologist, Dr. Hughes, is running a clinical trial on a new drug that's targeting hormone positive cancers... if we can move you to his hospital's secure ward, he may be able to pull a few strings.
Now, you'd have to start today.
Yes... yes, please.

Self-pity disgusts me.
You're a tough nut, Karen.
Do you know even when you were a kid you had a... hardness about ya?
Did I?
You're so full of sh1t. What are you doin' here?
Your father.
When?
Three days ago.
Emphysema, it turned into pneumonia and... he fought the good fight.
But you know, pack and a half a day of smokes for 40 years, it's hardly surprising.
So, you got... nothin' to say about that?
Any deathbed confessions?
Oh, Karen!
Are you still holdin' onto that? He's dead, it's over.
It's over?!
Look, the funeral's on Tuesday, if it's possible you should try and be there...
Why the f*ck would I go to his funeral?
Language, Proctor.
Because you owe me.
I owe you?
Yes, you owe me.
I sacrificed everything to keep our family together.
I wish I'd been there to see him die, to watch him drown in his own spit!
I said keep it down, Proctor.

Ah, Will Jackson, he's, ah... of course my deputy. He interviewed you. I'll get him to give you the tour.
Great. Thanks.
So, is it true the previous governor's been moved out of protection?
Where did you hear that?
Walford.
Yes, it is true.
Did you have any experience with our women while they were housed at Walford?
Nah, I've only worked with men.
Before Walford, I did a two year stretch at Long Bay.
Mm! Stretch? You make it sound like a prison sentence.
We're all "lifers".
(chuckles)
(chuckles)
Ah, Mr. Jackson. Ah you know Jake Stewart, of course.
Yeah. Good to see you again.
Hey, mate.
Thanks for the gig.
Pleasure.
I thought you could give him the tour.
Sure. Um... let's go.
All right.
Ah, Kaz Proctor's had a death in the family, her father... could be a grief counselling issue.
I'll alert Miss Westfall.
: Okay.
Great chatting.
: Thanks.
Hey.
Hi.
(Bea sighs)
Can I have a private word with my peer worker, please?
(Bea sighs)
So... what was that all about?
You attacking Mr. Jackson like that?
I did what I had to do.
Don't worry about it.
What's Ferguson up to?
Nothin'.
Screws are keepin' a close eye on her, but she's still bein' protected by Kaz.
: Kaz been stirrin' up sh1t since I've been in here?
I dunno... I've had my own stuff to deal with.
Yeah, like what?
My conjugal.
It's finally been approved.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Well, that's a good thing isn't it?
Well, we've only done it once, up against a wall.
And Nash has never seen me naked.
Well, he's in for a treat then isn't he?
And I've had a baby since then.
Dor... once he buries his face in these babies, he's not gonna worry about anything else.

It's not the f*ckin' Olympics.
What's goin' on there?
I dunno.
Game's over.
: What? No, it's not.
No it's not f*ckin' over 'cause we're winnin'!
We were winning, Tina.
So, in here is the yard for H-block, where we house some of our highest profile prisoners, including Bea Smith.
Who's currently in the slot, following an attack.
(door beeps and unlocks)
Well, who'd she attack?
Me.
(Stewart chuckles)
Oh, that's, uh... (chuckles) sh1t.
Hey, which one's the ex-Governor?
(exhales) Huh, is it true she actually petitioned to get into general?
Mm-hmmm.
So, why hasn't she been ripped apart?
We had her under 24 hour guard.
We still keep a close eye on her, but she's with Kaz Proctor's crew now, Red Right Hand, they protect her.
She can't be that terrifying if she needs protection.
She knows the system better than anyone... which makes her the most dangerous prisoner in here.
: 
: 
: Hey, check out the hottie!
Hey, hottie! How's it goin'?
(prisoners cheering)
Yee-ow!
: He's mine, bitches!
Yeah, good morning to you too, ladies.
Mr. Jackson's got a friend now, hadn't he?
Yeah.
Isn't it good to see the women loosening up a bit while Bea Smith's in the s...
: Hey... got a message from Bea.
Mm-hmm.
Keep an eye on Ferguson and Kaz in case they try somethin'.
What?
While Bea's in the slot, you're Top Dog, right?
She wants me to spread the word. Nothing happens without your say so.
Doreen, I...
I can't be Top Dog.
: Hey. What's goin' on?
But you're Bea's 2IC?
Honey, I can't.
Oh, no, come on, Maxie. I-I can... I can help you, if you want.
Bea thinks Kaz or Ferguson might make a move. You've gotta hold the fort for her.
She'll just have to find someone else.
There is no one else.
I reckon there's somethin' goin' down with that Asian crew, 'cause my radar is pingin' like crazy.
Tina and Kim are cookin' somethin' up for sure.
Hey, I saw Kim meetin' some bloke in the visitors...
Yeah?
Yeah. Gave him a big pash too.
Oh.
Ho-ho, no way?!
Bea'll go ballistic if this place is flushed with gear when she gets out.
You are gonna have to do something, love.

No, here I'll do it!

Mm.
(inhales) S... is there something you?
Ah, just, ah, I don't mean to sound forward, but I'd like to make some time to, ah, discuss some things with you.
Some things?
Ideas. Certain strategies I picked up at Walford, and developed, that I think could be implemented here.
Ooh, well, I am always open to, er, new ideas, a fresh perspective, if you make a time with my assistant.
Like now, for instance.
Well, I don't have time right now.
No, I don't right mean now, I mean right now. You've got your Top Dog in the slot.
Yes, that's right.
Well, at Walford, when King sh1t was in the hole... um, sorry, excuse my... when the prisoner in charge was in solitary, it was like Christmas in general.
And I used to say, "When it's Christmas in general... that's the time to play Grinch."

Take your hand away.

I said, take her hand out of the steam press.
What about the rules?

(Tasha gasps)
(Tasha gulps and gasps)
I know she broke a rule, okay. The most important rule we have...
But while Bea's in the slot, I'm Top Dog.
And if any punishment's to be dealt out, it's up to me what course it takes, and I'm letting Tasha off with a warning.
(Tasha crying)

Does anyone here have a problem with that?
No.
