[music]
[grunting]
What the f*ck do you want?
[gasps]
[clicking]
Not really.
I'm starting to wonder if I should be more afraid of getting them back.
I don't deserve to be their mother.
Maybe I don't deserve anything more than exactly what I got.
I'm gonna give you a free pass.
Nothing you say now will affect my custody recommendation.
Why would you do that?
Because believe it or not, I'm trying to help you... and I can't without the truth.
I put her in danger again.
What happened?
They came for me.
Who came for you, Carrie?
You want the truth?
I'm a liar.
I lied to my family. I lied to my husband.
Gordon, he never lied.
And his truth is the only one I have left.
He dedicated his whole life to fighting corruption in this town.
And you feel you have to see it through because he died saving you.
It's not so simple.
Then help me.
Help me out with it. Help me understand, Carrie.
What's the truth? Carrie, help me...
That I never stopped loving somebody else!
I know, I have to stop this fighting.
No.
You have to finish what you started.
[music]
What kind of shrink are you?
This is the father in me.
And I know that until you make peace with this, you can't be the parent that your children need.
So go finish it.
[music]
[man wheezing, coughing]
Where's my drugs?
They took everything.
Who did?
[groans]
You let Calvin Bunker take my drugs? Huh?
You let Bunker take my drugs? [grunting]
You disappeared on me this morning.
But anyway, I tracked down our statutory rape victim.
She said all the right things, but my bullshit meter is ringing.
Anyway, I'm going back to the hotel, so call me and I can fill you in on the...
: Okay, hotel surveillance shows Dawson
leaving the property a little before noon yesterday.
I've got every available deputy out searching for her.
FBI is mobilizing a task force.
She won't live that long. We have to find her now.
Hood, I have been hunting for this son of a bitch for months and all I got is dead ends. [sighs]
What about the girl? The one that burned herself.
We searched her apartment three times.
We can't find a single connection to Bode.
I did request an expedited subpoena for her cell phone records, but that's still gonna take a few days.
You still got the phone?
Well, yeah, I mean, what's left of it.
Let's go.
[sighs]
I've seen that look before.
[sighs] I need your help.
Some things never change, do they?
Just like old times.
Well, you're the expert on old.
Wait a minute. I know you.
Excuse me?
You and I were in a gunfight together with the Ukrainian gangsters at the metalworks.
Correction, I was in a gunfight.
You were lying on the floor crying about your motherfucking leg.
What's in the bag?
Cell phone. I need the call history.
Last few days.
Look, I'm afraid there's not much to work with there...
Maybe for your police techs.
This got something to do with the Bowman girl?
Yeah.
Give me 15 minutes. Sugar, where's my computer?
Exactly where you left it.
Well, it ain't gonna fetch itself.
[breathing heavily]
[music]
f*ck!
[panting]
[rattling]
[groans]
[computer chirps]
I'm in.
The heat scrambled most of the internal memory, but there was still enough raw data for me to recover the ESN and hack the log.
[chuckles] I have no idea what you're saying, but I sure as hell missed hearing you say it.
What time did that girl set herself on fire?
7:00 A.M.
She make any calls that morning?
Five in the two hours before she grilled herself.
All to the same number.
Bode.
Give me the number. I'll have my people do a trace.
I already traced it. You best keep up, cop.
Belongs to a Kim Newton. You know her?
No, but I'm guessing she's connected to Bode.
Address.
Thanks.
[music]
Who the f*ck let you in here?
I'm looking for Calvin.
You must also be looking to get your ass kicked.
Mr. Bunker took something that didn't belong to him.
My employer would like it back.
Yeah? Well, you can tell Proctor
We're putting him out of business.
Oh.
I see.
: You, you!
[men shouting]
[blows landing]
[men screaming]
[squelching]
[screaming stops]
[body thuds]
[breathing heavily]
You're an FBI agent.
Yeah. And you're a serial killer.
I don't kill them because I like to, you know.
You kill them because you're insane.
It's all relative, right?
Not really, no. You think Satan speaks to you.
There is no Satan. Ergo, you're insane.
You're not afraid of me, are you?
Oh, don't take it personally.
I've just seen behind the curtain one too many times.
The curtain?
Yeah, you know, like "The Wizard of Oz."
Turns out the big powerful wizard is just smoke and mirrors, a delusional old fart with a few magic tricks.
You know what I think?
I think you've taken down enough wizards to wonder if maybe they know something that you don't.
And those truths have f*cked you up so badly that you don't even know when to be afraid.
Makes you feel impotent, less powerful.
[whispers] You can't profile me.
I don't have to.
I already caught you.
I like you, Veronica.
But you're still gonna cut my heart out.
Yes, I am.
See what I mean?
f*cking insane.
What's wrong?
I just got a call about a handful of Calvin's guys dead at the clubhouse.
Do you think Calvin did it?
No, they're his guys.
But I think the Brotherhood is going to war.
And I don't want to have to worry about you while I'm dealing with Calvin.
You're not safe here at Brock's house anymore.
I spoke to a friend in Dade County. He's a retired cop.
He's got a place in Turnberry Isle.
You and Hank will be safe there for the time being.
It won't be for long.
You don't get it.
No matter where we run, as long as Calvin's breathing, he's not gonna let me go.
Yeah, it's me.
I'm talking to your f*cking voicemail again.
This is your last chance, Maggie.
Tell me where the f*ck you are or I swear to God I will destroy...
[sighs]
[humming]
Call me back.
[water running]
Oh, sh1t.
You really think I'll let this stand?
You stupid bitch. This will not f*cking stand.
I will f*cking end you. I will rip your f*cking lungs out and I will strangle you with them.
Calvin?
Hello, Martin.
What the hell are you doing?
Jesus Christ.
[grunts]
Stupid gook m*therf*cker!
[grunting]
[screams]
[panting]
[spits]
[music playing]
: Oh, my God.
[distant siren wailing]
Senator Mitchum, thank you for seeing me.
I figure if it wasn't important, you would have just called me.
So what is it?
We had some complications.
We can't afford any complications, not with these people.
Or we both wake up strangled by our own tongues.
I know that. That's why I'm here.
You're having production problems?
No, production is on schedule.
I'm having... personnel issues.
[knocks]
[sighs] Sheriff's Department!
Hello!
Check around back?
It's open.
We having company?
: Later.
I'm not really dressed for it.
And I could use a drink if you're pouring.
What would you like?
Whiskey, please.
[scoffs] You're really gonna make me drink my last drink through a straw?
We both know if I untie you, you'll try to run.
Then I'll have to rough you up again to get you back on the table.
And what would the neighbors think?
Nothing. I'll check upstairs.
Okay.
So who's coming over?
Just some friends.
You have a ritual.
Yeah.
Upstairs is clear.
She was here.
Oh, sh1t. [sighs] Well, she's not here now.
I wonder if this place has a basement.
Satan didn't tell you to kill me. I just showed up.
I can't let you live.
Maybe I could just join you and worship with you and your buddies?
No.
Why not?
Because Satan doesn't exist, remember?
I'm pretty sure you said that.
Nothing more annoying than a psychopath who engages in Socratic debate.
Shh.
[music]
Now what?
You okay? What's wrong?
Hey.
[sighs]
You look beautiful.
Sorry, Kim. I'm not into girls.
My name is Lilith.
No, it's not.
You asked me how the s*x was when I met Declan.
It was transcendent.
It was rape.
No.
You were a child.
And he made me a woman.
[grunts]
Hey, her car.
What?
Her car is in there.
Give me a hand.
Yeah.
There's blood here.
sh1t.
Hey, Hood.
Diprivan. Brand name for Propofol.
Same sh1t that killed Michael Jackson.
What's it used for?
General anesthesia.
So what the f*ck is it doing in a garage?
Brock? Hey.
[music]
[grunts]
[alarm chirps]
[lock clicks]
[gasps, choking]
Killers, rapists, drug dealers... all walking the streets because of you.
No, it's Proctor. It's Proctor.
He threatened me. I swear to God, he threat...
You... are the goddamn district attorney.
[choking]
He... He threatened my family.
I have three kids. Please.
Please don't do this. [sobs]
[gasps]
I want to know about everything Proctor has his hands in.
I only know what he wants me to know.
Are you lying to me?
No.
No, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
Last week... last week he made my office seize all the tower records from the old municipal airport.
Why? Who's flying in?
Emilio Loera.
Loera?
He's a major player in the Colombian cartel.
Proctor's selling to the cartel?
I don't know. I swear to God, I don't know.
I'd tell you if I did.
[gasping]
Go home.
What?
You just quit.
Get your kids and get the hell out of Banshee.
[music]
[coughing]
[echoing] Hey, Hood.
The dizziness comes in waves.
[chains rattling]
[groans]
You got any give on your cuffs?
No.
Yeah, me neither.
What is this?
I don't know. Some sort of basement.
Of course.
Did you get a look at him?
He came to visit me the other night.
Who did?
Bode.
You saw him? Why the f*ck didn't you say anything?
I don't know. Maybe I was... spooked.
And when I came to, he had a knife to my throat.
He could have killed me right there, but he didn't.
Said he wanted me to bear witness.
To what?
I don't know.
But I'm guessing we're about to find out.
So Dawson probably showed up and got the same treatment.
She might still be here.
[grunting]
Hey, I applaud your effort, but you're not gonna break out of stainless steel cuffs, okay?
You don't break the cuffs. You work the links.
If you're lucky, there's a defect.
Why don't you try yours again?
All right.
Ah, f*ck.
My right hand is a little loose.
If I can just get a little more leverage.
They're solid. Stop it.
Hood. Hood. Stop!
[Lucas grunting]
We're not getting out of here.
You know what sucks about this?
I mean, besides the fact that we're gonna die.
I never got to be the sheriff I wanted to be.
I waited so long for this. I waited for one sheriff to die.
And then I had to wait for you to burn out, which you did in such a big way.
No offense.
None taken.
I mean, okay, so I'm not the most charming guy.
I rub some people the wrong way and, you know, I can't kiss ass.
It's just not in my nature, you know?
But I've never been afraid to stand up to anybody who threatened the well-being of my town.
I wanted to be that guy, you know?
The guy that made people feel safe.
And I haven't done that.
Hey. Can I ask you something?
Be the last time.
What?
Who the f*ck are you?
Look, I know you got a lot of secrets, Hood.
I'd be an idiot not to acknowledge that.
No, we're not gonna do that condemned men confess their sins sh1t, all right?
Yeah, I think that's exactly what we're gonna...
No, we're not.
Any minute now, that door is gonna open and something very bad is gonna walk through it.
Now, don't you want to meet this with a clean conscience?
No, shut the f*ck up.
Come on, Hood, please listen.
Then just answer the f*cking question for me!
No, I'm not gonna drop it!
I want to know! Why are you here? Why did you become a cop?
I am not a cop! I never was a f*cking cop!
What does that... what does that mean?
I'm not Lucas Hood!
I saw him die.
I picked up his wallet and I became him.
That's not even possible. I don't... What are you...
I'm a lie, Brock. I'm a fake.
I was a thief.
Not just a thief, I'm a f*cking infiltration specialist.
The places no one could get into, I got in.
I had a good run, but I got caught and I did 15 years.
No, no. You're f*cking with me.
Come on. You're an ex-con? No.
No.
Who else knows about it? Siobhan know?
In the end, yeah.
Why would you do that? Why?
Why would you come to this town and pretend to be a cop?
I don't know. I...
When I got out...
I had nothing.
[music]
Whoever I was before... was gone.
I was no one.
to the one person who... who really knew me.
Carrie Hopewell?
Ana.
She was all I had.
So when I got out, I tracked her down and I came for her.
But she had Gordon and the kids and a life.
Oh, my God.
But you're not. You weren't.
Well, I was getting up every day, putting on the uniform.
Eventually the... lie took over.
I believed it. I was... I was the sheriff.
I was a cop and I liked it.
I f*cking loved it.
Somehow it just...
[sighs] Somehow it just felt right.
There's nothing f*cking right about what you did.
It is the opposite of right.
I trusted you. I followed you.
I killed for you.
No.
No, you killed for you.
Not me. I just showed you the way.
A criminal. [laughs]
That's rich. I was deputy to a criminal.
Oh, God.
[laughing]
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
It all makes sense now.
All of it.
I'm so stupid.
[laughs]
If you're not Lucas Hood... what's your name?
[door opens]
Sheriff Lotus.
It's good to see you again.
And you.
Dr. Quick tells me you're friends with Agent Dawson.
That's right. And if you've hurt her in any way...
I'm gonna f*cking kill you.
You fellas are in for a treat tonight.
Yeah?
You gonna con another poor girl into burning herself to a crisp?
Gail was a true believer.
No, she was a confused and vulnerable young girl who you manipulated for your own sick pleasure.
[groans]
It looks like you're going to be my guests tonight.
Thing is, we have a dress code, so Dr. Quick is going to work his magic and make you look a little more like family.
[music]
You bust into my office.
You steal my camera.
I gotta say, I was hoping we would meet again.
Gather round, everybody. It's almost time to begin.
[music]
We have an unexpected offering tonight.
: Gloria Satanas.
: Satanas vobiscum.
Gloria Satanas.
Satanas vobiscum.
Gloria Satanas.
Don't worry, Sheriff. This won't hurt a bit.
Here we go. Gloria Satanas et Belial et Spiritui maloso.
: Sicut erat in principo, et nunc, et semper, et in saecula saeculorum.
: No, no. Stay the f*ck away from me.
Stay away! Stay the f*ck away from me!
us against trespass who those forgive we as
Hey, hey. You don't have to do this.
But I really want to.
[whimpering]
Hey!
You can't hurt me. He won't allow it.
Oh, yeah? Then he won't mind if I do this.
[Declan laughs]
[laughing]
What's so funny?
You have no idea how insignificant you really are.
That makes two of us, pal.
Declan!
[screams]
Hood!
[panting]
[gunshot]
[music]
Is that the man that killed my niece?
Yeah.
[music]
Thank you.
[beeping]
[distant siren wailing]
[computer beeps]
[beeps]
[music]
[beeping]
[gasps]
Job.
You remembered.
I have money, Job.
Lots of it.
You have no idea.
23.62 million.
Not counting the 5.2 million in Swiss francs
Or rather I should say "you had."
What did you do with my money? [chuckles]
Oh, honey, that ain't your money no more.
What do you want?
[sighs]
What do I want?
I want...
20 months of my motherfucking life back.
It wasn't personal.
But you're right. I f*cked you.
Imagine what you and I could do...
20 months!
20 months of planning all the things I was going to do when I got out.
All the things I was going to do... to the m*therf*cker who put me there.
[whimpers]
[breathing heavily]
But I have since seen the light.
[panting]
Erasing your worthless ass ain't gonna give me back the time you took.
You're not going to kill me?
No.
[beeps]
You wanted to f*ck with the best.
Well, now you are the best.
Now you are Job.
From now on, anytime anybody comes looking for me, they're gonna find you. Every security system I ever cracked, 
Mossad, People's Republic, Uncle Sam, and a who's who of unsavory terrorist types, they all got serious beef with you now.
Bitch, I just made your punk ass famous.
And something tells me... you gonna be a hell of a lot easier to find than I ever was.
Have a nice short life, m*therf*cker.
Job, wait.
You can't do this to me!
Job!
