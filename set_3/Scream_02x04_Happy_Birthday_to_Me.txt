What is this?
That's a pig farm.
: There's nothing in here. Am I completely crazy? Am I seeing things?
(SCREAMS)
: 
(GRUNTING, SCREAMING)
Dad, stop!
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
: 
Someone's out there.
Someone's what?
(SCREAMING)
(BIRDS TWEETING OUTSIDE)
(PHONE VIBRATING)
(GASPS)
(VIBRATING CONTINUES)
What the hell?
: 
(HANGS UP)
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

(PHONE DINGS)
(DOOR OPENING, CLOSING)
(FAINT ARGUING)
: I need to talk to Emma.
: No, no. I'm not listening.
I'm not letting you hurt her. She saw your rage firsthand last night.
Do you have any idea how upset she was?
(STAIR CREAKING)
Emma? Can I talk to you for five minutes?
I have... I'm late for school.
I can come after school.
Absolutely not! I have to be away tonight.
I don't want you alone with her.
I'm her father.
Emma, he's not allowed in this house when I'm away tonight.
Will you just stop, both of you?
You hit my mom. You're a bad dad.
That's who you are. And you...
You think you can protect me by hiding things from me, but it does the opposite thing!
Haven't you figured that out?
Would you just please stop making this about me?
Because it is actually about both of you!
(MAN SPEAKING ON TV)
Where have you been?
Out.
All night?
Gee, Dad, did I miss curfew?
Dude! Lakewood's a small town.
People watch.
They talk.
What did you think I was doing?
I don't know what you were doing, but I know you.
And I know you.
This town has been good to me. I like it here.
Don't ruin that for me.
Relax. I'm not trying to ruin anything.
Happy birthday, by the way.
Sure you don't want me to get your friends together?
We could do something really fun tonight.
I am doing something fun tonight.
With Emma.
Alone.
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
Morning, sweetheart. I brought up your coffee.
Thanks, Daddy.
Excited about tomorrow?
Oh, so that's why you're playing coffee servant?
Yeah, I'm ecstatic about tomorrow, actually. Who doesn't love a Friday?
They announce the Lady of the Lake Pageant finalists, and I have no doubt whatsoever that you... are going to be one of them.
Lucky me.
Your, uh, chances of winning decrease dramatically if Jake Fitzgerald is your escort.
Then, I should be a sure bet.
You two have a fight?
You can't fight with someone who's not speaking to you.
Besides, I think he fled to Mexico with his parents, not that I care.
I am sure you will have the pick of all the boys.
Choose wisely.
(DOOR OPENS)
(SIGHS)
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey.
Is that a job application?
Yep, Grindhouse is hiring.
Wouldn't completely suck working together, right?
No, yeah. That would... That would be awesome. (CHUCKLES)
Um, hey, why don't we do something fun for Kieran's birthday tonight?
Oh, uh, we're just doing, like, a little romantic thing, just the two of us.
Kieran didn't want a big party, so...
And you believed him?
You say that like I shouldn't have.
(SIGHS) It's Kieran.
He's never gonna ask you to throw him a big party, even if that is what he wants.
Wait, did he tell you that's what he wants?
Oh, my God. How did I...? (SIGHS)
Should I do something else?
I mean, you've still got time.
Yeah. I guess I just need to think bigger. But how big?
I don't know. A house, people, booze.
My mom is filling in for the medical examiner in Portsmouth tonight.
I could throw a surprise party at my house.
Great. Yeah. That just leaves the booze, which I can help you with... after school.
I'm 23 years old, by the way.
I've been told I look very young for my age.
Yes, you certainly do, Mr. Anthony Giordano.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(LAUGHS) Anthony's a pretty suave guy.
Yeah, and mysterious, too.
He likes to, uh, live life on the edge.
I just want to have some fun, so...
And that's why you have a fake ID?
Hmm, maybe I just like to be someone else every once in a while.
Yeah.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)
(PHONE VIBRATING)
So, both of you guys can come to Kieran's party tonight, right?
Right?
Oh, uh, yeah, sure.
Guest list is devised. Texts sent.
(PHONE DINGS, VIBRATES)
Look, another RSVP.
It's called Study Hall for a reason, ladies.
What do you guys think of that Stavo dude?
He seems kinda off.
: That is putting it mildly.
I think he's a total weirdo.
Plus, he has this whole fanboy thing with the Lakewood Six.
He's kind of obsessed with us, actually.
Where are you going?
Restroom. Be right back.
I gotta hand it to you, Em.
Having a party behind your mother's back?
(CHUCKLES) Who are you and what have you done with Emma Duval?
I don't know. I just felt like it was time for me to start being a normal teenager, I guess?
(ALARM BLARING)
Everyone, leave your belongings right where they are.
Proceed out the door, quickly.
Got a minute?
Need your help tracking down my daughter's ex-boyfriend, Jake Fitzgerald.
You need to fill out a missing person's report?
That's the thing.
Fitzgerald isn't missing as much as he is avoiding me.
With good reason, I assume.
I'd like a few words with him.
Quinn, this is a police station, not a dating service.
So, whatever this boy did to your daughter, I'm sure it can be rectified by passing her a note in Study Hall, so...
The kid screwed me over, then skipped town.
I need you to find him.
You think this is my job description?
I created your job description.
And because I'm your friend, I hired you to come back to Lakewood and play savior.
You're welcome, by the way. Now, I expect you to be my friend.
I'll let you know when I find him.
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
: 
Oh, hey! Wow! Fancy seeing you here!
At school.
Yeah.
You headed to AP English?
Yeah, in a sec. You?
Yeah, totally.
Hey, so, uh... keep this on the down low, but Emma's throwing this surprise party for Kieran's birthday tonight.
It is super secret, but I think I could swing bringing a guest.
Um...
Cool! You should totally do that.
Okay. Yeah, I will.
He'll pick you up at 6:30.
So, 7:00? Your place?
Uh, let's say 7:30.
Okay. Are you sure you still want to do something?
You're dealing with a lot.
We can chill, celebrate tomorrow.
It's your birthday. I want to chill and celebrate with you tonight.
Okay.
: 
Just like I said. Jake Fitzgerald has been out with strep throat since Monday.
And who called him in sick?
Jake did. Spoke to him myself.
He sounded just horrible. Normally, I would've confirmed it with his parents.
Yeah, I spoke with them this morning.
They were texting with Jake last night.
They didn't mention anything about him being sick.
His parents are in Mexico.
There's no way he's not calling in sick to school.
Right.
Thanks.
Okay, which one are you feeling? Bold or understated?
And remember, you're Zoe, not Audrey.
Dude, they're the same shirt.
Are you blind?
This one has thicker lines.
Keep looking.
Hey, you're friends with that Stavo guy, right? What's your take?
He seems cool. Big fan of The Morgue, which bodes well for his taste.
And he's a walking encyclopedia of horror comics.
You know, that pile on my desk is for you, by the way.
You know he draws us? The Lakewood Six?
I caught him staring at me in Study Hall.
Okay, how about this one?
I said keep looking.
It's a completely different shirt!
Brooke thinks he's obsessed with us. I think she's right.
(SCOFFS) Yeah, well, Brooke thinks everyone is obsessed with her.
And, you know, brooding loners always get a bad rap.
Jennifer Jason Leigh in 
 Markie Mark in 
Their obsessions always lead them right over the edge into crazy Stalkerville, but it doesn't mean that's what's happening here.
Honestly, I think you sound a little paranoid.
I just think you've seen too many movies.
That sounds like the virgin pot calling the bi-curious kettle black.
Cardigan or no cardigan?
Cardigan?
That's a good choice.
Jake Fitzgerald! It's Sheriff Acosta. I need to speak with you.
(CHOPPING)
Oh, I'm good.
Why? You didn't like the last one?
No, I did, too much. What did you put in that?
A little of this, a little of that.
I've been making that for my mom since I was, like, seven.
(LAUGHS)
Oh! Oh, you're serious.
Yeah.
Oh. (GIGGLES)
You want to give me a hand with this?
Sure.
Careful.
: 
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Hey!
Hey! Well, if it isn't Emma's co-conspirator.
Oh, so sweet of you, but you didn't have to bring anything.
Oh, I didn't. It was, um... It was on the porch.
Whoa. Whoever did knows their tequila. That's extra añejo.
Like, super aged, super expensive. It's, like, three hundred bucks a pop.
"A pricey birthday bottle from south of the border. Shots are on me. Jake."
That's one way to tell everyone you're back from Mexico.
He's such an attention whore. I need a drink.
Who's, uh... Who's bartending?
That would be me.
I actually left the cups in the car.
Will you go get them?
Uh, sure.
Okay, what was that?
Something almost happened with Eli, but I just want to have fun tonight.
I don't want it to be a thing.
(CHUCKLES) Details, now.
There are no details, really, because nothing actually happened.
That's not a thing. You wouldn't have brought it up to me if it was nothing.
It was something.
Yeah, you're right. It was.
It was something. Um...
We were hanging that banner and he fell, and then, he, like, grabbed me, and I think he wanted to kiss me.
(CHUCKLES) Did you want him to kiss you?
I'm... I'm with Kieran.
It's Kieran's birthday.
That's not answering my question, Emma.
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
You cannot be starting something with...
Hey, I couldn't find the cups.
I-I found them. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
Great. What can I make you?
(CLEARS THROAT) What's this?
Oh, it's mine. It's vodka and...
I'll take it.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER, DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh, hey! I didn't see you guys come in.
Oh, hey!
Hey!
Noah, where is your mystery date?
Oh! Oh, you guys are together!
(GASPS) Noah and Zoe!
Yeah! Of course. I mean, doesn't this shirt scream "date night"?
Drinks on drinks on drinks.
: Oh, wow. Thank you.
What's this?
It's a shot.
Obviously. Of what?
Tequila.
From that ridiculously expensive bottle in the kitchen.
Eli said we should all do one when Kieran walks in.
I guess Jake is good for something.
Yo! Kieran alert! Coming up the driveway!
Can I offer you a shot?
No.
Come on. It's a group thing.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
: Come in!
Surprise!
(ALL CHEERING)
Down the hatch.
: Happy birthday!
Drink it.
Are you surprised?
Yeah.
Definitely. This is... Yeah.
I was... I was going to do something small, just the two of us, but I changed my mind.
No, this is... this is great. Seriously.
Why did you change your mind?
Eli. He said you wanted something big.
Hey, let's go... let's go say hi to some people.
Why did you invite Stavo? I thought he creeped you out.
He does and I didn't. But I don't know.
Maybe he's harmless. I guess it is a party.
Hey, that tequila tasted weird, right?
And it smelled pretty bad, too.
Well, you know, God knows what it is.
It's coming from Jake.
Did you just say "Jake"?
(PEOPLE MOANING, VOMITING)
Hey, you okay?
I feel so sick.
Does tequila go bad?
I think we need to get everyone to the...
(VOMITS)
I still think we need to get everyone to the hospital, just to be safe.
: I haven't eaten a thing tonight.
My bet is, it's Jake's tequila.
Score one for the blonde.
Back in Phoenix, it was a thing to go to the desert and trip on Ayahuasca.
Did it myself once. It had the same pungent smell as that tequila.
Made you hurl, too. I think we might have been dosed.
Even Jake wouldn't do that.
Wouldn't he?
His behavior has been less than stellar, lately.
"Ayahuasca. Used as a spiritual medicine in ceremonies among the indigenous peoples of Amazonian Peru."
Yeah. So, if that's what it is, the puking should stop soon. It's fairly harmless.
"Individuals often feel they gain access to higher dimensions and make contact with spiritual guides."
What does that mean?
It means we start hallucinating.
Oh, my God.
Or not.
It affects everyone differently.
Some people feel wired.
Others get tired and pass out.
Me? I got super relaxed. No inhibitions.
It all depends on what's buried inside you.
It brings that truth to the surface.
You seem to know a lot about a drug that you only did one time.
Suspicion. Paranoia. Ayahuasca can do that, too.
Look, if we're all about to start hallucinating, we need to keep everyone inside this house.
We need to be safe.
Yes. I will go get everyone who is outside yakking in my front yard.
I can give you a hand.
No, no, no! I will give her a hand.
Come on.
You looked like you needed a hand.
Your eyes...
Are they always on fire?
Maybe you should lie down.
Yeah.
(VOICE DISTORTING) Seriously, dude? You think this is funny?
(VOICE DISTORTING) You're funny. Everything is pretty funny right now.
You lied to Emma. This is the kinda crap I was telling you about this morning.
Did you bring the Ayahuasca, too?
I don't even know who Jake is.
What are you guys talking about?
(NORMAL VOICE) Kieran thinks I'm a liar.
You are a liar.
Why did you tell me he wanted some huge birthday party?
Were you just trying to make me look like an idiot?
No! No, I would never do that.
Whoa, hey! Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Let's get him to a bed.
I'm fine.
: 
I don't like this.
You okay?
Make it stop. Please make it stop.
You're gonna be okay. Just let me guide you through this, all right?
Focus on my voice. Tune everything else out.
: 
(VOICE DISTORTING) You okay?
No, I don't think so.
You really think he wants to help you?
Seriously? He just wants in your pants.
(LAUGHS)
Make it stop.
(TEETH CRUNCHING)
Please make it stop.
You want to have s*x with him, but you can't.
'Cause you're still in love with me.
Shut up!
I'm just saying what you're thinking, babe.
Don't you get it? You already know.
You're not over me.
Leave me alone!
(LAUGHING)
Guys... seriously...
I've got it from here.
Okay.
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)
I know he's your cousin, but, seriously, what is up with that guy?
Always takes it too far.
When we were kids, he borrowed a neighbor's dog.
Borrowed, as in stole?
Everybody was looking for it.
Couldn't find it. Ended up dead.
Dead?
You mean, by accident...
Right?
(ECHO) 
(PIG SQUEALING, FAINT)
(SQUEALING GROWS LOUDER)
Hey, have you seen Emma?
I think she's in her bedroom.
Alone or with someone?
(LAUGHING) I don't know.
(WHISPERING VOICES)
What have you done?
No, no. I'm sorry.
It's my fault. I admit it. I take responsibility.
Relax. Don't be scared.
Zoe, I...
Shh, shh, shh.
You guys... (CHUCKLES)
Your energy...
It's glowing.
It's amazing.
: 
(TAPPING) 
I still have something to show you.
(ECHOING) Come with me!
Hello?
Where are you?
(GIGGLING)
(VOICE ECHOING) 
(GIGGLING)
I just want to ask...
: 
Why is she so scared?
(PIG SQUEALING)
(GIGGLING)
You're not real.
This isn't real. This isn't happening.
(THINKING) 
(SIGHS)
(SCREAMS)
(SCREAMS)
Emma! Emma, stop!
Emma! Emma, it's me.
Dad? Dad! Dad, where did he go?
Who?
The guy in the Brandon James mask! Where did he go? Wait.
What are you doing here?
Your friends said they saw you walk into the woods. Are you okay?
So, you're telling me that you all got together for a big party, but someone, who wasn't here, dosed you?
That's your story?
It's not a story. It's what happened.
Whatever we were on, I was almost stabbed.
Okay? That happened. If my dad hadn't shown up, I would have died!
Did you see the person that attacked her?
Did anyone in this room see Emma get attacked?
I passed out early. When I woke up, the cops were here.
I didn't even realize she was outside.
: I heard her screaming, but I didn't actually see her, or anyone else.
Em, I saw a lot of weird stuff tonight, too.
It felt really real at the time, but it was just the Ayahuasca, or whatever he put in that stuff.
Yet another night ruined by Jake Fitzgerald.
Wait, Jake Fitzgerald was here? Tonight?
He's the one who put the doped up tequila on the doorstep.
He even signed his name to the card.
Look, if Emma says that someone wearing a Brandon James mask attacked her, then someone wearing a Brandon James mask attacked her!
Really? Any idea who?
Maybe you should ask your son!
He's the one who seems to enjoy drawing her covered in blood.
Dad?
(SIGHS)
I want you to have this.
To remind you that I wasn't always a bad father.
I really just want to help you. I'm just... I'm just...
I'm a little too messed up, so... I'm gonna go away for a while.
I'm gonna get some help.
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Maybe this time it'll stick, right?
In the woods... you really didn't see anything?
No, just you... in trouble.
(DOOR OPENS)
: Emma?
(DOOR CLOSES)
What happened?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Sheriff Acosta said you were attacked.
Mm-hmm.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Were you here for all of this? I thought I told you I didn't want you in the house.
Mom, Dad saved me tonight.
Just in time to play the savior. How convenient.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Mom, what does that mean?
Nothing.
(KNOCKS)
I didn't do anything. I didn't have anything to do with what happened tonight.
I trust you. It's okay.
Trash still needs to go out, though.
Okay.
(OBJECTS CLATTERING, DOOR OPENING, CLOSING)
(SIGHS)
(PHONE RINGING)
Mrs. Fitzgerald, thanks for getting back to me.
Yeah.
You might want to cut your vacation short.
I believe your son's missing.
You sure you're doing okay?
I know what I saw.
You believe me... right?
You've been so stressed out, lately... about seeing stuff that wasn't there... crap with your dad...
I'm just worried that...
I mean...
Maybe you were right before.
Maybe you weren't ready to come back yet.
Going back to that treatment facility wouldn't change anything.
Mm.
You were right.
Everything I need to fix is right here.
Hey.
Hey.
Last night was really weird, huh?
Yeah. Don't do drugs, kids.
Right?
Um...
One question...
Right before we, uh... you know, kissed... why did you apologize to me?
Apologize? Don't remember doing that.
Must have been the drugs. It was all about the drugs.
But probably not for her. She likes you. I can tell. Try not to blow it, okay?
: 
So, last night was really weird, huh?
Yeah. What was that?
I mean, I know what it was, but what happened?
I'm not completely sure.
Did you like it?
Yeah, uh, I think I did.
What about Audrey?
Seemed pretty tense when you were talking over there with her.
Oh! Yeah, I don't know. It's, um...
It's hard to tell with her sometimes.
So, what now? Do we have, like, a threesome going, or something?
I don't know about that, but, um... maybe we could go out again sometime?
Just you and me. (CHUCKLES)
Is it because Audrey turned you down?
It's because I like you.
You like your gay best friend too, right?
I just don't see it adding up to happiness, for any of us.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Hey.
I, um...
I just wanted to say I'm really sorry for freaking out on you last night.
You were... actually a really good guide.
I would have been totally screwed without you.
Yeah, it got pretty intense.
Yeah.
Maybe we should hang out again... sometime.
Maybe.
Cool.
Cool.
I can't believe I have to be in this freaking Lady of the Lake assembly.
(SIGHS) After, uh... After, you know, hallucinating all night.
(CHUCKLES) Well, if anyone can handle it, it's you.
I'll see ya.
Emma, hey.
Whatever it is, I am not interested.
Okay, that's fair, but I want to apologize for last night anyway.
Which part of it?
All of it, okay?
The party, what happened in the kitchen...
Nothing happened in the kitchen.
Look, you must be freaked out after what happened in the woods.
That sheriff doesn't get it, okay?
I could tell from his questions.
I have to go to the assembly.
I...
I want you to know that there's no doubt in my mind.
I believe you, even if Kieran doesn't.
Why are you telling me this?
I'm trying to help.
Telling me what you think I want to hear does not mean that you're helping.
It means that you do not get it at all.
Okay, I'm not trying...
If what I saw last night in the woods was real, there is a new killer out there, and all of that is happening again.
And that's why it gives me great pleasure to announce the five finalists that will compete in the up-and-coming Lady of the Lake Pageant.
As I call out your names, please come to the stage.
Andrea Conway.
Hey, you got this.
Jamie Blumhardt.
Where have you been? You almost missed it.
I got caught up at my locker.
Jennifer Gutierrez.
Zoe Vaughn.
And last but not least, our final contestant...
Brooke Maddox.
And there you have it.
The five lovely finalists to compete for the title: "Lady of the Lake."
