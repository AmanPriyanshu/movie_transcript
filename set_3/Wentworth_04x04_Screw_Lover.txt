Ha, you saw them, they wanna kill her!
We had a deal. I got you the conjugal visits.
Make it clear, that Ferguson is off limits.
: If you'd be willing to guarantee my safety...
Guarantee your safety?
Oh! I've been approved.
: Who with?
Daz.
But you're not even with Daz, love.
Why would they reject me?
A whole bunch of other women are getting conjugals. I should have been approved.
You can feel it?
I'll send you to the hospital for a mammogram.
Has anybody told you what really happened in the fire?
I couldn't save Warner, but I did save your son.
s*x has never really been my...
Well, maybe you've been doin' it with the wrong people.
Maybe.
I know the women want their pound of flesh.
You want me to bash you?
Give the women what they want.
You gonna kill me, or help me?
I'll protect you.
(Footsteps echoing)
(shallow breathing)
(piercing vocalisation)
(laboured breathing)
(fractured memories/)
(hummed vocalising)
(strange vocalising)
Ah-ha!
(shallow breathing)
Shh-sh-sh-sh, it's okay.
It's okay.
(laboured breathing)
: Just tell me, Joan.
Just tell me who did this to you.
Shh-sh, it's okay.
(Proctor crying)
It's okay.
: Okay, here they are. Okay...
(Ferguson sighs)
(sighs again)
(sighs again)
Was it Bea Smith?
(Ferguson sighs)
(laboured breathing)
It wasn't Bea Smith.
(inhales)
(whispered) Kaz?
Kaz?
Go to bed.
You've done all you can for her.
Come on.
What kind of woman does that to another woman?
Well, they're not all like you, Kaz.
Some of 'em are just f*ckin' arseholes.
We are in prison.
No one should suffer, like Joan is.
No one deserves to be raped.
Someone has to pay.
(high pitched thrumming)
(indistinct echoed P.A. announcement)
(indistinct echoed P.A. announcement)
(door opens)
: 
(high pitched thrumming continues)
: 
: Oh!
(breathing heavily)
Just get me a fresh pair, please.
(Ferguson winces)
Are you all right?
(Ferguson breathing heavily)
Okay.
(Ferguson gasping)
(exhales)
: 
(whispered) Come on!
(door bleeps and opens)
: 
Barrett.
Novak. Proctor.
Ferguson.
(over walkie-talkie) ...Joan Ferguson.
Ferguson?
(indistinct background chatter and noises)
: What's happened to Proctor's crew?
: Weird, isn't it?
: Mm.
Maybe she killed 'em in their sleep.
And then ate them.
Not funny.
(sighs)
So... real sorry but I'm gonna have to bail on laundry duty tomorrow, eh?
Mm, right.
And I said cannibalising, eh?
You wanna know why?
Can we put Miss Kaz on her?
Yeah! (laughs)
You wanna know why?!
Why, Booms?
'Cause I'm gonna be rootin' Daz all arvo.
: What?
Conjugals are back on!
How are they back on?
Oh, well, 'cause, ah...
Kel, from J-block, you know, she got the blame for cue-ballin' Mr. Lawson, so...
Yeah, with a bit of your encouragement, Booms?
No.
: Hm?
What?
How about I do your make-up and Bea does your hair?
Oh, yeah! Oh, do you reckon?
Mm-hm.
Oh, yeah, but (chuckles) don't do it like last time, eh?
: 'Cause actually it took ages to wear off, so I don't want that.
(Maxine chuckling)
Okay. Don't... don't get...
Guaranteed, it won't be like last time.
What do you think you might do?
Booms, Booms... just remember, she got knocked back, yeah?
Yeah, well, that's not my fault.
I know it's not your fault, but try and have some understanding.
Hey, Dors, you can do somethin' too, you could like iron my pants or somethin'.
: Iron your pants, it'd take a f*ckin' week.
You all right, love?
She's not even with Daz.
Everyone knows that.
I know, love, I'm sorry.
Oh, well, Nash is the father of my child and it's so unfair...!
You are kidding me.
Doreen.
Freak!
(others join in tapping)
: 
(rapid tapping)
: 
(frenzied tapping continues)
Freak!
Ignore them.
All right, settle down!
Settle down now, or I'll slot every one of you!
♪ (rhythmic drumming) ♪
(Maxine sighs)
Serve this woman!
(normal activity resumes)
: So, what's she doin'?
She in their crew now?
(Ferguson shallow breathing and shivering)
I thought she was takin' her meals in her cell.
Apparently not...
: So sorry. 
Sorry I have to go.
(gasps) I'm sorry!
: Go on, ya f*ckin' psycho!
(general indistinct background chatter)
I'm out.
Hey, what's going on?
What?
What are you doing protecting her?
Yeah, you know Kaz, gotta help a sister.
(incredulous) Sister?
(scoffs) She's not her sister.
She was attacked, pretty badly.
Did she say who did it?
Nah. She won't talk about it.
Listen to me... that woman is a psychopath, you gotta back away right now. Don't help her out.
If she asks you to do anything, anything at all, just report it to me, okay?
(scoffs)
She's like 50 and she can barely move. (scoffs)
I think we can handle her.
(sighs) You got no idea.
We need to find out who did the attack.
Find out who wasn't at breakfast yesterday.
(laboured breathing and gasping)
(gasps)
Just breathe, all right, It's all right.
(gasping)
It's all right.
(breathing heavily)
Shh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh.
Shhh. Joan, look at me.
Look at me.
(gasps loudly)
(breathing heavily)
Will Jackson did this to you, didn't he?
Didn't he?
sh1t!
He... he just needed to assert his power.
It's done now, that'll be the end of it. (gasps)
No. He needs to be dealt with.
Please, please, please, do not say anything.
If they know that I've been attacked they will send me back into protection.
(breathing heavily)
There I'm at their mercy.
Back away!
I know this is terrifying but we can protect you and we can take him on.
Oh, no. No, no, no no, no.
There's strength in numbers, Joan.
Haven't you worked it out yet?
Will Jackson and Bea Smith... it's how she survived, how she rose to power.
When I began at Wentworth...
I heard the rumours. I tried to expose them but I never succeeded.
(inhales deeply and exhales sharply)
If I had... neither of us would be here right now.
: Ferguson!
Piss off!
Pull your head in, Proctor. You've got a meeting with your lawyer.
(prisoners laughing)
(cell doors shutting)
(cell door opening and closing)
(internal door creaking)
Maxine...
Hello.
How have you been?
Oh, I'm okay. (exhales)
(chuckles)
(clears throat)
Now, I got your results this morning...
Mm-hmmm. and... I'm afraid it's not good news.
(stammers) The tests indicate some malignant cells.
(Maxine exhales sharply)
Has it spread, or...
Well, that... that's a conversation best had with the specialist.
Okay, every cancer treatment is unique, and in your case we need to consider your course of hormones.
I'll be able to keep taking them, my hormones?
We don't know yet.
Um... some types of breast cancer are oestrogen-sensitive.
The specialist will be in conversation (echoed) with your, uh, endocrinologist and together they'll devise a plan...
(indistinct echoed dialogue continues)
(door closes)
(music stops abruptly)
What happened about eating in her unit?
She claimed she had Kaz Proctor's protection, I wanted to see if it was true.
Well, I would have preferred to know.
(motorcycle revs outside)
(phone rings)
Sorry.
How did she manage this so quickly?
: 
Come in Sierra 7.
Prisoner Ferguson is refusing a search.
It was a supervised meeting with a reputable lawyer, this is entirely unnecessary.
Remove your clothing... now.
What happened?
I fell.
Clearly you didn't just fall.
: Bathroom tiles are very slippery.
It's filthy in there, you should look into that.
Underwear.
Turn around.
Bend over.
Who did this to you?
Told you, I fell.
In fact, the prisoners have been most supportive and sympathetic.
They facilitated my recovery considerably.
Get dressed.
Call the nurse... now.
Tell her we're bringing prisoner Ferguson in for a mandatory medical check.
I'm sure I don't need to remind you that my permission is required for an internal examination.
Then you leave me no choice but to have you sent back to protection.
There are absolutely no grounds, as it was an accident.
: I want to see all officers in the staff room in 20 minutes.
What's going on, Governor, where's she being taken? You all right, Joan?
Not your problem, Proctor.
: She is fine, move on!
: 
♪ (whooshing flourish) ♪
: 
So you're okay with it, are ya? That a guard attacked a woman and raped her.
What?
You know what I'm talkin' about, your toy-boy, Will Jackson, brutalised Joan Ferguson.
: What?
Oh, it's funny is it, you're all f*ckin' laughing?
: Yeah!
Is that what she told you?
(scoffs) He didn't do it, trust me.
Yeah, of course you'd cover for him, screw lover!
Hey!
Nah, nah, it's okay, Booms.
Mr. Jackson would never lay a finger on her.
She's playing you. (scoffs) I'd watch my back if I was you.
Victim's a liar...?
f*ck, I've never heard that one before.
(chuckles) She's no victim.
You don't know the history of this place and what she's done.
I know we've got a Top Dog who'd rather protect the screw she's f*cking!
(background gasps)
: Yeah!
(Boomer laughs)
: Oh, yeah, you wanna f*ckin' go, do ya?
: You're listening to the wrong person dickhead!
: All right. (exhales)
: You wanna bit, yeah?
You see that? She doesn't give a sh1t about any of them.
She f*cks the screws and then lets them abuse us!
There's your f*ckin' Top Dog... screw lover!
: You can't stick up for him like that, Bea.
Of course I'm gonna stick up for him. What Kaz is saying is utter crap!
You've just gotta be careful how it comes across, Bea, 'cause he is a screw!
Yeah, and she is The Freak!
What did happen to her?
Oh, Doreen, you're always at me. For f*ck's sake!
Oh...
(sighs)
She was ganged.
: Ganged, by who?
Dunno.
But you all know it wasn't Mr. Jackson, that's bullshit.
: Yes, love, we know that... but you gotta let him sort it out himself.
You can't be seen defending a screw. You know there's nothin' worse than that.
Hey... how'd you go?
Did you find out anything?
The Asian crew didn't know anything.
Well, what about Juice?
Juice was at breakfast, hon. But I'm on it.
(winces)
Are you all right?
Did you get your results?
Oh, it was benign.
Oh, that's great news, Max.
Yeah.
Great news, and you gotta do any follow up?
Or...?
No, none.
Oh, what a relief.
Oh, you are gonna sleep well tonight, love.
Yeah.
Like a baby.
(both chuckle)
: Great news.
(nurse clears throat)
Oh, Ms. Westfall...
I didn't know we had a scheduled appointment.
Consider this an informal check-in.
I hear you've been injured.
Quite badly.
Minor accident.
I bruise easily.
And how has the transition to general been?
Quite difficult, I imagine.
Actually, it's been something of a relief.
Oh, really?
Yeah, it's nice not to be cooped up all the time.
New company.
It's been quite instructive, seeing my former colleagues from a fresh perspective.
And what is it you think you see?
What I see is you and Vera Bennett pathetically trying to get me to admit to some imagined persecution. Anything so you can move me back into protection.
(phone rings)
An attack maybe?
: 
A ganging?
: 
Have you been attacked?
: 
Ganged?
: 
Um... no.
Do you know what I see?
I see you submitting yourself to this brutal ordeal... to serve some twisted agenda.
And I don't know... what you think you can achieve, other than death.
(Ferguson sniffs Bridget)
What happened to Frankie?
(Bridget exhales)
Bet you're missing her.
(door beeps and unlocks)
Back off, we've got her.
You all right?
(whispered) Just wanna get back to the unit.
(laboured breathing)
What did they do to you?
Not here.
You devious, twisted, m*therf*cker.
(winces)
It's okay.
It's all right, I've got you. It's okay.
: She has severe bruising... consistent with a brutal sexual assault.
And I am struggling to understand how that happened, seeing as she has been under constant guard for over 48 hours.
She put herself in general, that's how it happened.
It is my expectation that if I put someone, anyone, under guard, they will not be savagely attacked.
One of you must know something.
All right, then I am presuming... that all of you can confirm that at every shift handover, prison Ferguson was completely unharmed.
: She was fine when I got her from Ed.
Yep, same when I handed her over.
Rest assured, this isn't the end of this.
If anyone has any relevant information, I'd encourage you to come and talk to me privately. Thank you.
Have you considered that she might have done it to herself?
Proctor for you, Governor.
What happened to your face?
Um... I ran into a door.
The same door that attacked Joan Ferguson?
Apparently not.
All right.
Then who did attack her?
How would I know?
You seem to have taken Ferguson under your wing, as ill-advised as that may be.
She needed protection and you obviously couldn't or wouldn't provided it.
Has it occurred to you that she might be manipulating you?
(scoffs)
Are you saying she f*cked herself up to get me onside. Have you seen her injuries?
Then prove me wrong.
Tell me which prisoner did this.
What makes you think it was a prisoner?
: Where's Mr. Jackson?
Over there.
Hey, Bea, just about my conjugals...
Um, I'm about to put in my appeal, Yeah, not now Dor... yeah, but do you reckon you can have a word to the Governor for me?
Yeah, yeah, okay.
When though?
Not now!
Okay, well, thanks for the support, Bea.
: 
Hey.
What is it, Smith?
A heads up...
Ferguson's telling people you raped her.
What?
(chuckles disbelievingly)
No one's gonna believe that.
Proctor does.
Oh, for f*ck's sake! Okay, so Ferguson's playing her. who did attack her, do you know?
I don't know but it happened at breakfast.
Okay, wait... wait, breakfast when?
W-when, yesterday?
: Allie!
Allie, you're comin' with me!
Yeah? Jesus!
Out!
: 
I said, get out!
: 
You do love roughing me up in the showers, don't ya?
You take that back to Kaz and there'll be consequences, you hear?
You know... you could just say to me, "Hey, Allie, ah, woman to woman, "friend to friend, I prefer it if..."
You're not a friend of mine.
(laughs) You don't rule by charm, do you, Bea?
I'm not going to say anything.
Good.
(scoffs)
Yeah, cheers Allie. No worries, I owe you one.
Are you on with him?
Jackson?
There's definitely something there.
It's... it...
(quietly clears throat)
When my daughter died... he did something for me... he...
(sighs)
He did me a favour and I'll never forget it.
That's it.
Okay.
So, no s*x then?
Good.
When did you hear this?
Ah, before.
I mean it's just a rumour. I thought I should report it immediately.
And where... did this attack supposed take place?
Well, I-I didn't get specific details, possibly during breakfast time.
In her unit?
I dunno, Governor.
I mean, as I said, it's not a formal accusation.
I mean, I haven't made contact with Ferguson whatsoever.
Okay, so what's this then?
Here.
Okay, yes, I did escort her back to her unit after the incident in the yard.
I mean it was an emergency situation.
And then you remain in her unit, unaccounted for, for some time.
It would have been less than a minute.
I told you specifically, to have no contact with Ferguson under any circumstances.
Governor, if you think I did anything...
Oh, of course I don't!
But it is a huge concern that she has made this accusation, even informally, and thanks to your carelessness, you've left yourself wide open.
But officially, she's still saying she fell.
For now.
Oh, for God's sake, Will.
You know her. You know what she's like, just stay away from her.
(phone ringing)
f*ck!
(phone continues ringing)
Oh...
You wanted to see me?
Just heard a disturbing rumour... you know, about the conjugals... that your application had been knocked back, and yet Jenkins was approved?
Tell me that's not true, surely?
Really?
Hm.
It's ridiculous.
(sighs)
Governor Bennett's ruling, I presume.
Can I offer you some advice?
Jenkins.
: 
: 
Jenkins... open up.
I took it.
You want that conjugal tomorrow, I need to know you swallowed that pill.
Arrrrgggghhh!
Bit of toothpaste wouldn't hurt.
(coughs)
Mr. J.
Jenkins.
Rapist.
What was that?
Proctor, stop!
What was that?
This rumour you're spreading is bullshit, and you know it.
You gonna hit me now?
Don't be ridiculous, okay.
See, I've never touched a prisoner There are women in this prison who are real victims of assault, okay.
You're d... you're demeaning all of them.
You're demeaning everything they've been through.
You call yourself a defender of women, you're pathetic.
Nice speech!
Get Sal and call the others.
You all right, what happened?
He's f*cking crossed the line.
Who has?
Will Jackson, we're getting the reds together.
Okay, just hang on a second.
No, no, no, it's time for payback.
Hey, Kaz!
We can't do anything in here, we're on remand.
Allie, we'll just be really, really smart about it.
There's cameras everywhere.
Not everywhere.
The surveillance system is far from infallible, there are deficiencies... and as it happens...
I know every one.
Come on, Jenkins. Get moving, your hair's fine.
: 
: Don't touch it.
: I can't do that.
: Don't touch it!
: I have to.
No.
You look beautiful.
Whoo!
(cheering from gathered prisoners)
Come on, bitches!
I'm gettin' f*cked, awww!
Oh, yeah!
I'm gonna get f*cked!
I'm gettin' f*cked, yeah!
Yes!
I'm gettin' my f*ck on!
My f*ck on!
(muted song) 
You know the rules... two hours, condoms are provided. They're on the side table.
(door beeps open)
(chuckles nervously)
You been workin' out, Daz?
Yeah, yeah a little bit.
Yeah...
Cool... all right...
Hey, just wait, just hold on a second... what?
I... I reckon... your sister might be onto us.
(scoffs) Wh-why... what did ya say?
I said I was lookin' at a second hand Nissan.
Oh, yeah, that's good...
But then a f*ckin' screw rang up yesterday, doin' a cross check and she was in the next room.
Right, well, you're here now, yeah, so... might as well just do it, hey?
Nuh, what if she finds out?
How's she gonna know?
Well, I don't know, she might... smell me or somethin'.
Well, f*ck, just have a shower!
What, here... in a lady prison?
What? No, no, go to your mum's place on the way back, yeah?
I don't talk about Mum anymore.
Well, d-d... Daz... this is the first time I've had s*x in... er, oh, (chuckling) f*ckin' ages... so Darren, no well, think about it...
Hey?
Hey...
I'll do everything.
Everything, everything?
Yep.
Even the... (chuckles)
Yep.
(exhales)
Everything.
(exhales)
(gasping)
Huh?
(gulps) Whoa.
I guess, maybe I could... stop at Damo's on the way home Yeah. and have a shower there.
Yeah.
(exhales)
Damo's...
(heavy breathing)
(moans) Yeah!
(both moaning)
You can understand our position, Doreen.
I have always been a model prisoner.
Your pregnancy reflected very badly on this prison.
If I could finish...
(train rattling past outside in background, whistle sounding)
I have always been a model prisoner, and now peer worker... the day I fell pregnant, I was left unsupervised and unprotected amongst five visiting male prisoners... my legal advice suggests that's a massive breach of your duty of care, and I'd be well within my rights to sue.
There would also be significant media interest in a young Wentworth prisoner who ended up pregnant, via staff incompetence.
But... I might not take those steps... if my conjugal application were to be approved.
Who have you been talking to?
Oh, Doreen...
(Daz groans)
: Sorry.
It's the pressure.
(winces)
Me arm's gettin' sore.
Oh, sorry.
f*ck, is this 'cause of Trina?
No.
You only like it with her now?
No, it's not like that.
No? Mm.
No, you're still the best.
Trina? Trina never wants to do any of the stuff you used to do.
Yeah, like what?
Doggie style, nup. Motorboat, nup. Suck me off, nup.
Not unless you're just straight out of the shower. She never wants to do that.
She won't even discuss the other thing...
Oh... f*ck!
(Daz gasping)
: Oh, yeah!
Oh, wait, wait, hold on...
(Boomer chuckles)
No, no, no. No condom, you don't need it. No, you don't need it.
Wait, no, I gotta, they said I gotta.
You don't need it!
If you get... if you get preggers, I'll go to jail.
No... no, they won't blame you they'll blame me 'cause I'm meant to be on the pill.
What, wait, what?
What?
(whispers) Are you... are you tryin' to get pregnant?
Just a bit.
Hey, Dazza, come on. Daz... Daz?
What are you doin'...? Come on.
Come on, no don't do that.
I'm with Trina now!
Stop thinkin' about her, stop thinkin' about her.
You can't have...
Daz, please! I want this, I want this so f*ckin' bad!
Yeah, we all want things.
No. Worse than anything.
I'll be a really good mum.
Suz...
I will be...
I promise you, I'll be a really good mum.
Yeah.
(sobbing) I really will, I promise you. So, please, just please.
I cross my heart, promise. Please? (sobs)
I'm sorry, Suz.
Please, don't... come back. Dazzy?!
Oi!
Dazzy, come back!
(sobbing) Don't go.
(sobbing)
Split here.
When you get to the walkway, hug close and stay low.
Fromming it? *
And uploading, standard.
You right?
Yeah.
Don't mask-up 'til the walkway, okay?
Yeah.
Go!
: Yeah, this one's buggered.
Ha! Why am I not surprised?
(Liz laughs)
: Oh, Boomer!
: Hey, lovely...
: What is it?
: what happened?
Hey, what happened?
: Honey, what's up? Honey...
: Boomer... did you see Daz?
(Boomer sobbing)
: Oh! Boomer, love.
: What happened? Oh, darling...
: Did you see Daz?
Everything okay?
There's going to be an attack on Mr. Jackson.
What?
Payback, for the Ferguson thing. Now!
Wait... wait, where?
In the kitchen, he's on duty.
I've gotta go, sorry.
: 
: Sorry.
: What are you doin' here?
Ah, sorry. Yeah, I thought I'd left something there, but I...
: 
(door beeps unlocked)
Oh hey, that's the last of it.
Are we good to go, Mr. Jackson?
Yep, you're good. Thank you.
: Clear?
: Yeah.
Ricardo?
: 
Where's Allie?
Dunno.
Smith! Why aren't you at your workstation?
Smith?!
: You need... you need to call Mr. Jackson.
You should radio Mr. Jackson and tell him to get out of the kitchen now.
What are you talking about?
Hey!
Mr. Jackson, if you're in the 
Mr. Jackson, get out of the kitchen now!
Yep. copy that.
: 
: 
: 
: 
: 
: 
: Go on!
: 
(door beeps unlocked)
: 
: 
: Get out, now!
This is a Code Blue. Officer needs assistance in the dining room.
(siren wailing)
: 
f*ck!
Get back to your units, now, go!
: Go, go, go, go!
: 
All prisoners, return to their units.
(siren continues wailing)
f*cking Red Right Hand, I'm going to get 'em.
Yeah, well, slow down. If they were all wearing masks, you won't be able to formally identify them.
Give me five minutes with Proctor and I'll make sure.
You know I can't sanction that.
You... you know sometimes, Will, I seriously worry about your judgement.
What, because I care about my job?
That's exactly what Proctor wants you to do. No, to No, that's bullshit! provoke you into an act of violence. You just need to calm down and think.
Okay, so we just... we just let them get away with attacking an officer?
At least you didn't wind up with Hep-C.
Just tell Linda to send Smith to my office.
Fine.
: I'm so sorry.
I got stopped.
Did you tell 'em?
Tell who?
Did you tell Bea Smith?
What? No.
Allie, you were the only one that knew about that attack that wasn't there.
I got pulled in for a random drug test.
I didn't say anything, I promise.
: Might I make an observation?
The attack failed, yes? But Bea Smith was exposed, publicly.
Screaming for her lover, a screw.
For a self-proclaimed Top Dog, there is no greater sin.
You capitalise on that, it will be the final nail in her coffin.
Come on, Smith, you obviously knew what was going on.
I just wanted a chat with Mr. Jackson.
You grabbed Miss Miles' radio, you're aware that's a slottable offence. Just tell me what you know.
Nothing... sorry.
Could you give us a moment?
(door opens)
(door closes)
(Vera sighs)
I can slot Kaz Proctor... we can break this alliance with Ferguson, if you talk to me.
Please...
Dunno, sorry.
Miss Miles?
(door opens)
I will deal with you later.
(door closes)
: 
: 
: 
: 
: Not so popular now, are ya, Smith?
I guess it will give you something to think about when you're in the slot.
Right-o.
Bloody hell, Bea, I warned you about defending a screw and what do you go and do?
You take out a f*cking ad!
Oh, you know how this goes, Liz. I'll be slotted and then it will all blow over.
Well, you better bloody hope so, 'cause Kaz is revvin' up the women, and they all think you betrayed them.
Okay.
It's not okay.
She's not herself, is she?
Nup.
Been tryin' to talk to her and she just bloody ignores me.
We're supposed to be her family.
Mmm.
And I feel like the cranky grandmother.
(chuckles)
Wait, can you play the whole thing?
We have to slot her.
What, for warning me?
She disobeyed an officer and seized her radio. What other option do we have?
Look, just let me handle it.
I played right into her hands.
Bea, it doesn't matter about Kaz.
Now I've lost the women... the Governor's on my back...
Bea...
They'll probably neck Allie for tipping me off.
Bea...
It's just bull... bullshit!
Yes got it... bullshit! Now give it a f*ckin' rest will ya.
What's up your arse?
(sighs) Nothing.
Yeah, right.
Well, come on... spit it out.
Mm... (inhales) they found a lump in my breast and they have to cut it out.
What? Y... w... cancer?
Mm-hmmm, yeah.
Oh, Maxine... why didn't you say anything?
It's just a lump, Bea.
Oh, just a lump, it's bloody cancer.
And they're gonna cut it out and it's gonna be fine, it's not that bad.
We got it early and the doctor's not worried and neither am I.
Hey, but...
Listen, this is why I didn't wanna tell you. It's no big deal.
All right?
Y...
Are you... are you gonna tell the other women?
No, no! It weakens us.
Well, you think I give a f*ck about that?
: (knocks) Smith, you in there?
Yeah, just a sec!
Need a word.
Go on... f*ck off!
Everything's good. (chuckles)
(Bea sighs)
Yeah?
Thank you, Bea.
What for?
For what you did.
(exhales)
Right, let's go.
No, there won't be any action against you.
What?
Uh, but you have slot me, yeah?
You have to.
No, I-I just came to say thank you.
Mr. Jackson?
: Ugh!
: Oh!
: Oof!
: Uh, ah!
(Bea gasping)
: You f*cking screw! Ah!
(Bea gasping)
: You don't touch women, you hear me? Any women.
(echoed indistinct chanting from prisoners)
: It doesn't matter who they are, or you'll have me to deal with, f*ck!
You got that? f*cking screw!
(shouting and jeering from prisoners)
(slow motion yell)
(whispered) Oh, f*ck!
(Bea gasping)
(breathing heavily)
: Bea! Bea! Bea! Bea!
This doin' it for you Gazza, yeah? f*ckin' screw!
: Bea! Bea! Bea! Bea!
(prisoners continue chanting) Bea! Bea! Bea! Bea!
: 
She can't be that terrifying if she needs protection.
: She knows the system better than anyone, which make her the most dangerous prisoner in here.
Here we have our highest profile prisoners, including Bea Smith... who's currently in the slot, following an attack.
: Top Dog's in the slot, the women can finally breathe.
Ugh!
Argh!
While the cat's away...
Keep an eye on Ferguson and Kaz in case they try somethin'
: What's Ferguson up to?
: It's possible to love and hate at the same time.
: Smith's in the slot, it's the perfect opportunity.
: I'll never leave you.
: While Bea's in the slot, I'm Top Dog.
Does anyone here have a problem with that?
