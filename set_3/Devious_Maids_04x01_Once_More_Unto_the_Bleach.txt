Who are you?
I was working for you and your wife, Peri, but we fell in love, so we got married.
Why can't Spence remember me?
Apparently, this kind of memory loss can happen with severe head trauma.
How could I ever forget you?
You're the best maid my wife and I ever had.
Your wife?
Hello, Rosie.
I'm right where I belong.
: I couldn't even take care of myself, let alone a kid.
So I gave my baby away.
: Well, my book came out.
And it's on the
 Best Seller list.
Marisol, do you think we're getting back together?
Said you needed more time.
 said I needed more time.
I'm gonna go home to Seattle.
Zoila, it's time, huh?
Mom's crashing.
You need to tell me who to prioritize...
Zoila or her baby.
That is my petition for divorce.
Adrian, I've spent my entire adult life with you, and this ordeal has made me realize what a terrible waste that's been.
Where is Adrian?
Adrian!

My maid's been murdered!

[Thud]
Ow!
Damn it!
[Buzzer] What the hell's your problem now?
You stepped on me.
Please! It's your own fault! You died on my mark!
[Scoffs] I didn't die on your mark!
Are you having fun watching your book get made into a big studio movie?
Well, it's not... exactly what I expected.
In the book, Flora is stabbed and she falls into the pool.
Why did that change?
[Sighs]
Peri felt like the audience was paying to see her, so her character should discover the body.
But that's not what happened.
Take it up with the head of the studio.
I got bigger fish.
: Elliott!
[Sighs] I can't work with her. She is completely abusive.
All I did was politely suggest she not perform the scene like the brain-dead, no-talent pageant queen that she is.
Ladies, please.
Can we just get along for one more scene?
Oh, hi. Are you taking the dinner order?
: Oh, my God!
Are you still hungry after all the scenery you just chewed?
No, no. I wrote "Coming Clean."
The book that this movie is based on... ?
But you could still take our dinner order, right?
I'm glad you're here. I was thinking... shouldn't I be the one who goes undercover as a maid?
Wouldn't that be better?
No. No. This story isn't about you.
It's about the maids.
It's about... Latina empowerment.
Back me up here, Eva.
Mm, I don't know.
Do all the maids have to be Latina?
Seems kind of racist.
No, it isn't.
Not all maids are Latina, but these maids are.
If we change the race of the murdered maid, we can get somebody better than Eva.

By the way, you are the meanest person I have ever met.

Me.
Yes.
We are both survivors.
But the house was a total loss, so thank you for your condolences.
Adrian, how are you?
Still paralyzed.
But the doctors are optimistic.
And he did feel a tingle in his toes today, so our hopes are high.
Oh, you are a saint for taking such good care of your husband.
If you need anything, please don't hesitate.
Well, you're very popular at the club.

I adore you, my love.

Zoila!
Oh, I'm so happy you're back!
I was only in New York for a little while.
Yes, but this is really the first time we've seen each other since that sad, sad day at the hospital.
Right.
I hope visiting Valentina and Remi made you feel better.
Um... sure. A little.
But how is this working out?
Isn't Rosie the best maid?
Oh, yes, she is.

Rosie, would you be a dear and go make us some lunch?

No. That's not it.

I... don't feel good about taking the job from Rosie.
I do! I feel great about it!

I have a few concerns.
Well, shoot. Your concerns are my concerns.
Oh. Then why does it seem like you're about to leave?
Well, unfortunately, I have another meeting in... three minutes.

Well, don't you have anything to say for yourself?
Oh, I can talk now. Good.
Why don't we have dinner tonight... talk about it?
Are you asking me out on a date?
We obviously have a lot to discuss.
Wouldn't it be nicer to do it over good food and wine?
I shouldn't have to go out on a date to have my concerns addressed.
It's
 inappropriate.
That's too bad.
This was the best three minutes of my day.
Now, Peri, after your big win at the America's Choice Awards, I'm hearing people say "Oscar."
I'm just trying to enjoy the moment... shooting a new movie, enjoying my family.
I'm so blessed.
Now, I have to ask you something a little touchy.
Uh-oh. [Chuckles]
A few years ago, you all went through a very public divorce, but now you're back together.
Spence had an affair with our maid.
It wasn't just an affair.
You actually
 your maid.
I guess I did.
You don't remember?
Six months ago, Spence suffered a traumatic brain injury.
[Voice breaking] He almost died.
But that tragic event brought us back together.
Why
 I marry her?
[Chuckles nervously]
Well, as I've told you many times, you're an alcoholic.
Oh! Peri Westmore.

Don't you just love her?
Mrs. Genevieve, she's with Spence!
The man I was married to.
Wait.
 the maid who split up their marriage?
Everything she said is a lie.
She makes it seem like I tricked Spence into loving me.
But why else would he leave her?
She's America's Sweetheart, and you're... you.
It doesn't matter anymore.
They're getting remarried, and Spence still doesn't even remember me.
Rosie, may I give you some advice?
Stop whining.
I don't whine.
Yes, you do.
And if you really want to win him back, do something about it.
I tried, but I haven't been able to get near him since the hospital.
Well, then try again.
Now that Zoila's back, take a day off.
Or a week.
Really. Go.

You have tormented, embarrassed, and disrespected me in unimaginable ways for nearly 20 years.
I've wanted to leave you for months.
Then why are you still here?
Because you're in that stupid chair!
And what would people think if I left?
Well, I don't care why you're here... only that you stayed.
[Sighs]
And I'm going to make it my life's work to make sure you fall in love with me again.
[Sighs]
In the meantime, don't let me catch you near a flight of stairs.
Name?
Oh. Um...
I'm a hot girl.
I can see that.
And hot girls get into parties.
Not
 one.
Come on. Please?
It's my first week in L.A., and all I want is to go to a celebrity party.
Look, honestly, there's nothing special about these people.
They're just like everyone else.
[Glass shatters, Peri gasps]
Sweetheart, what are you doing?
Don't you "sweetheart" me!
I remember
 about Rosie.
You've been lying to me for months!
Now, calm down. I can explain.
You tried to keep her away from me...
[Camera shutters clicking]... but I know the truth.
And you're gonna pay for what you did!
Spence, you're hurting me!
Spence!

Okay, let's do this.
All right.
Ooh.

Oh, hello!
[Chuckles]
[Doorbell rings]
Oh. I didn't know royalty lived here.
[Chuckles]
Oh.
I was just having some fun.
Well, I like it.
And now I know I can wear my cape without feeling embarrassed.
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles]
I live next door, by the way.
I don't just come to random homes and make fun of people's clothes.
[Laughs]
Kyle.
Zoila.
Well, I'll be right over there, Zoila, if you need anything.
Oh, and this is for you... uh, a gift for the new homeowner.
Oh, actually...
I'm so glad I bought this house.
Ben!
Where the hell are you?!
Peri. Peri. Spence left the party.
But don't worry... I took his keys, so he's not driving anywhere.
I don't care about Spence!
Do you know where Ben is?
Uh, I'll check downstairs.
Ben!
Oh, my God.
[Sighs] Well, thank you, Peter.
This was a lovely evening.
I'm glad you liked it.
I really did.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well, um... take care.
"Take care"? [Laughs]
What does that mean?
Well, typically, it means "Have a good night and take care of yourself."
Yeah, I... I just thought you would go with, uh, "We should do this again" or "I'll call you tomorrow."
Nope.
Take care.
But I thought we had a pretty good time.
We talked all night.
No,
 talked all night... about Jesse.
And he's right... you
 still hung up on him.
I am...
Mm.
I wasn't finished.
Whether you know it or not, you're still working through your feelings, which is fine, but I'm a grown-ass man, and I've been around the block enough to know how this ends.
I just...
Still not finished.
I happen to think you're sexy as hell and smart... and a little bit crazy, which is exactly my type.
But I'm not gonna date somebody who's hung up on their ex.
Well, do you have anything to say for yourself?
I'm a little concerned about your wife.
When she learned about your prognosis, she was devastated.
I'm aware, but as long as I'm in this chair, she won't leave me.
Which is why I'm paying you all of this money... to keep my little secret.
[Groans]
Peri?
[Groans]
Ooh.
[Sighs]
[Groans]
Peri?
Peri?!
Oh, my God.
