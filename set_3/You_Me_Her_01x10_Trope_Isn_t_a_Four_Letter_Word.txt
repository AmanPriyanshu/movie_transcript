I love us.
Not just the s*x, but, like, us.
I know that you guys feel this just as much as I do.
We have careers. We have neighbors.
We're trying to have a baby, for God's sake.
So, you're afraid?
Of course we're f*cking afraid.
You don't deserve me.
Do I really have to ask?
I f*cked Andy, and I got to go.
: I'm gonna go home.
You are home.
No, like 
 as in Colorado.
I've been working crazy hours on this huge pitch for a fancy new theater at the Hamilton School where Jack works.
Very well done, Mrs. Trakarsky.
Thank you.
It won't be official until the Alumni Board approves it.
The Alumni Board?
Sor... uh, sorry?
Weinstock is retiring as dean, and he's recommending me as his replacement.
The Alumni Board has all your records.
They meet to discuss on Monday.
Can they really track my browser history?
This whole "niece that fell from the sky" issue continues to bother me.
You find Jacqueline Isabelle's last name and any social-networking site that proves her and Jack's big sister could pick each other out of a line-up, let alone share DNA.
I thought this was supposed to be easy.
Yeah, whatever happened to click, bang?
I'm not exactly a Photoshop wizard.
It's Ava.
It worked.
It's about the position.
We need to have a talk.
[School bell rings]
: So what about the position?
Your browsing history made us all feel sad and dirty.
No, no, no. That's... I think that's...
There's a million reasons for that, I think.
You know, my, like, my... my nephew once was watching, like, "Dora the Explorer" on YouTube and the next thing you know, he was actually watching, like, a p0rn that was called "Dora the Explorer."
So it's very easy to go from point A to point B.
I think there's, like, those pop-up ads that they have that just...
Are you f*cking with me right now?
I am.
Oh, my God.
We need to talk about you being named dean today.
Meaning it's happening.
Emma's firm won the bid.
They did?
She'll probably make partner.
Oh, my God.
That... that is great.
That's... that's unbelievable.
Get a huge raise.
Lots of money coming in.
So...
So?
I mean, what... what are you hinting at?
Just spit it out.
Look, look.
This isn't the first time in the past week that you've showed up looking like microwaved bison sh1t, Jack.
Okay. Can you fast-forward to the part where you actually say what you're thinking?
I'm thinking about the guy that I hired as a counselor 15 years ago.
I asked you why you wanted the job, and you gave me the best no-bullshit answer I've ever heard.
And... and keep in mind that I've faced down thousands upon thousands of teenagers and nobody can bullshit like a teenager.
Oh, God, Jack.
I'm so f*cking sick of teenagers.
Can you get to the part... what... what did I say in the interview?
What was the line?
You said, "All I really want to do is help as many kids as I can make it safely and sanely to the other side of 18."
I remember that.
That's not what I do as dean, Jack.
It's not part of the job description.
[Sighs] So, what do I do?
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what not to do instead, okay?
Don't do anything just because you can.
Don't do anything you don't love.
And don't do anything because other people think you should.
Oh, don't do anything because you're afraid to do something else.
How about that one, huh?

Which is never awesome, but, it's good for her, I guess.
