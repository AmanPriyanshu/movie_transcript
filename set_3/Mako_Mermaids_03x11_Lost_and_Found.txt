: See you later.
: Whoa, wait a minute!
What about breakfast?
What do you call this?
You'll need more than that to get you through a whole day of teaching.
They're feisty little mermaids, but I can handle them.
Right, Mimmi?
If you say so.
Maybe you should have one more prawn, just in case.
Why don't you come and watch me teach?
You might even learn something.
: What are we doing today?
Can we race to the reef?
I want to get legs, and go on land.
Walking is only allowed under very special circumstances.
But there's a dragon now.
If we learned to walk... we'd be able to escape it.
She does have a point.
See? Please, Ondina.
It's all very well to escape the water dragon, but there are dangers on land, too.
Such as?
Such as land people.
Such as getting wet and exposing our secret to the world.
All the more reason to teach them how to walk, so they fit in better.
I'm really good at fitting in.
Me, too.
Please, can we go on land?
: Please! Please!
Fine!
Awesome!
Yes!
And since Weilan is so keen on it...
I'm sure she won't mind giving us a hand.
I'm happy to help.
Does a Surf Burger really need this much cheese, this much lettuce?
That's how they've always been made.
The meat patty is so thick.
They're handmade, juicy and really popular.
There's always room for efficiency, and efficiency means profit.
She's teaching the little mermaids to walk?
 Wish I could see that.
We're taking them to the beach by the Western Lagoon on Mako.
You should come.
We'll need all the help we can get.
Sorry. I've got to work.
Here you go.
They should look very sweet in these.
And how will you be paying?
Ondina will fix you up.
: Ugh!
 We're doing it!
We're standing up!
Good. Now keep your legs straight.
And balance on both feet evenly.
Good. Now, to walk... put one foot in front of the other... like so...
Now, let's all give it a try.
They might need a minute.
They'll be fine. Come on.
: Mimmi!
Hey.
Hey.
I thought you didn't start until 9:00.
Yeah, I... I like to come here early.
Any particular reason?
There might be.
So, um... are you doing anything later?
Mmm, nothing's planned.
Any suggestions?
Hey, Chris.
Thought I might find you here.
Feel like a boat ride?
Dr. Ross wants us to go and check out some of the tagged turtles they released a while back.
Great. Where?
The Western Lagoon at Mako.
I was out at Mako not too long ago.
I saw quite a few turtles in the Northern Lagoon.
Uh, you guys should check there.
Must be different turtles.
GPS puts our turtles at Western Lagoon.
Mimmi, did you want to... come with us?
Sure.
My shift finishes at midday.
Sorry, Dr. Ross wants it done this morning.
Let's go.
Well, maybe next time.
I'll see you later.
Well done, Amaris.
Look up, not down.
: Okay...
Lift your legs. Don't be scared.
Don't worry. You'll get the hang of it soon.
Where's Amaris?
Did you see where she went?
You're the one in charge.
You're supposed to be keeping an eye on her.
She went that way.
I'd better go find her.
Can you look after the other three?
I think I can manage that.
You're doing really well.
Just... keep... walking.
: This is the "Cam Burger."
A thinner, flavor-packed patty... my family's own secret recipe, on a slightly toasted bun with just a hint of fresh salad.
It looks cheap.
Cheaper to make, yes, but we'll still charge the same price.
: The Surf Burger is our top seller.
And, frankly, the name "Cam Burger" is pretty lame.
Have a little faith, will you? I'm onto a winner here.
This will maximize profit by 30% per burger.
Can't you see what I'm trying to do here?
All I can see is you trying to change the most popular item on our menu.
Trying to change it for the better!
: There's nothing wrong with what we've got!
Boys! There is a civilized way to settle this.
Let a customer decide.
Someone who eats here, who knows the menu... whose opinion we trust.
Hey, guys.
What?
: Amaris.
Amaris!
Amaris, where are you?
Amaris, the entire class is waiting for you.
Can you hear me?
Amaris.
Hello?
Come on, Amaris.
Being the burger connoisseur that you are, we would like you to be our taste-tester.
 You mean guinea pig.
No.
Just give us your completely unbiased opinion... about the proposed new burger compared with the original.
Which, loosely translated, means... free food.
In that case, I'm in.
Excellent. I'll go source my ingredients.
We'll have the burgers ready around noon?
Can't wait.
Of course, if you need something to sweeten the deal, that's cool.
Sweeten the what?
Well...
Hypothetically, if you were to choose the Cam Burger, then I would, hypothetically... give you a discount on all future burger purchases.
Are you "hypothetically" offering me a bribe?
Don't be ridiculous!
You should know I'm not the kind of person to offer bribes.
I'm merely offering... a financial advantage for a certain outcome.
: Okay, everyone, take it easy.
Save some energy for when Ondina gets back.
Weilan!
Hey, I thought you were working?
Where's Ondina?
Amaris took off. Ondina's gone to find her.
We've got to get them off the beach. We've got company.
Girls!
Girls, get back to the pod as fast as you can.
Go! Go!
We better find Amaris and Ondina.
: Amaris.
Amaris!
You better come back here right this minute, do you hear me?
Amaris?
What are you doing here?
Where are the others? Don't tell me they ran off, too.
I sent them back to the pod.
Why?
Chris and Karl are heading here.
This is the spot.
The colony should be about 100 meters offshore.
We can dive in off the beach.
Hi!
Hey, come back!
Amaris!
She can't have gone too far.
She only just got her legs.
How am I going to tell Veridia that I've lost a student... on land?
Let's go back to the beach.
She might have found her way back there.
It's strange to see a kid here on their own.
Probably camping with her family.
A lot of people camp out here.
She looked scared, though.
It's because you're one scary-looking dude.
Maybe I should go and see if she's all right.
What about the turtles?
Don't worry. I won't be long.
She's not here. Where is she?
What if she's hurt herself?
: We'd better keep looking.
Mimmi?
What are you doing here?
...and I got so caught up at work that I completely forgot that I'd promised to bring Amaris out to Mako.
Who's... who's Amaris?
She's my cousin.
She's my niece.
So, which one is she, your cousin or your niece?
Mimmi calls everyone her cousin.
So, anyway, we moored the boat on the other side of Mako, and as we were walking through the jungle, she wandered off.
Have you seen her? She's about... so high. Blonde hair... shorts and a T-shirt?
Actually, yeah, we have seen her.
But when she saw us, she ran off.
We'd better go and find her.
We could help.
: Oh, no--
Ah, that's okay.
You need to take care of the turtles. I'm sure she won't be far.
No, no, no, the more people searching, the faster we'll find her.
We need to split up into teams. That way we can cover more ground.
Let's go.
Amaris!
You know, this isn't exactly what I had in mind when I asked what you were doing later.
Hey, uh... how did you get out of your work shift?
I forgot, I'd asked for time off.
Amaris has been looking forward to visiting Mako for so long.
Well, how come you're still in uniform?
It was all a bit of a rush.
I didn't have time to go home and change.
Let's go this way. The track's easier to follow.
: So... where did you guys moor the boat?
: We told you. On the other side of the island.
It's rocky around there. And steep.
Why didn't you just moor it in the lagoon?
Would have been much easier to get to shore.
You ask a lot of questions.
Amaris!
Please answer me.
I won't be angry with you, I promise.
I really need to know you're okay.
: What do you like to do with your free time?
: The usual stuff.
So you like shopping, movies, the beach?
All of the above.
Sounds like we've got a lot in common.
I don't think so.
Maybe we should hang out and see if I'm right.
Are you seriously asking me out?
Would it be okay if I was?
So that's a maybe?
: Amaris.
Amaris.
Uh, maybe she's gone back to your boat.
We should check.
: No, Ondina already checked there.
I just hope she's all right.
Don't worry, Mimmi. We'll find her.
This way.
That way's a dead end.
Oh. Do you come here a lot?
No. Why?
You just seem to know the place pretty well.
Amaris!
Amaris, come back!
Amaris, wait!
I won't hurt you!
Amaris!
: Over here!
She went down here!
Watch out, it's slippery.
She must have swum out.
Why was she so scared of me?
: Okay. You ready?
Ready.
May the best burger win.
Amaris!
: That was fun. We should do it again.
How do I put this simply and clearly?
Never in a million years.
 You've got a great sense of humor.
We should catch up soon.
Amaris swam out to the reef.
What?
Yeah, we need to take the boat and get her.
Hey! Look who I found.
Do you have something you want to say?
I'm so sorry for causing you so much trouble.
I didn't mean to worry anybody.
I shouldn't have run off. It was... 
 a dumb thing to do.
And I'll never, ever do it again.
Well, it looks like everything is fine.
Yeah, but how come you're dry?
: Mate...
She's safe. It's getting late.
We should get back. We can tag the turtles another time.
Uh, yeah. Okay, I'll see you guys later.
If you ever do anything like that again... you'll be cleaning the reef for a month.
Well?
: Mmm...
Burger one is satisfying.
It's tasty and subtle, without being overwhelming... and the balance of flavors is pretty good.
But it doesn't compete with burger two, which I have to say is nothing short of a taste sensation.
Burger two wins.
I'm sorry, Cam. His is better.
I only wanted to change the burger so we could turn a profit.
By switching from great-tasting, homemade hamburgers to cheap, frozen, tasteless meat patties bought from a supermarket?
Okay, maybe I got a little bit carried away with the cost cutting.
You think?
Just because one idea didn't succeed doesn't mean another one won't.
Business is all about ideas, and you have plenty of those.
Did I tell you about my hotdog taco idea?
: Am I glad today is over.
I am exhausted.
Poor little Amaris certainly had an adventure.
: I don't think she'll be causing any more trouble.
I wouldn't be so hard on her.
I know a certain mermaid who got carried away riding a water current when she was a hatchling.
As I remember, the pod was looking for her for days.
I have no idea who you mean.
I wonder what Veridia will have to say about it.
I don't think we need to trouble Veridia.
She did give you the job.
True, but... the mermaid council has far more important things to worry about.
Don't you agree?
Well, I think that that would depend.
On what?
On how interested a certain mermaid might be in... keeping her friends happy.
 What do you want?
I was thinking lobster dinners for a week.
 I was thinking two weeks.
Let's split the difference. Three!
 Good idea.
Guys, that's not fair!
