Are you busy tonight?
Depends what you have in mind.
It's very romantic.
I like the sound of that.
You, me...
Yes?
...a handful of customers.
I'm not working late again.
I'll make it up to you.
That's what you said on Friday when I filled in for Tanya.
She had a date.
Seems like everyone who works here gets to have a life, except me.
I'll doubly make it up to you.
Is that a yes?
You're management. I'm staff. What choice do I have?
Thanks.
You're just lucky I like you so much.
: Was it someone from the pod?
: Uh, I don't think so.
No.
And then she vanished?
You mean she cloaked.
I'm... not sure.
Are you sure you didn't imagine it?
Hey, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Then who was that mermaid?
See? Zac saw it, too.
I don't know who it was, but it was like she was calling to me.
Hi, guys.
Hey.
Hey.
I've just been called in for an emergency shift at work, so we're gonna have to cancel our movie.
That's okay. I'll walk with you.
Bye.
Bye.
Do you guys think Mimmi's okay?
If she was any happier, she'd be floating.
Hey. What are you doing this weekend?
Going out with my boyfriend.
He's a lucky fellow.
Yeah, he is.
So what are we doing?
I beg your pardon?
You said we were going out.
No, I said I was going out with my boyfriend.
What?
See, that's the problem.
I don't know which one of you I'm talking to anymore.
My boyfriend or my boss.
Well, I do wear both hats.
How am I supposed to know which hat you're wearing?
I'm really sorry I missed our day.
That's okay. We can do something tomorrow.
Actually, I'm playing football tomorrow morning.
Why don't you come and watch, and we can go out after?
Football?
Uh, yeah.
I'm playing at Suncoast High.
And bring anyone you'd like. We need all the support we can get.
Okay.
Ooh.
How were the dolphins?
: More to the point, how was dolphin boy?
Ondina!
Chris is fine.
He's playing football tomorrow. Will you come and watch?
Football?
It's a land people game.
They run after a ball and kick it into a net.
It's very popular.
Ugh. Thanks, I'll pass.
Please come.
Chris said that his team needs the support.
It'll be fun.
When was the last time you did anything for fun?
: I have fun.
: When?
: Being a boss is really hard.
: Mimmi?
What are you doing?
She's here.
Who's here?
The mermaid.
There's nothing there.
Mimmi, what's going on?
You can see her, can't you?
She's gone.
This... this is getting seriously weird.
You know, when she smiled, it was so familiar.
I felt like I knew her.
Do you have any idea who she is?
I think she's our mother.
: Mimmi, it's not possible.
: Why not?
When I saw her smile, something clicked.
I remember seeing her look down at me.
I remember feeling... loved.
You didn't see her?
I didn't either.
I am sure that it was Nerissa.
Nerissa's your mother?
The Nerissa?
She left us when we were very young.
A rebel mermaid called Aurora threatened the Northern Pod.
Nerissa wanted her children to be safe.
: I can't believe it.
Nerissa was like a rock star to us.
What do you know about her?
When Aurora turned on the Eastern Pod, Nerissa came to our rescue.
She fought alongside us for years.
Did you see her?
Mmm, once.
My grandmother was on the mermaid council and she introduced us. 
Nerissa was awesome. Brave and powerful.
And so beautiful.
What happened to her?
It's... not really clear.
Please... Weilan.
I need to know.
One day, she went off to face Aurora.
No one ever saw her again.
So, there is a chance she could still be alive?
Mimmi, I'm sure that if Nerissa had been able to come for you and Zac... she would have.
You saw what I saw.
But I didn't see anything in the water.
That doesn't mean she wasn't there.
 But Weilan said--
I don't care what Weilan said!
 Mimmi, we don't know how these visions work.
Maybe you wanted to see Nerissa so badly that you made me see her, too.
So... you're saying this is all just wish fulfillment?
 What I'm saying is that we don't know what this is... and until we do, we shouldn't be jumping to any conclusions.
Are we going to a baseball game?
When you are wearing the black hat, you're the boss.
The white hat means you're my boyfriend.
Interesting color choice.
You've got boss-Cam as the bad guy and boyfriend-Cam as the hero.
I was just trying to make it clear, as in black and white.
But I can switch them.
Let's not add to the confusion.
That's the beauty of this. There won't be any confusion.
I'll always know which Cam I'm getting.
Excellent work, Carly. Full marks for staff-management relations.
As long as you wear the boyfriend hat more than the other one.
Please tell me we don't have to dress like that.
They look like a school of clown fish.
They look like Tiger supporters.
: Hi, guys.
Great you could come.
Hey.
Hey.
Well, thanks for bringing everyone.
Wish me luck?
Good luck.
Now what do we do?
Wait for the game to start and then you shout, "Come on, Tigers!" or "Go, Tigers!"
Especially when Chris' team kicks the ball into the net.
How do you know what net that is?
The other team's goalie stands in front of it.
Goalie?
Just shout "Go, Tigers." A lot.
Go, Tigers! Go, Tigers! Go, Tigers!
They haven't started yet.
: Go, Tigers! Go, Tigers!
: Go, go, go!
Come on! Come on!
: Go, Tigers!
: Whoo-hoo! Come on, Tigers! Yes!
Yes!
Whoo-hoo!
Go, Tigers!
What?
The other team scored.
The Tigers are losing now.
Oh. We can help that.
One little twitch and the ball goes in the net.
That would be cheating.
Land people like to play games. Let them have their fun.
Whoo! Come on, Tigers!
: Go, go, go!
: Here we go, Tigers!
: Tigers, Tigers, Tigers...
Mimmi?
Don't worry. I'm fine.
: Come on, Tigers, let's go!
There's a guy over there complaining there's gum under his table.
Ugh. Yeah, I've looked under those tables. It's gross.
People have no manners.
We really should clean them.
Now?
No, no, of course not.
We'll do it after we close.
Just the two of us. It'll be fun.
So you're asking me to do this because you want to spend time with me?
Absolutely.
Of course, it is part of your job, too... until we finish.
Then it's just you and me, baby.
I... I thought you said you wanted me to wear the white hat more.
: Let's go!
: Whoo!
: Go!
Go, Tigers!
Go, Tigers!
: Go, Chris!
Here!
: Go!
Yeah!
He did that just like a dolphin!
You can teach land people anything.
Go, Tigers!
Who are you supposed to be now?
I've realized something. I'm not just a great manager.
I'm not just your boyfriend. I'm both.
So, to avoid confusion...
What do you think?
Seriously?
I think this isn't working.
: 
Might as well forget the rest. Tigers, Tigers, all the way.
Up on top and there to stay!
Go, Tigers!
Whoo!
: Kick it.
: Go, Tigers!
Whoo!
It's happening again.
She's calling to me. Come on.
What about Chris? What about the game?
Our mother is out there waiting for me. For us.
I know you want our mother back. I do, too.
But this isn't real.
We shared visions twice yesterday.
You can't tell me that that's not real.
My moon ring glowed again.
I think she's using it to make a connection with me.
I'm going out there to try the same thing.
No, Mimmi. You need to let it go.
Let her go.
It's all right for you. You have a mother and a father.
I've never had anyone.
You've got me.
Are you coming or not?
I'm sorry.
: We won! We won!
: Whoo!
Come on, boys! 
Good game, Chris.
Where's Mimmi?
Uh, she had to go.
: Is she coming back?
We're supposed to be going out after the game.
She said she'd catch up with you later. She'll be happy you won.
Well, why didn't she stay?
What happened?
We had a bit of an argument.
Mimmi wants so badly to believe our mother's alive.
Can you blame her?
Why did she take off?
 She thinks she can reach Nerissa by using her moon ring.
No. She can't!
Try telling her that.
Moon rings contain the power of moonlight.
If she uses it, she could summon the dragon.
We can cut through here to the beach!
Zac?
: Zac, what is it?
The dragon's chasing Mimmi!
Where is she?
Heading for land!
Which way?
 I don't know.
She's in the canal, near Evie's.
That's a dead end!
It's okay, sis. You're safe now.
: How did you get the dragon to back off?
I didn't.
It just went away.
It could have taken your tail.
Why didn't it?
I don't know.
You took a huge risk today.
 I just wanted to see my mother.
I miss her so much.
Next time you decide to do something really dumb and dangerous... will you tell me?
Same.
I love doing dumb, dangerous stuff.
You're right, Zac.
I need to let her go.
: Cam.
I have something to tell you.
Wait.
Before you say anything, I have something to tell you.
Me first.
I quit.
You quit?
You heard.
Well, I'm sorry, I can't accept that.
Why not?
I can't accept your resignation because I don't have the authority.
But you're the manager.
Not anymore. I quit.
You can't. You own the place.
Half the place, which...
I just sold to David.
So from now on, you're only speaking with your boyfriend.
You know, I always preferred him.
You big goof. 
: I'm sorry that I ran out on you at the football match.
I had some... family stuff to deal with.
Yeah, everybody has family stuff.
Why didn't you just tell me?
I've never had a boyfriend before.
I'm trying to figure it out as I go.
I'm no expert either.
But it won't work unless we're honest with each other.
Mimmi, I need to know straight up... are you in or out of this relationship?
I'm in.
