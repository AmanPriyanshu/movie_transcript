: Have either of you seen Rita? She's been gone all morning.
Veridia summoned her.
Sounds official.
The mermaid council want her advice about taking on the dragon.
The plan is to hit it with every moon ring in the pod.
That dragon is history.
Really?
What?
Moon rings didn't help my pod. They won't help yours.
Wow. Thank you for the encouragement.
I'm just telling you the truth.
: Have you got a better idea?
We need to do something about the dragon.
Mimmi knows a lot of spells.
I... I guess.
Could you trap it in a deep ocean trench?
Northern mermaids used spells to trap sharks in ice prisons.
See?
But this isn't a shark.
It's a magical creature.
So we need something that can trap magic.
Like?
Like... a Chinese puzzle box.
I had one when I was little.
We put a containment spell on them and used them for trapping rogue spells and broken enchantments.
How big are these puzzle boxes?
About... this big.
How are we going to get a 60-foot dragon inside that?
I could adapt a containment spell, cross it with a Northern shrinking spell.
Great. We'll get the box while you work on the spell.
Where are we going to find a Chinese puzzle box?
I know a good place we can start.
All set for fishing this weekend?
7:00 a.m. at the jetty. I'll bring the rods, you bring the bait.
We went fishing last weekend.
 And the weekend before.
And we had a really good time.
And I caught more than you, as usual.
 Fair point. What about the movies?
I was thinking we could do something else.
Paintball?
Rock climbing?
I was thinking we could take... dance classes.
Dancing's not really my thing.
You don't know unless you try.
Guess I'll never know.
Cam.
Please?
They have classes Wednesdays, Thursdays and Friday nights.
Sounds great.
I knew you'd like it.
Let me know which night works best.
I love markets.
You can find all kinds of stuff.
 Where do we start?
Mmm...
Let's try there. And let me do the talking.
That won't be hard. You don't stop talking.
Spit it out, Cam, before you scare away the customers.
It's about Carly.
She wants us to dance... together.
In public!
That is a great idea!
You two will look so cute together.
I'll look like a fool.
Couldn't you talk to her?
Maybe... convince her to drop it?
Cam, you and Carly are a great couple... but if you are serious about her... you have to put in a little effort.
Do some of the things that she likes.
You don't know how ugly this could get.
When I get on the dance floor, I'm like... a force of nature, but not in a good way.
I'm sure you just need to spend a little time practicing.
Seriously, this is not going to end well.
Maybe I could help.
: It's Italian leather.
It's a beautiful handbag and the color really suits you.
No, I do not want a handbag!
 Some people won't take no for an answer.
This has been a complete waste of an afternoon.
What are you talking about?
I got this dress half price.
I thought we were looking for a puzzle box.
We are.
You are. I'm going home.
You were the one who said we had to do something about the dragon.
Well, we're not having much luck here.
What about there?
: Doesn't look like they get many customers.
That'll be ten dollar.
 And that's just the start of the bargains.
Whatever you're looking for, Uncle Shen is here to help.
Perhaps a gift for family or friends?
Ah!
How about this genuine, authentic, Chinese jade vase?
Only 20 dollar.
"Made in India"?
Ah! Ugh...
Is anything in here genuine?
I'm as genuine as you get!
And I'm telling you, you cannot go past this gorgeous fan.
Carved in bamboo from the forests of Anji.
Keeps you cool.
Let's go, Ondina.
We have a better chance of finding a puzzle box online.
Wait!
You want puzzle box?
 Why not say so?
Today is your lucky day.
I do not show this to any old tourist.
But... I can see you're special.
Very fine box.
Hand carved teak.
About 50 year old.
It's beautiful.
Not many young people know about puzzle box.
Why do you want it?
Because... we really like puzzles. 
Oh.
And boxes.
Mmm. I like you girls.
Uh... I make you special price.
Sixty dollar. Best price.
Sixty is your best price? I'll give you 20.
Twenty? How do I put food on table for 20?
Fifty-five.
Thirty, including the teapot my friend broke.
 No deal.
Come on. We're going!
What are you doing?
 Keep walking!
Okay, okay. Sold.
You girls be careful.
That box is not a toy. It is dangerous.
One time, I got my finger caught.
Box was stuck on my hand for three hour.
We should go. 
Thanks.
Come back anytime. More deals coming any day.
We got it! 
 At a bargain price, too.
It looks a bit flimsy.
Oh, trust me. It'll do the job.
Okay, Cam, you're up.
Give it everything you've got.
Well, if you can do it, it can't be that hard.
Okay, now take my hands.
The basic steps of salsa are easy.
It's a forward-back shuffle over eight counts.
Now... watch my feet. Okay?
One, two, three...
 five, six, seven.
Now copy. One, two, three... five, six, seven.
What about four and eight?
Uh, you don't count them.
Hold on. Just... start with the simple version.
That was the simple version.
Okay, let's just try this again. Okay?
You count.
Okay.
And one, two, three, five, six, seven...
I can't open it.
It's a puzzle box. It's supposed to be difficult to open.
Once magic is trapped inside, you don't want it getting out.
Okay, once I put the spell on the box, anything magical that comes close will be sucked inside.
That's if you've got the spell right.
Don't worry, Mimmi's a genius.
Do it.
How do we know if it's worked?
Watch.
Imagine this water's the dragon.
When I bring it close to the box...
Bye-bye, dragon.
Or, you have a wet puzzle box.
: 
 one, two, three, and twirl.
Ow!
Sorry.
Evie, I should just quit while I'm behind.
No, no, no, no. No, just keep at it. You'll get better. I promise.
Evie and I had to practice for weeks before the school dance last year.
Yeah.
Look, what's the point?
Thanks for your help, but this is a waste of time.
You're overthinking it.
Salsa is just like walking.
Uh, if it was just like walking, I could do it.
 What was Carly thinking?
This is supposed to help our relationship?
What a stupid idea.
She's behind me, isn't she?
Carly, I didn't mean...
Carly.
Carly, wait!
Maybe the spell needs more power to take effect?
Ondina.
Was that supposed to happen?
I don't know.
Let's see if it worked.
 So what we have is an authentic, hand-crafted, useless Chinese puzzle box.
Maybe it needs more time to work.
No, it should have worked right away.
I need food. Failure always makes me hungry.
Hi, Carly.
What I said today, I can explain.
Forget it.
Okay. So we're all good?
I'll take that as a no.
Listen, what I said earlier, I didn't mean it.
Really?
Of course not. I never mean what I say.
Hmm.
I didn't mean that either.
Look, what do I have to do to not be in trouble with you anymore?
 So you want to get off the hook?
That'd be nice.
Fine.
You don't have to apologize.
You don't have to dance.
You don't even have to be in this relationship anymore.
You're off the hook... permanently.
Planning on getting a refund?
I'm going to ask Rita about it.
You're flogging a dead seahorse.
 Morning, girls.
Has anyone seen Poseidon?
Not since yesterday.
That's odd.
He never misses breakfast. 
I really have to run. 
 Can you look for him?
Of course.
: Oh, Rita, can I ask you something?
I'm sorry. I really have to go.
Um, see me at school, after the staff meeting.
Okay.
: Can anyone tell me the basic principles of Newton's Third Law of Motion?
Anyone?
Anyone? 
"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."
Eyes to the board, please. Copy down this formula.
Am I boring you?
What is that?
A Chinese puzzle box.
And would you care to tell the class how it relates to Newton's Third Law?
I didn't think so. 
You can collect this at the end of the day.
Poseidon? 
Where are you, furball?
I can't find him anywhere.
He can't have just disappeared.
Where's the puzzle box?
Weilan took it to school.
You don't think...
I did not follow a word of that.
I think it had something to do with the laws of attraction.
That's something Cam would never understand.
Uh, wanna get a bite to eat?
Sure.
: Ms. Trumble's in there?
That little box?
We have to get her out before anyone notices she's gone.
Don't touch it!
Why?
You could get sucked in there with her.
Weilan!
The box works.
I know. It took our teacher.
 Well, isn't that just wonderful.
It's supposed to only trap magical creatures.
Obviously, no one told the box that.
: How do we get her out?
Mimmi can reverse the spell on the box. Right, Mimmi?
 Slight problem.
It's irreversible.
So this box is randomly vacuuming up teachers and cats, and we can't do anything about it?
Wait, cats?
We think it took Poseidon.
Ms. Trumble's in there with Poseidon?
Poor Poseidon.
Oh.
Can we please just focus.
We need to get them out.
The spell's on the box, not what's inside, so if we open the box, whatever's inside should come out.
But... no one can touch the box in case they get sucked in.
What if we break it open?
With a spell?
With a hammer.
But we went through a lot of trouble getting it to work.
What are you doing?
Where's Ms. Trumble? She's late for a meeting.
Promise you won't yell.
: What are you doing?
: No! Don't... Weilan! No!
 There you are, boy.
Thank you for finding him.
What...
Come along... Ms. Trumble.
The staff meeting can't wait forever.
Staff meeting?
Mmm.
Oh, right, of course, Principal Santos. Right away.
: Bye...
You'll explain this later.
Hmm.
So... who's going to take it home?
Fine.
Luckily for you, Ms. Trumble has no memory of what happened.
I know you meant well, but you must be more careful.
Adapting spells makes them highly volatile.
Even if it could trap the dragon, it's far too dangerous.
You must admit... it works.
Yeah... a little too well.
We can't use it.
Like Rita said, it's too random.
It could trap any of us.
What do you suggest we do with it?
Poseidon!
Does that answer your question?
Hey, Cam.
 I need your help.
Sure.
What's up?
What's this?
I've been rude... and insensitive... and arrogant.
And uncaring.
Yes, all of the above.
The point is...
I'm in this with you.
So what do you say?
Shall we dance?
Wow.
I'm impressed. How did you learn to dance so well?
Guess I'm just naturally talented.
Turn and turn, now turn, turn... Oh!
Okay, I'm trying, I'm trying.
Turn, one, two, three. Good, good.
You know, this isn't that bad.
 I knew you'd like it.
You know me so well.
Don't forget hips, okay?
...five, six...
And across.
...two, three, five, six, seven.
